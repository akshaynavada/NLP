IT was advertised and NOT IN STOCK so I was unable to get it
I ordered the black one. According to the photo provided, it was supposed to be black with white seams, but when i received it, it was all black. Once I put it on it fitted perfectly. But it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size.
The actual bag itself was great.  However, the time frame it took to recieve the bag was not.  I ordered this bag and three weeks later it came.  I had to go buy a bag to take on vacation.  kind of defeated the purpose
I purchased 3 different Embassy purses last December.  None of them were the quality I had hoped for, and none were used as the gifts they were intended for.  In this case, the price should be a clue that the bags are cheaply made and not nearly as nice as they look in the pictures used.  I would not buy from this company again
This "pillow" is an inflated "U" that fits around your neck. One of the problems is, it has a rather sharp plastic edge around where it touches your neck. This can get pretty irritating the longer you use it.Fortunately, it is dirt cheap, so then I guess you get what you pay for.
I got this bra thinking it would be great for rigorous sports and my 38DDD chest.  Think again.  Go for the the ENELL sports bra.  I bought a size 3 and it is perfect.  No bounce whatsoever!!!  I was amazed.... don't bother with this one
...the shoes weren't quite what I thought they would be, although for 40 bucks I probably shouldn't have been expecting the highest quality pump. They looked a bit cheap, and on top of it all, they were too small for me. There was no return slip in the package, no number to call, no way to send the shoes back to make a return, so now I'm stuck with 40 dollar cheap looking shoes that no one but my little neices can fit into--and they're a bit too young to be dressing like ladies of the evening. My fault for buying shoes at a place called "Hollywood Heelz," I should have known better.I will say this though, I like the thin heel and the shoes came in a timely fashion. If I could fit them, I'd give them a 2-2 1/2 for that alone
I actually had to send this back cause of the size.  They run really small. 
The tie does have gorgeous color to it, but when the description says "good quality" its a little off base. 
the 2 bras i ordered were they same style, it even said so on the labels attached, however, they both look and feel different.  the white has a lot more padding, a rounder shape, and the lining is tearing away from the padding (part of the design).  The navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding (which is what I wanted in the first place) I was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had...in addition, I had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen I was not informed that it would have to be backordered.  not happy with my overall experience
I've had this coin purse not even 2 months now, and I've only used it about 7 times.  Unfortunately, the ZIPPER broke already! I couldn't believe it. 
I LOVE THE STYLE, FABRIC, FIT, EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE (BUT IT IS A T-SHIRT) I'M 5'2 AND IT DOESN'T COME PAST MY HIPS
The pic that I ordered showed a knee length half slip.  Instead I received 3 long half slips from Her Room.  I cannot use the long half slips and I sent them back.Also, I had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and couldn't find where to apply that, so the cost was put on my visa.Thanks.Jeanne Alle
Boots run about a size too big and unfortunately it cost $20 to return/exchange
I keep tyring to find shirts that are for these prices $9,10 or 11, where are they?  How do I find out
Got to be the toughest piece of leather a cow has ever produced!  I've literally never had a pair of boots that need THIS much breaking in and I own LOTS of boots.  Makes me not even want to to wear them
I have yet to reccived tham so I can not review tham till I reccive them.Thank you, Robert But
it's very poorly made. zipper didn't work when it arrived, and when I tried to pull it, thread was torn apart and beads fell... cheap stuff, shouldn't have ordered it.
The wheels on the bag lasted less than two months.  The bag is now basically unusable.
Very disappointing!  I ordered STRETCH jeans.  I paid postage to get them here only to find out they are not STRETCH jeans.  I called cust. service.  He spent enough time with me and another department to find out that these jeans must be mismarked and if he (Bealls cust.serv.) sent me another pair I would get the same thing.  In order to get money back I had to return the item.  Now I've paid postage again! and Yes I did receive the $12.99 credit for the jeans, but what about the postage?  This was not my fault!  The item was INCORRECT!!  Your Return Policy indicates that yo uWILL pay the postage, so if you need to see a copy (which I also put in the return box) of what I ordered, please feel free to contact me.  I printed it out so I can fax it, scan it & email it, or snail mail it, or however you would like to receive it.  Please return the shipping costs that I paid for a product that apparently mismarked.  thanks, Debbie Pearson P.S.  I see the title description has been corrected to show that these ARE NOT stretch jeans -- wish I would have known so that I would not have to be writing this review.  If no satisfaction is given there will be no more purchases via amazon, but especially not Bealls
Ordered the wand for x-mas and took it with us on vacation. When Santa came to the carribean the wand did not work. No light, no sound and cheap plastic that did not thrill anybody.
This is a beautiful sandal but the shoe was made from really stiff and ungiving material.  The footbed was uncomfortable and not a good fit or feel to it.  The price is right but there are so many sandals with gemstones to choose from I decided to return these sandals
The Scarf arrived with several holes in it. My daughter was very dissappointed, crying and wondering why Santa sent this to her. We ordered well in advance before Christmas but the set arrived too late. We were never notified that there would be a delay in shipping. A few days before Christmas it arrived! It was too late to do anything. Amazon should improve the quality control of vendors before it allows them to list on their site.
I love these boots and get a lot of complements but the strap broke already! Can I send them back
I bought these shoes for work to wear with my scrubs (with socks). I had to return them due to several issues: The inside lining was too slippery. I went for a brisk walk and my feet slid so much inside the shoe that they felt like they were on fire from friction! Tightening them did not work, as the top of the shoe tore away the skin from the top of my foot, leaving open sores. Even when walking at a normal pace, the shoe kept sliding away from my heel when I stepped. Thirdly, the sole of the shoe is very narrow; it felt like walking in ice skates! These were very cute...and may be great for biking, but not so great for everyday walking
I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting.  They were all made by this manufacturer (North Pole) and had different NFL logos on them (I only bought one through Amazon, the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues).At the first game of the season, my chair (Steelers) broke.  At the second game of the season, two more chairs (Bengals and Broncos) broke.  They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded.  They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked.  Therefore, 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours.Needless to say, at $25-$30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere
Item is not authentic. Kenneth Cole is all I wear and those shoes are not Kenneth Cole
I have usually found Jockey underwear to be a value in that they generally last a long time, which makes it a little less painful when you have to pay the premium price that appears to be controlled, no matter where you find them sold. However the last couple of their articles that I purchase through Amazon, namely the Pouch Trunk Underware, and "A" style under shirts appear fine out of the package but shrink to about half size when laundered. I wear a medium size (32" waist medium build) and purchased the same in both products. And both of these products are "painfully small" after laundered. I tried to wear them anyway, hoping that they would stretch out to their original size as the day wore on. But they were just uncomfortably too short, and tight.By the way, I laundered them in cold water, just like I do all my clothing
This is very cheaply made, from very poor quality fabric.The styling is not good, and the fit is poor.It does not resemble the photgraph.I would pay ( at most) $ 5.00 for this dress
IF YOU ARE A WEIGHTLIFTER OR BODYBUILDER, THE YOKE PIPING WILL CUT INTO YOUR LATS AND PECS UNLESS YOU BUY A LARGER SIZE THAN USUAL. THIS RESTRICTIVE BAND MAKES THE JACKET RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE. THE VELCRO ISN'T QUITE RIGHT EITHER. THE MATERIAL ITSELF IS NICE TO THE TOUCH, BUT THE DESIGN IS FLAWED...WASN'T WORTH EVEN THE SALE PRICE.
POOR QUALITY AND FLARED LIKE A MATERNITY TOP.IF YOU ORDER FROM LANDS END THRU AMAZON AND THE ITEM GOES ON PRICE BREAK,SEVERAL OF THE ITEMS I HAVE ORDERED HAVE GONE ON A PRICE BREAK.LANDS END WILL NOT AJUST THE PRICE ,YOU WILL NEED TO SEND THE ITEM BACK PAY FOR MORE SHIPPING AND THEY WILL RE SHIP,THEY DON'T CHARGE FOR SHPPING AND THEY ACT LIKE THEY ARE DOING YOU A FAVOR,THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL EVEN TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE ORDERED FROM THE DIRECT.THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL DO LITTLE FOR YOU SINCE YOU ORDERED IT FROM AMAZON AND THEY WILL TELL YOU UNTIL THEY AND YOU ARE BLUE IN THE FACE,THAT THEY CAN NOT HELP YOU BECAUSE IT WAS ORDERED FROM AMAZON.GOOD LUCK
I had to send this item back because it was to small.  The sizes run small, so beware
I wore the boots one time and it will be the only time. The boots are nice in appearance but very very uncomfortable. The material is so hard and did not give. I even wore socks and that did not help. I would not recommend this boot if you are looking for comfort
I was so disappointed in this product.  I bought the ad hook, line, and sinker, thinking that the memory foam was a great idea, that it would give me bilateral-plantar-fascitis-suffering feet some long-awaited relief.  After about 2 hrs of wear, the foam is completely flat, which leaves the formerly snuggly slippers sloshing around on your feet and you flapping about as if walking on cardboard. SAVE YOUR MONEY!  These are awful
Maybe, just maybe, someone will buy one of these Stick Up Bulbs and maybe, just maybe, the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out. I thought to myself "buy another one because maybe this one was defective." I bought three more.....every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use. It's a great idea....but a worthless piece of junk. The spare bulb? Useless as well. Don't waste a dollar on this junk. If I could have found the receipts I would have gotten my money back.
Poor fit for 80gb...stick on film to protect video face is a joke...it's cheap but save your money on this and buy something better
This shoe isn't as comfortable as my other Keds shoes.  It also doesn't breath as well.  If you have a tendency to develope hot feet, this wouldn't be a good purchase for you.  It also needs the new insoles that the newer Keds shoes have
after only one week use at home, the sole was completely broken. the worst quality slipper i have ever seen
This is a cheap and flimsy armband.  NOT THE ONE IN THE PICTURE.  There are much better on Amazon for less money
I thought the case was nice looking, but when actually using it, I was very dissapointed.  The case is not secure at all, it keeps sliding off.  If you have the little clip on iPod shuffle, I do not recommend the aluminum case
After wearing the Betula Birkenstocks for about an hour, the snap button kept coming undone near the buckle.  Happened pretty much every 10 minutes when i walked.  Midwest wont take them back since i wore them.
Based on the prior reviews, I fully expected to like these. Unfortunately, I don't, and won't buy more. They don't stay up. I don't have particularly large or small calves, and don't have that issue with my other athletic socks. Oh, well, buy and learn.I bought both white and black and they are equally disappointing
i bought this product several weeks ago. they looked nice but they are extremely sheer. they ripped right away which was very disappointing
The leather on these gloves is soft and supple. and they're warmthats about all that I can say that is good. There were scuffs when I got them. the stitching was ripping (and finished itself off soon after) and the fingers were different lengths on each glove. avoid at all costs.
I ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie. There's there's zero stretch in this, it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big. Since they're short from crotch to waist anyway, it doesn't much matter.The top fits better, since you adjust it. The cut is still quite poor and, again, there's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders. It's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust. It's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem.If you're narrow through the hips, shoulders or bust, this combo will probably be a nice fit. If you're curvy, you might want to rethink this. It's a shame since it comes in plus sizes. Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO
I think that these shoes are very sassy, but I ran into one problem ordering them online...they aren't true to their size.  I always wear a 6 1/2 but after putting these on, my feet were asleep after about 10 minutes.  Order wisely
After seeing the photo and reading the other reviews I thought this would be a good buy. I'm not really thrilled about this jacket. It's a flimsy rain jacket and not a stormbreaker. It doesn't have that good quality lining that gives jackets that heavy feel. This is something you can easily find at Walmart on sale for $9.99.
I bought this for my husband. We tried it in one car and it kept getting stuck in the lighter socket and the end kept coming off (it wasn't screwed very tightly and couldn't be screwed tighter). In the other car it fit in the socket all right but every couple of minutes you had to adjust the radio station and even then the music came through fuzzy. Also, if you turned the car off it doesn't remember which station it was tuned to. We are going to return it to Amazon, but I'm not sure how as I don't think they have an option for returning it as 'the product just isn't very good!' If you want something cheap and are ok with it not being particularly reliable then this is for you, but for hardcore music lovers, I suggest savinf up and investing in a better product.
Ok, I don't why this bra is available in any size larger than a B cup, because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust (I see that is available here in 38 DD, and I shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing).  It's comfortable enough to be worn around the house, under jammies, for a little support when just relaxing, but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day, this bra won't do it.  The front closure just doesn't allow for any lift or support.  Unless you possess a smaller chest, skip this one
This set is made of thin scratchy cheap fabric!  There is no shape to the gown...AWFUL
In my case, the boots were not quite true to size and definitely not wide enough. My feet ARE size 14 and EEE width (but some EE made on wide lasts can fit). The boots that I received were marked 14 EE but wouldn't even allow my feet half way in. I wish they fit because they look good, the quality is good, and price unbeatable. However, I lost $8.50 at the UPS when I sent them back
The views do not show the belt and buckle. I cannot tell from the photos if the buckle closes in the middle or is offset to the side.Why does this matter? For me, it's vital information. When I'm backpacking I carry my glasses/camera/pen/notebook in a fanny pack. Of course the backpack waistband buckle is in the middle, over the navel. If the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other.A few manufacturers are wise to this conflict. They make fanny packs with the buckle closure offset--between the left hip bone and the navel. The two waistband buckles do not interfere with each other.I won't be considering this product because I cannot discern the photograph
While the suit fits and looks great, my wife had a problem with the fact that the manufacturer placed a label on the outside of the suit.  It's really the placement that bothered her.  There is a black tag sewn into the middle of the rear seam, which from a distance, looks like one had an accident in their trunks.Thanks, but no thanks.  These shorts are being returned
These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply
I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again. 
I don't recommend you make purchases here. I spent $61 on these items and have only recieved two. There has been no explanation as to what happened to the rest of my order, or my money. Patiently I've waited for over a month for my items to arrive and nothing
I purchased these ear buds to replace those that came with my 80gb ipod expecting them to at least be comfortable.  I can't judge if they are more comfortable or not because they won't stay in my ears long enough to decide.  Even when I'm sitting still on the sofa, they fall out...none of the sizes work for me!!!  If falling out of my ear isn't bad enough, the sound is not even half as good as that produced by the stock ear buds.  Very disappointed!
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!! MY SON OPENED THE BOX OF SHOES TO FIND THE SHOES CAME WITH NO LACES!! HE WAS SO UPSET THAT HE WASN'T ABLE TO WEAR THEM RIGHT AWAY, BECAUSE IT WAS DEC. 24 EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY CLOSED AND NOTHING WOULD BE OPEN UNTIL DEC. 26, AND WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO PAY FOR SHOE LACES??? I'M GLAD YOU SENT ME THE E MAIL, BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO SEND THE SHOES BACK!! WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A BRAND NEW PAIR (WITH LACES) AT A BETTER PRICE.
These boots were the worst ever!  They were grossly missized and not as depicted.  The back of the boot had a tape with embroidery up it that was mysteriously not pictured when ordering. When returned, the company refused to reimburse shipping even though they acknowledged that this was deceiving. Never again
I loved this bra when I first got it a year ago.  It gave me great support, it looked great and I was the happiest with a bra that I have ever been.  My girls are in the F range so it has been difficult to find the right size.  A year later, the girls are headed south and the bra has no support left in it.  I am really disappointed in the quality after paying almost $70 for one bra.  They are on a great product if it could stand the longevity of time.  One year just doesn't work for me. 
I bought these at Target for my sons.  My six year old wore his two months until they fell apart.  Not too long in my opinion.
I am solidly a size medium, but I was swimming in this jacket.  I think it is more of an XL.  I'd say the medium is for someone 5'10" and 250lbs
The footbed on these clogs is very comfortable, but buyer beware - the buckles are attached with staples through the suede and come undone very easily (in my case, after two wearings) The seller's return policy is such that once the shoes have been worn outside, they won't take them back.  I had to sew the buckles back on.  In my opinion, $100 shoes shouldn't need to be repaired after two wearings.  The suede is also much darker than the picture - still a pleasant color, but not what I expected when I ordered
The advertising of this product on your site is kind of deceiving, because it doesn't properly show it. From what I saw on the Amazon site, I thought the wallet will be much bigger.  Amazon doesn't give measurements of the product, and there are not enough pictures of the it. Basicly it isn't worth it to buy a product if I'm not sure of how it looks like.  Now I have a wallet that my husband does not want, and I can do nothing with it.  I feel that I wasted $25.00
Poor design and fit, such that after 4-5 wears, the front of both shoes wore out - into a hole.  Not recommended
I could not believe the quality in these shoes...HORRIBLE!The material feels and sounds like cardboard or paper. They have an awful smell and are uncomfortable. I bought chinese shoes in china town for $2, they were wonderfully comfortable, still smelled funny, but they were awesome.these are not!
I bought this for the flashlight feature.  You have to press and hold the button in a clumsy way in order to keep the green flashlight on.  Also, the only way to have the clock light up is if you have the alarm on.  The buttons on the front are cheap and don't seem like they'll last very long
this listing isen't correct.item NTS1 is a nylon tank top shirt, not a t-shirt
I thought I was on the same page as crocs when I ordered the PWClog.  It confusing...I thought I was ordering a sale on Crocs.They are not Crocs..
I just received this dress today. Not only was it cheaply made (there are rhinestones missing, threads, and it doesn't flow smoothly), the top of the dress will have you falling out all over the place if you are in any other position than standing completely straight. Also, the support is badly made. I have a very small bust, but I don't think this would compliment anyone who isn't built like Barbie. Definitely wouldn't recommend. It looks great in the picture, but it's not being modelled on a real person.
These garments were so thin as to not do many of the things one expects of underwear.
The skin is fine and all the extras were nice. The one thing I really needed was a good elastic band for the arm. This product does not have a good elastic band. It's too thin and not durable enough
The other day I excitedly tried this bra on at Walmart.  I couldn't believe I could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store.  Unfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims.  Depending on the company I am a 38 DD or 34FF.  I tried this bra on in a 38 DD.  I was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support.  Basically under a shirt I sagged as if I was wearing no bra at all.  That is not the effect I want when I go strapless.  Only Goddess seems to have the ability to create full-figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety
While I can't agree with the other reviewer RE the quality of the 560 jeans (it seems excellent to me, having owned six pairs over the last two years, which I wear to work every day), and certainly as men's jeans, I don't think they're "out of style", I do have to say Amazon's price on this item is far, far out-of-line.  You can find these same jeans online elsewhere for $38 (with free or cheap shipping), meaning the cost is nearly $20 less than what Amazon is charging
I was disappointed when I got the shoes and one of them was made with inferior suede and very thin.I emailed the company I bought them from and requested an exchange/return many times. They never responded and I ended up keeping the shoes as I needed them for work. I would not purchase from this company again. 
I hate this bra.  The elastic band is NOT soft and rolls up as the day wears on.  Shoulder straps are skinny & inadequate.  Only good thing is that it is low-cut.  I prefer my $12 nursing bras purchased at Wal-Mart.  I only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low-cut
First time I've ordered a product from Leg Avenue - and it'll probably be my last!  I opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 "runs" in one of the legs before I even tried them on.  What a waste of money...and if I would pay to ship them back for another pair then I've already put way too much money into, what should be, an inexpensive product
I bought this item because it said "optional belt clip."  The belt clip is only "optional" if you "opt" to leave it on and not use it.  You cannot "opt" to take it off.  I would not call this belt clip "optional."  I would call it "will ruin your new phone case if you attempt to remove it," which is what happened to me mere moments after taking it out of the paper envelope it shipped in
the bra cup itself is too big for my chest. and although interesting to look at because it looks like a bra women may have worn daily in the 30's and 40's it is not at all comfortable.  blah!  and i love vanity fair so its disappointing for sure
Until today, 01/09/2007, I did not yet receive item Hi-Cut Brief 7_8701_1176 XL/Light Beigenor Bali Lace Trim Moderate Control Hi-Cut Brief 8044 XL/Light Beigeboth purchased on 11/30/200
First, let me say that I was VERY impressed with the shipping speed of this hat, which was nice because I bought this as a last-minute gift. Though, with that said, there is a BIG difference between straw and straw-paper. This hat is straw-paper. I'm afraid to see what will happen once this hat gets wet from sweat or rain. I really think Amazon should improve this hat's description
Unfortunately, the pockets are small, the fabric is poor quality, the seams already have started to split after wearing it twice.Overall poor quality.  I would not recommend these scrubs.  I personally will never buy from this company again.On a more positive note, they did get the right size and shipped promptly
she said it was not very good and ended up not wearing it at all
Don't buy these.  I used to love Florsheim (I still wear an old pair of Comfortech's) but I got a bad pair of these
I was so happy when I found these shoes, they are cute and comfortable, exactly what I was looking for. BUT after about two weeks of wearing them, always with socks or pantyhose, they started to smell terrible. I don't have this problem with any of my other shoes. This was SO disappointing, I will either try to return them or just trash them. 
I wore these socks once to a wedding; they had a "run" in them within a couple of hours. Admittedly it was an outdoor wedding, involving a longish walk on a dirt road, but it's not as if I was crashing through the underbrush (I was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up). Bummer the socks got ruined so fast; they were really pretty :-(
Would love to order these, but sizes are not clear.  Does small fit a toddler, is small a size 7?  Not sure how to order.
I received my sunglasses last week, they are increibles but they arrived in deficient conditions. they have three lines on them, and simply I feel that I lost my money.  I think that you should pay attention to the way eyeglasses are packed for transportatio
Ordered shoe in my usual size; shoe was too tight.  Bealls does not have an exchange policy whereby they will ship a different size at no charge; so I returned the shoes and got credit for the purchase, but not for shipping both ways
I bought the wrong size, the bra was too big, but the straps dug into my shoulders -- that's what wasn't soft...customer service returns was great though. (Essentials.com via Amazon
I purchased these for my fiance to wear for our beach wedding in Puerto Rico.  The quality is horrendous, the cut is for MC Hammer not real men, and the company charged me over $22.00 to ship them to me and then told me I wanted them Fed EX.  Not true, the pants were returned, the rest of my order cancelled and I will never purchase anything from this company again
 This shoe is cut right underneath the ankle. Everytime you walk the edge of the shoe rubs into your ankle and causes extreme discomfort and blisters.

The iPod Mini Case self is very good from Pacific Design. But Amazon made a mistake to choose eBags as their supplier.I have ordered one iPod and one iPod Mini cases for my friend's daughters as a Christmas gift. The iPod case was shipped from Amazon directly, as usual, it was nice packed and fast shipping. The other iPod Mini was shipped from eBags. It was bad, bad and bad. I won't order anything from eBags any more. Here is why:- It was almost one week later than Amazon's shipment.- It was an open, unpacked or returned item.- Amazon charges the shipping for that item, even you qualify for the free shipping on your order.If you don't care about all of these, please go ahead and good luck. I gave 2 stars is because of the product self, otherwise I would give none
I have white everlast boxing shoes & they are very comfortable & I thought these ones were the same. the difference is that the other ones have soft parts in it where the feet move when boxing.  The black ones are uncomfortable in the back side where the division of the shoe is.  They don't move well.  plus they charged almost $ 20. for shipping. so I ended up paying a lot for them.

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again. 
These are nice shoes, however the sizing is way small!  I would recommend ordering at least a size or two larger than what you normally wear
Do not buy from this company - I ORDERED AND PAID FOR THIS AND NEVER RECEIVED IT!
We bought this for our teenage son.  The handling of the shipping was prompt, that is the only good thing I can say about the coat.  I will definately agree with a previous posting that the wool seems to be of very poor quality, almost felt-like. The item that looked not so great after taking it out of the box, looked terrible after only a week or so of my son wearing it to school!  I am almost ashamed to send him out of the house in the coat. If it was not so cold, I would tell him to go back to the sweatshirt he was wearing!  The item pills making it look really shabby.  No reports of seams ripped, buttons lost, or holes in the pocket, however, he may be worried that if he tells me about those things I will be upset with him because the coat was just a waste of money.  It was a major clothing item that he had picked out for himself, so imagine his disappointment!  I expected much more of the coat than I got,  and I am looking for a replacement
I got this for my newborn son and it's so big- it fits my husband.  I wish it said something in the ad about this ridiculously big infant hat!!
I bought this great piece of crap about a year ago.  When I first used it, I followed the directions as indicated on the box.  Worked fair the first time, I mean I could have just used my dads power washer but no, I am a pioneer and want to try new things.  So then I used it about 6 months later to detail a neighbors car and it left SCUM EVERYWHERE!  This wasn't your ordinary scum, this stuff was hard to get off the car.  I spent a solid day scrubing the car to get this SCUM off the car.  So I swore I wouldn't use it after all that happend.  So today I decided to wash my car because I'm moving to Arizona in a day.  I used the power washer with a new bottle of Mr. Clean soap. I mean hey...what would go wrong....MORE OF THAT SCUM, so here I am now spending my day rubbing the scum off at least the windows instead of packing up the car...anyway you all know my feelings on this product.  Mr. Clean makes quality products but screwed up somewhere with this one
I cannot believe they put this on the market.  Once it gets wet, there isn't much you can do about wringing it out.  It's title is true - it is a water magnet.  The problem is it just won't let the water go.  This towel is horrible.  I suggest using the 3-pack microfiber Meguiar's towels sold by Amazon as well under the subject "Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber - Pack of 3"
As other reviewers mentioned, the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings.  It may be accurate, but dropping overpressure tires to a desired level ends up being a several-minute guessing and waiting game.  Calling it a "racing" gauge is ridiculous
i wouldn't recommend this product.  The positive terminal clamp broke in half the first time i used it... I, as I was stranded, rigged up a method to make contact with the terminal w/ the remaining half of the clamp.  Then the charger (which was charged fully the previous night) didn't provide enough power to actually turn the engine over.  I will be returning to the store tonight, returning this item, and purchasing a different charger
To turn off your check engine light on most vehicles, with your vehicle turned off, pull out and hold your trip odometer reset stick and then start your vehicle. In most cases the light will shut off. If there is truly a problem with you car, the light will either not stay off or come right back on. You do not need this device to do that. The second problem is if your car does need attention, this device won't really properly diagnose or certainly won't fix it and you'll still have to go to a mechanic. So I'm left wondering what good this is
This product came quickly but i should have listened to the other reviewers. They said the cushion would squash flat in a week and it has. Just spend the extra dough and get some thing of a better quality. otherwise you will regret it in the long ru
Bike lock manufacturer Kryptonite recently revealed that tubular cylinder locks -- which this model uses -- can be very easily picked. Kinda defeats the purpose of owning this in the first place.
The description of this product is NOT accurate.  These lights are NOT bright.  I have 6 mounted under the cabinets in my very small kitchen and all 6 on at once add up to the equivalent of a night light.  It is a pretty color of light, but very dim
These are more of an accent light than task lights...not what I expected.  should have paid attention to other reviews
It took 20 mins to fill a car tire from 20psi to 30psi.  Truck Air? -- It could barely fill a car tire.  It would take over 3 hours for it to reach 300psi if it even could make it.  STAY CLEAR. 
The oil must be removed through the oil drain to properly evacuate the contaminated oil from the crank case. And the oil filter must be replaced to prevent contamination of the new oil. Maybe you'll find this product wonderful and a cost-effective alternative, what do you do with the oil syphoned from the engine? A small but important cost of the oil change at a garage is for disposal of the oil.
after carefully mounting the solar panel outside my shed, in plain view of the sun, the shed light worked twice and has never lit up again. After the effort I put in carefully mounting the unit I'm very disappointed and don't feel like rolling the dice and seeing if the replacement will work.
We were expecting MORE of a cushion-feel to this seat, but all its really made of is a mesh fabric with little wires inside it to keep air flow moving.  It would be okay to keep your butt cool maybe, but for a cushion, its flat and cheap feeling.  As for "king size" it barely covers our car's seat...we ended up returning them...not worth it..
This product works well if you want to strip paint.  Do not use this product if you have any paint on your wheels that you want to keep ther
It does not work unless sunrays fall directly on it. I wouldn't suggest this product
We have had nothing but problems with the receiver.  We have it in our kitchen and it's no more than 30 feet from our son's bedroom.  Any time we walk near the receiver it beeps from loss of signal.  The beep is very annoying because it won't stop until you move out of the way.  If we open the fridge door it beeps also.  We've tried all the frequency combinations with no luck.  It is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds, even at low volume, until you change the frequency.When it works the sound quality is very good, although it is hard to lower the volume enough so at night you are not awakened by your child simply rolling over or babbling in their sleep. We recommend the Angelcare Movement Sensor and Monitor by Bebe Sounds.  The sound quality is great and it comes with a sensor pad that you place under your baby's mattress. It senses each time your baby takes a breath.  If there is no movement it sounds an alarm.  Great insurance against SIDS!
I'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product.  My wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory.  Unfortunately, because of the collapsible design this "bath" tub does not hold water, it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together.  There is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in, but it is useless.The sling is useful for bathing an infant, and the removable ring does it's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit.  Unfortunately, by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk.  I guess they call it Safety 1st as your kid can't drown in a dry bath tub
I registered for the entire Locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it. I love the theme, but the mobile was a big disappointment. It didn't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available, he just couldn't attach it safely and we ended up returning it. Also, although the mobile matches the theme, I found that the colors weren't very stimulating.We bought the Tiny Love Symphony In Motion Mobile instead and although the colors didn't match, our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it.
Leaking, slipping, can't use over the kitchen sink. Horrible Design. 
I have had this swing a little less than 2 months. I bought it for my 5 month old because she wouldn't sit in a traditional swing and I thought this looked like a comfy place to nap. It was a lifesaver til a week ago and and the motor burned up. I called Fisher Price and the part is on backorder til mid- May. I guess I just got a lemon because everyone else's seem to be fine. I am TRULY disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually exceed my expectaions. I paid $150 for this and it lasted til the water got hot and thats about it
I got this as my older son, 8, had the regular type of wedge. THis one doesn't keep my new infant from going from a side position to his back, nor does he stay at the same height on it.Every night he slides down from his head being towards the top to his head being between the wedges. This to me is a tremendous suffocation hazard. I was very excited to get this as a gift and had even registered for it, but have been very disappointed with it's performance. Also, the foam lost its bouyancy after less than a month. THere's an indentation where I laid my son.
this monitor makes random beeping sounds so lould that we thought it was the smoke detector. We even replaced our smoke detector thinking it was broken only to find it was this stupid monitor. Do not but this
The thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper. But it is very blunt!!! And the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible, unless baby's nail is very very long. If I wait until the nails are long enough to cut by this thing, my 3-month-old would have scratched his face and head. I end up buying a new baby nail clipper with a big handle and magnifying glass from nearby pharmacy. That worked much better.
I thought Tiny love products were good, so I bought this.  The first one I received had the water leaking out.  The second one doesn't make bubbles and after a few days the music already sounds like the battery is dying.  My baby seems to like it, but it does not live up to what it advertises
I purchased this rail today for my daughter's crib that "converts" into a toddler bed.  Everything on the outside of the box looked great, until we got home, put it together and put it on the crib.  There is only about 6 inches of space for my daughter to climb in and out of bed.  Also it sits in about 3 inches which significantly reduces the amount of sleep space.  After playing with it for awhile, I decided to look over the instructions again.  It states in the warning section that this rail is only for a bed with a box spring and mattress and is not intended for a crib or toddler bed.  My question is "WHY DIDN'T IT SAY THIS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX?!" 
doesn't dry your bottles at all. It leave a condensation and doesn't dry completely. I give it one star for all the stuff it holds, but water leaks out so you have to put something underneath it.
I bought this item despite the review that said it was too small. Big mistake. It is small! It's not big enough for my 21 months old. I'm very dissapointed because I liked the infant version. 
For the price of this cradle/swing, I'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than I got.  First, the stand seemed a little wobbly--you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they don't lock into an optimal position.  Even worse, however, is that after less than two days of use, the lights, sound, and mobile stopped working.  Calls to "customer service" were a complete waste of time and I ended up returning the item.  While the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable, I'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive Papasan cradle/swing
I registered for and received these Medela bags.  After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase.  Wow!! I will never go back to Medela.  The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak.  Well this is the only good feature.  The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top.  With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that.  My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that.  But neither has my Lansinoh bag. 
I thought this product would be helpful for sleeping, since it was recommended from a friend. However it doesn't work for me. I took it out of the box and it was just in a plastic bag. After trying it for 5 minutes I decided that I didn't like it and tried to return it. The company would only issue store credit because I "opened" it. What a rip off
I purchased this swing because we wanted something to take back and forth to our parents house. Though I am VERY sorry I purchased it. When you place the baby in the swing- the seat lays almost flat/horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position??)Very weird?? While it swings, I am afraid my daughter could end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Also, there is no head support. On the box it says that it is age appropriate from birth to 25lbs- THIS IS NOT the case. My daughter is only 4 months old and she can hold her head- but not too great yet and there is NO HEAD support with this swing. My daughter ends up leaning way over to one side of the swing- it doesn't seem to have the support that other swings have. I have another swing the head support and positioning of the way the swing sits is MUCH BETTER. To add- the mobile is horrible. It's really pitiful and hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market. The entire swing has a poor design to it.
Every single time, the reading is way low - around 94.9 or something like that.  It is extremely unreliable.  Don't waste your money
Okay, maybe I should have read the laundering instructions, which say to machine wash and then "drip dry" - but who makes BABY items that can't be machine dried? How many parents have the time to line-dry delicates?The upshot is that this fell apart - melted in the dryer and got fluff all over EVERYWHERE - the first time we ever washed it. If you need something you can throw in the washer/dryer when it gets dirty and not worry about sorting, this is NOT your product. Grrr
A great idea, but very time-consuming to put on.  My advice is to use a regular Maya type sling for the first few months, and then get the Patapum.  It's the least pricey of the "structured" carriers which are the ONLY ones that put the weight on your hips, rather than your shoulders, and therefore spare your spine. 
First of all the diapers get stuck in the lid, and then the room starts to smell like baby poop. Yes you can use reg bags for it, the only + about it. First day after changing the bag it smells OK but buy the 2nd WOW it stinks so badly and when you open it to change the bag the smell is unbearable.
I bought this product because my little girl always wants to use the toilet.  We have a regular potty trainer that goes on our toilet at home and thought this would be similar.  It is not!  It has not fit on ANY public toilet we have tried and slips all over the place.  She doesn't want to use it, which leaves me with nothing!  I would not purchase this product
Same thing happened to me as the person from the previous review.  They sent a pink pillow instead of the crib set, and will not honor the same price for the bedding set.  I have to send it back and they will give a refund.  What a hassle
When I learned I was expecting triplets, I bought a large inventory of these bottles which I thought were the best out there.  Boy, was I wrong!  These bottles leak, not just once in a while but with almost every feeding.  I am constantly "double checking" them in hopes they won't leak all over my babies.  I now cover my babies with a cloth diaper so that they don't get soaked when - surprise! - the bottle leaks all over them.  Yes, I've read the directions and no, I don't over tighten the bottles.  You can't take them with you for feedings on the go since they will leak all over your diaper bag or cooler bag.  They are especially leaky when I prepare bottles in advance and store them in the refrigerator.  There is something about the cold or condensation that affects the seal.  The bottle must be disassembled, the top wiped dry and then reassembled.  Lots of fun with three bottles - especially for 3 am feedings.  Even if I am doing something wrong, a bottle that requires this much precision in assembly not to leak is not a very good product.  If I hadn't bought so many, I'd throw them all away and get something else.  Take it from someone who is using these bottles three times as often - they are a waste of money and a source of constant aggravation
I bought the Baby Einstein Sea Crib toy based on its look.  I brought it home, put batteries in it and it worked for 5 minutes before it quit playing sounds.  I was also disappointed that the ocean sound only played for a few seconds.  I had thought it would play for 12 minutes like the music.  I took it back and purchased the Fisher Price aquarium and it is great.  It plays every sound for 10 minutes and seems more durable
I used this tub for my first born. This is small and holds very little water, therefore, the water gets cold fast! Also, there are holes where the tub folds up so the water spills out of the holes as the baby moves. It can be messy if you are giving your baby a bath on the floor as I did. Our baby would stick her foot and leg out of the tub because it's so small...when I used larger tub, that didn't happen.One positive thing that I can say about this product is that it's compact...I kept it at my mother's house and it didn't take up much space.I would recommend spending an extra $10 to $15 and buy a higher quality tub. 
Maybe in time I will figure this plate out, but I cannot get the suction to work and there were no directions with it as to how to take it apart, use the suction, clean it out. It may seem simple, but a harried mother needs these details! I am disappointed as it is utterly useless to me, at least as far as being a stay-put dish, which is why I purchased it.
These are a complete waste of money.  The nipples flow too fast for a newborn.  I tried using them many times during my return to work transition and my daughter choked and cried during each feeding.  She also swallowed so much air-I was burping her for what seemed hours.  The bottles are too expensive for just storage-you can purchase generic breastmilk storage bottles made by evenflow for $3.99...personally I like to use the storage bags laid flat in my freezer, they take up less space
I read Dr. Karp's book and decided to buy a swaddling blanket.  After doing a lot of research and reading a ton of good reviews on this one, I decided not to spend the $30+shipping on the miracle blanket, but get this instead.  Boy, was that a bad decision.  We tried a few times, and my baby unswaddled herself within seconds!  Granted, we had a big and healthy baby, who was strong, so maybe if your baby is tiny and/or weaker than an average newborn for whatever reason, it might work nicely for a while, but otherwise, don't waste your time with this.  I ended up buying the miracle blanket, and that WORKED!  Do yourself a favor, spend the extra $20 and buy the miracle blanket.  I could have avoided many sleepless nights if I did that earlier
don't buy this sheet!!  it is not much thicker than a piece of tissue paper!  spit up would go right through it.i have a much better solution for you--buy a couple of sheet savers to use in your pack-n-play.  they are a couple of $$ less and are sold as "especially for baby"(which is B-R-US house brand).  they are great.  i use them for both my son's crib and for the pack n play. they come in a number of colors so you should be able to match them to just about any pattern
I wanted something thick and soft so my baby couldn't feel the plastic under his sheet. This one is so thin you can almost see through it. There is hardly any quilting. Another down side is you have to take the mattress completly out of the crib to put it on. It is a safe fit, and washes well. I ment to give it 3 stars
IMPORTANT: Find a mobile with the option of it working, while being silent w/out music.I thought this mobile was great for the first 5 minutes, but then I quickly realized, I couldn't get the thing to shut up- darn it- they didn't put that option on it! How can this be? It is a $40+  dollar mobile. My baby just wanted to see it go, but the music, and sliding beads put him over the edge. This mobile is too loud, and the sliding beads are loud as well. It stimulates baby too much. Even after covering it up and arranging it under the bumper pad- it was still too loud.The motion is actually quite hypnotizing and great, but "Tiny Love" RUINED it by not putting a "silent running feature button" on it.  I'd pay $60 for it if it would just be quiet!!!If this mobile worked without sound it would be wonderful. As it is now, I can't use it that much- only when baby is at his happiest. Even then, the mobile wears him out- and ruins his happy state, because it is too loud.I think I shall pry it open and try to break the speaker.  I am serious.I rated it with one star, because I can only use it when my baby is at his most rested and happiest state. If he is the least bit tired, it overstimulates him and makes him cry. 
Had to return this item.  It was way too small.  Forewarned when you order that it won't fit an average baby up to six months.  I would say it would fit up to 6 weeks at most!!  It is very cute and would be a great addition to a Bundleme (cover), but the company needs to reanalyze their sizing.  More disappointing was having to pay shipping return on a $9 item. 
The seat is fun to play with, but that is also the problem. My son was so distracted with the features and songs he NEVER sat still long enough to go to the bathroom
I got so excited when I saw this tummy-time mat.  My enthusiasm was hedged when I read that the water pouch needed to be EMPTIED DAILY.  If had known that little detail, I would not have registered for this mat.  I must also confer that the neat little toys do stick together - bummer.  Honestly, now I am skeptical of any "tummy time" mat.  I think my boys prefer a brightly colored, patterned blanket, toys within reach, and lots of parent encouragement to stimulate their tummy time needs.  Better off spending the money elsewhere
If you research the toxic gas theory for crib death (which has been around for 15? years) you will see that this item can produce toxic nerve gases just like crib mattresses can. This product is not safe at all, no matter what they call it. Get a BabeSafe mattress cover to prevent toxic nerve gases from getting to your baby, and use only 100% cotton on top of that (between your baby and the mattress cover). Do not use polyester fleece or acrylic blankets or comforters and use 100% cotton blankets. Run from this product
I bought this hoping it would help my newborn calm down or sleep the same way a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner work so well.  This thing doesn't have a white noise sound but I thought maybe the Womb sound might work. However the volume was not even close to loud enough to compare to a hair dryer.  It's just become a toy for my older child who likes to play with the other sounds.
I bought this play gym because I figured it was a baby einstein play gym it has to be good...plus the reviews I read were good. Our local BabiesR'Us didn't have displays of the playgyms so I had no idea that this gym would suck.  I HATE IT!!  My son only loves it cause I put other toys on there.  Notice the pictures that people have shared who state they love this play gym and so does their babies that the toys hanging on the playgyms aren't the ones that originally came with the gym.  Why buy extra toys??  I paid $69 for this gym...it should come with more toys.  I tried to return this for the Gym by Tiny Love that comes with lights, music and lots of toys but when I opened the product the original packaging got messed up and I was unable to return or exchange.  What a waste of money for me.  I received another playgym that my friend bought for $20 from my baby shower. That only came with 3 toys and hung all these toys on there and my son loves that too.  My point is that you don't have to spend so much money on a playgym.  Your babies will love anything as long as there is lots to look at OR if you are going to spend money find one with lots of toys so that you dont 'have to buy extra toys. 
I will not buy these again.  They are tiny, thick and do not tapper on the edges.  This means you will see the lines thru your shirts. The adhesive isn't enough and the pads shifted durring the night.  I highly recommend the Lansinoh or Medela, they cover more, are thinner and stick better. 
We cannot get the refill bags into our Diaper Dekor Plus. Are there different size bags depending on whether you got the regular or plus unit? The lady in the store said NO so we bought 3 boxes of extra refills. Now we cant use any of them. What should we do
Overpriced! Not what I expected! You can't really used it because it's too small for big bellied pregnant women! Uncomfortable! The velcro gets in the way of sleeping comfy. YUCk
I bought this for my baby who, at 6 months was barely 16 lbs. She didn't hit the 20lb mark until she was past 18 months old, so she was rear facing for a long time. She loved kicking this but the mirror never worked well, I could adjust it and within a day or two it was all over and I couldn't see my baby again. The water seemed to evaporate and now just over a year later has hardly any water in it. We can't find any leaks but there's little water. The little fish inside stuck together right away and we could never get them back apart. Sadly we just gave up on it by her first birthday. It never worked for us as a mirror to see her and the toy part, while it was fun to kick at, was just worthless. My sister in law wanted one for my niece but I am glad she saw how worthless mine was before wasting her money on this
I thought this would be a great idea to keep the jars in, but really, it took up too much counter space.  I ended up putting it away and putting the jars into all the nooks and crannies in my cupboards as I personally do not have the space to waste for something that is completely unnecessary, I found.  Save your money
Don't buy this stroller. The only good thing about it is that you won't be sad if you leave it somewhere. The "restraints" don't restrain at all. My one year old twins barely stay in it so when we're in a store they can reach very far to pull down all sorts of things. (not safe) The stroller barely fits through regular door ways - and I mean barely fits. It does not maneuver well at all and is difficult to stear. The "adult drink cup holder" snaps off when struggling to go through doors and I don't have to describe what a mess that is. I'm just lucky I don't drink hot coffee; otherwise I would be suing the manufacturer for burns to the children. There is no storage. The "saddle bags" can hold a few small things but you should only use it for things you don't mind the children being able to reach. This stroller is not only a nuisance, it has potentially dangerous features, so please don't buy it
I swear -this is the crime!The worst product in the western hemisphere.Never,never buy this piece of garbage
Very disappointed. I bought this in hopes of relief from pain and pressure after I pulled a pelvic muscle at about 30 weeks pregnant. It has not helped me and has been annoying. The L-XL is too large but the S-M was too small. The material folds and rolls under my clothes and there's nowhere for the extra flap of material in front to go. I get sweaty underneath it and it's difficult to get my underwear back under it after using the bathroom---which I'm obviously doing frequently at 34 weeks! This was the only pregnancy belt available at the shop I went to. I wish I'd had the chance to try on others to compare
I registered for these bottles I am a new mom and thought the variety was great. We used the stage one nipple and my son was able to suck down his formula with no problem infact way to quick. He would struggle with feeding time. He was so gassy and had horrible reflux, that during feeding he would arch his back stffin his body and cry. I did have a recommendation to switch to the Dr. Brown bottles which made a huge diffrence. However, he was still spiting up and still a little gassy just not as bad and it was managable, their stage 1 nipples were to small and the stage two were to big. We had gone on a camping trip and I bought the Playtex disposable bottles for easier cleaning. I also had done some research on these bottles and found several people liked them better then the Dr. Brown. So I tried them and my son is doing much better he dosen't even spit up anymore. So if you like the ventair I think you would like the disposable much better. My sons Dr. wanted to put him on an antacid but I was not comfortable with giving him medication at such a young age I wanted to see if I could solve the problem, which I have done completly with the Playtex disposable bottles!
The bumper was very cute and colorful and I was excited to put it on the baby's crib...until I put it on...no matter how I tried to fit it onto the crib (it is a white spindle Jenny Lind crib full-size) it fit very akwardly and never quite right. There were large spaces where it should have fit snugly around the inside of the crib. I was very disappointed since it is very colorful and matches the sheet and comforter we received as gifts
LUCKY FOR ME I DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS PUMP BUT THE HOSPITAL GAVE IT TO ME. I COULD ONLY GET TWO DROPS OF MILK FOR EVERY TEN PUMPS. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. YOU WOULD FIGURE THE HOSPITAL WOULD KNOW IF THE PUMP WORKED
I would not reccomend this product. It was cheaper at Amazon.com than walmart, but It took forever to get. It took two weeks for us to get it. When caption said ships 5-7 days. Than when we did get it, several pieces were broken. Major pieces. When I called the company, (which I was on hold for 30 minutes) then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken (5) that we needed to return it. I told them no, it's over 100 lbs and I am 7mth preg. they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in 4 weeks. Another mth. So  it took almost 2 mths to get this product. It is not worth the problems. Plus, nothing was labeled, and you had to figure out what pieces were what. Plus, the shelves inside the unit are WHITE, the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white. I called the company and they said this is true.
I've tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week-old son.  I just can't get it to work so that he seems comfortable.  He usually cries when he is in it.  He fell asleep in it once, but he looked so contorted.  It's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way.  And the pocket is so deep it closes over his head. And I know I got the correct size. I've given up and am looking for a better sling.  Right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day, and he loves it, but it's a little cumbersome, and I want him to be able to recline.  
The Freedom potty trainer looked like such a good idea, but the plastic is very flimsy, and when set in place, it just barely reaches the floor. It's a pretty unstable situation. A separate kids toilet seat and footstool would be far better
I agree with all the other reviews saying the warmer with burn your hands and overheat the bottle. Especially when you only have a few oz in the bottle. The water in the warmer actually BOIL when it heats up and if the bottle got stuck in the handle, it means you have to use your bare hands to separate the boiled bottle and the boiled handle. You end up having a boiled hand as well. The worst part is it will burn your love one....Not only that, the cooler does not close well so the content will not really be kept fresh even the ice-pack is frozen before placing into the cooler. We switched to AVENT warmer. A little more $$ but it is much better. I would NOT recommend this product
I bought this toy bar for my second child and absolutely loved it at first.  My daughter loves to play and chew on the toys and it keeps her totally entertained for trips to the mall or doctor.  It fits beautifully on my Graco Quattro Tour stroller.  The big drawback is the turtle snack cup came off, revealing a screw, which scratched my daughters arm.  I feel Sassy needs to recall this item and make some adjustments.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the potential hazard of the cup coming off
Initially, I thought these angled bottles make a lot of sense so I put different sizes into our registry. However, when our baby girl (1 week old) first tried to suck the milk out from the bottle, it did not come out. My husband had activated the vent and did everything according to the instructions. He thought the holes were not big enough since he did not see any on the nipple, so he put more holes on them but still nothing came out. He finally found out the way that these bottles work are not the same as a traditionally bottle does. The hole will not open unless pressure is applied against it and hole will get sealed back again when released. Baby has to use their tongue to push against the nipples in order to open up the hole. For a newborn infant, it is too difficult for them to figure out how to get the milk out especially if you are bottle feeding only. Luckily we had two Avent bottles (with the traditionally hole idea) so she is doing very well with the Avent bottles and she still loves them a lot. We ended up returning the unused VentAir bottles and got a lots of AVENT bottles but still stuck with the opened ones. I do not recommend these 'difficult' bottles for newborn. Baby should not need to 'think' how to get the milk out.For leaking problem, we do not have any issue with the Avent bottles. When it leaks, it is usually because the nipples have not been properly placed (push all the way though the ring) or the ring has not been tightly screwed. We also found out if you use a warmer to warm the bottle, you have to unscrew the ring once and screw it all tight again after the warmer. It is because the theory of heat with expense the plastic bottle which creates a gap between the ring, nipples and the bottle neck. This works 99% for us with no leak.We are the fans of the AVENT bottles.
I just received this sleep positioner today and it is nothing like what I expected.  The description makes it sound like the wedge is adjustable - but I don't quite get how to adjust this.  It also says that there is a blanket.  Maybe I misunderstood the description because there is no blanket here.  I imagined the wedge would prop the baby up much more than it does.  At the thickest layer the wedge is MAYBE 2 1/2 inches thick.  I'm pretty disappointed.  I thought this was going to be the answer to my baby's sleep problems
I got this to make sterilizing easier. I'm not sure it does. It is kind of a pain. Cartoonish in appearance, cheap looking, cheap feeling,not nearly enough room for what you have to put in, you have to use a glass or something to hold the small things. Water does spill like crazy from the lid. Does it really sterilize? I hope so! I can't tell. Air vent bottles air dry, but one piece bottles will not dry no matter how long left out on the bottle drainer I have. Why? I don't know, the steam? Metal of heating unit isn't smoothed by company so be careful when cleaning you don't get cut! I was VERY disappointed! For that amount of money I should have gotten something of better quality! You pulled a fast one on us with this to be sure!
After spending over $30 for this item, we used it only twice and it ripped on the bottom clear across.  A seamstress said it could not be repaired and commented that the fabric was not very durable or strong.  Would not purchase again or recommend to others
I have to say that I just 20 min ago recieved this cover in the mail, (I ordered online because I'm so far from a Babies R Us location) and I was excited at first. The color is great, and the cover fit perfectly, but I haven't washed it yet. Actually I have to return mine already because a manufacturer defect in the fabric. The fabric immediately shred along the elastic in one area(middle of long side). I plan to exchange this cover for another of the same, I hope for better luck with the next one, but man, the hassle of having to mail this back and sit and wait is just frustrating
But after ordering it twice from Amazon, and having both arrive either defective or damaged, I give up on this stroller. First one arrived and it turned out after assembly that the front fork was funky - one side longer than the other - therefore making it impossible for the wheel to sit correctly. So we returned it to Amazon and were sent a new one. It arrived in a horribly damaged box but we put it together anyway...put my almost 3 year old and 2 month old in it and tried it. Veered to the right, and after close inspection, once again we noticed that the front fork was messed up, probably during shipping. Also my 2 1/2 year old's head was brushing the top of the canopy and this stroller is VERY heavy and hard to turn. (yes I knew the front wheel would be fixed and had anticipated having to lift it to turn, etc.)Too bad, I really wanted to like this stroller, but I just don't have much faith in the company anymore
I purchased this when I was due to have my second baby.  I thought Peg Perego products were supposed to be so great - and they are always so much more expensive.  I don't mind spending the $$$ if you get better, but this is just a horrible stroller.  It doesn't turn easily at all, the wheels constantly get stuck.  There is one cup holder that is soooo small and doesn't stay upright.  There is no room for any storage: bags, pocket book, keys, phone, snack.  They trays for the kids in front are so small and narrow.  the seats are too tight and small- they are not comfortable for the children whether they are awake or asleep.  There is nothing I like about this at all, it makes going out where ever not easy at all.  For the amounnt of money theu have the nerve to charge for this, they should be ashamed.  I actually use my orignal "cheap" single stroller, instead.   
This diaper pail is certainly the worst I have used.  It works ok for about a week and by the end of that first week I was ready to get a new diaper pail.  It does not keep oders in much at all, and I don't even put poopy diapers in it.  After about a week the springs started constantly falling off of the thing inside that supposedly keeps the bag closed and the oder out so it doesn't do any good.  Yes, a plus is the using regular bags, but so does the Diaper Champ and it also keeps oders in much better than this.  I'm definitely going back to the Diaper Champ; I only bought this one because it was the only one at my store, now I know it was worth the wait for the Diaper Champ in the mail
This is the flimsiest gate ever.  To boot it is not cheap.  I couldn't even use the screws that came with the gate.  I had to use nails and duck tape.  The instructions were wrong about sizing it up to fit your area and it took me over 1 hour to put it together.  Unfortunately when I bought this gate, there were only 2 reviews posted - one was good and one was not so good.  So I was a little confused but I needed a swing gate.  So needless to say - I wanted to make sure that I put my comments on so that no one else will get swindled.  This gate isn't even worth $1.0
I bought this item because our son kept on getting his legs and arms stuck.  This item was made for a portable/small crib, not your typical crib.  I had to go out and spend another $40. on velcro so I can make it long/wide enough to fit my son's crib.  It is not worth the aggravation in altering it to fit the crib.  Don't waste your money on something that is not going to work. 
I liked this tub at first.  The size was nice, and the sling was comfortable and good support for my preemie newborn.  After about a month of use, though, there was a horrible odor emitting from the mesh sling.  This was after "squeezing" it out as best I could and propping it up to dry after every use.  The sling is not machine washable and therefore unusable after it gets ruined by mold. I stopped using the sprayer after the first couple days.  It was just too much of a pain to fill it up everytime, especially since it doesn't even spray well.  The other reviewers are correct in saying that the button on the sprayer is difficult to press.  Especially when your hands are wet and slippery.It's a good thing BRU will take back anything!  I am off to return it and purchase the old faithful cheapie tub
It lasted a year and it goes in the dishwasher and that is all the good there is to say about it.  Now the bad!  The pivot point where the back attaches to the chair is poorly engineered and comes off way to easy.  Mine is warn to the point that my 20 month old can pull it off when he is sitting in it.  First he takes the tray off (also very easy for him) and then he pulls the back off.  At that point he shimmies out of the straps and is out of the whole thing.  Don't plan on it lasting through more than one child
I bought this pump because it was recommended by a lactation consultant.  I thought it would be the only pump I would need, but it didn't work!    I found this out at the worst possible time - the third day after giving birth when my milk came in.  I was completely engorged and my daughter was not able to latch on.  I tried this pump and it would not maintain suction!  I didn't have another pump handy and had to express milk by hand (very painful at the time) just so my daughter could latch on.  I have retried it several times using all the tips in the instruction manual and it never expressed any milk for me!  I was very disappointed with this pump and not able to return it.  A waste of money at a time when there was not much to spare
This is such a ridiculous excuse for a toilet seat lid.  It's easy enough to install but hello!  What's to stop anybody, especially a toddler from lifting the entire seat and lid together?  Not a thing!  The "kit" that comes with it to secure it to the toilet rim is a joke in that it rattles around like crazy and when it's closed, it doesn't fit snuggly around the seat so it's completely loose.  Total and complete piece of junk!!
I was so excited about this product because it was sold out everywhere I looked, so I figured it must be awesome. Not so. It is loud, which freaked out my 8 month old, and did not suck the stuff out of his nose very well. I've tried every aspirator on the market, and nothing works better than the one they use at the hospital. I took that one home with me, and urge you to do the same :)Very disappointed
First, the adhesive/velcro fasteners which attach this cover to the stroller were inadequate to say the least.  Second, it is opaque, so the kids couldn't even take in their surroundings. Since it resembles a parachute, the only reason that the kids even got fresh air was because the *stupid* thing wouldn't stay attached to the stroller, the kids probably wouldn't have had fresh air. Go for hats and sunscreen/protective garments instead
Besides the fact that the straps wheren't long enough to hold on to my son crib, it ended up on the floor every other day!!! Save your money and don't buy it!!!
My son is 5 months old now and for the first 4 months, the monitor worked pretty well.  We got a bit of static from time to time, but I would have given it 4 stars.  BUT...one night I woke up to reassure myself with the little green "on" light and saw that the monitor was not on.  Thinking it was a fluke, I turned it back on, checked the baby and went to bed.  But, over the course of a couple of weeks, it became more and more unreliable, turning off at will.  It was also hard to turn it back on.  I had to flip the switch several times before it would work. And, this is not a battery issue, since it was plugged in the entire time. I went to the Evenflo website and read the FAQs.  There's a mention of a problem with the power light going out, but nothing about the monitor itself going out.  Needless to say, we've thrown it away and have gotten a different brand.  I mentioned this to my friend with an 8 month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers - just stopped working reliably. She's bought a different monitor too.  Both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes.
The screws that come with the brackets are so soft they strip almost immediately --- was about to use my own, then read the review below and decided I'd be better off just screwing the furniture into the wall . . 
the middle back pocket broke within the first week we used the item. and were unable to fix the problem
I was looking forward to getting this toy for my son. But when I opened it up I was disappointed to see that there were only three tools inside the bag. I thought the picture showed several more tools. Maybe my tool kit was not complete. Either way my son never really showed much interest in it
the high walls on the snuggle nest made it impossible to try to breast feed over, and pulling the baby down to the open area as suggested, defeats the purpose of having the walls in the first place.  I would fall asleep breastfeeding and wake up later only to realize my daughter was unprotected. 
I absolutely agree with this review: "You will NOT get your moneys worth..., February 26, 2006"We bought this stroller per the recommendation of a friend of ours.  We have the sable color, which I see is not sold this year... but I digress.  We have been using this stroller for eight months with our eight month old and are absolutely fed up with it.My biggest complaint is the steering.  The front wheels slide sideways over any smooth surface and if we're not on a smooth surface, it feels like I am pushing the stroller into a brick wall because they don't rotate to allow me to push the stroller forwards.  I am always backing up and turning in order to get the front wheels to align so I can get where I want to go.  Shopping is a joke with this stroller because I cannot get it to navigate the aisles easily.The shoulder straps are attached to the back of the stroller with a little plastic tab which, really, doesn't seem like the best way to keep a child's shoulders restrained.  It ends up coming out from the tab holder and my son is virtually only wearing a lap belt.  This is fine now that he is able to handle a 3 point instead of a 5 point harness but when he was younger, this got on my nerves.The adult cup holder is a joke, so we took it off and my son figured out how to take the kid's cupholder out so it doesn't stay in any longer as well.Oh, and the thing folding down so that the handlebar catches the sunshade complaint is spot on.  SO FRUSTRATING!  Not a big deal, really, but poor design because the sunshade prevents the handlebar from locking the folded up stroller in the folded up position most of the time.I just remembered also, that the sides of the padding in the seat area, when I used this stroller with our Graco Snugride car seat,  would bunch up and prevent the car seat from sitting securely.  I would have to prop the edges of the padding in the seat area underneath the arm-rests of the seat area (the parts that say Aria) before I put the car seat into the stroller seat area so that it would sit deep enough to latch onto the cup area and allow the security strap to go over the carseat snugly.If Peg Perego could fix the steering, I think I would be able to live with the rest of my complaints but the steering factor is enough for me to trash the whole 9 pound thing now that I found another stroller that steers so much easier with my 22 pound 8 month old son
Do not buy this or any item from Baby Age.  Their customer service is horrible.  Amazon should remove all of their listings
Even though it comes with instructions, it is way too complicated to use. I was hoping to use it around the house but you need to know some acrobatics and balancing skills to get the baby securely in this thing. Not to mention, it shrunk 2 feet after I washed it (following the instructions, mind you). Now I have to tighten it in the back versus the front. It's now destined for the donation pile. The Baby Bjorn is easier to use.
I bought this buggy board because I was told it was better than my previous wood buggy board (wheel kept unscrewing)... however, I have two strollers I like to use so I had to pay 30 extra dollars to get a second set of connectors to attach it to my second board.  Today I called customer service because one strap broke... I was told it is normal if you live in a cold climate - in my case Manhattan - for the rubber to snap and break...?????? - luckily my daughter was not on it at the time! I was told not to use it in cold weather... I only use it on the weekends anyway so it's not out a lot and it snapped in less than three months.  Please save yourself money and grief and get another board
This is a cute idea but the suction cups are misshapen and don't stick to my son's highchair at all. Very disappointing
I have used these bottles fot two weeks with my newborn and I am not impressed.  My daughter was very difficult to burp and was vomiting frequently because of trapped gas.  I experimented with the Dr. Brown bottle and the Playtex Vent-Air.  Both seemed to help but the Playtex is by far the best.  People complain about the extra pieces but it is worth it to have a baby who is comfortable
This potty is completely useless.  It is so small that my three years olds' knees are up by his shoulders when he sits on it.  It is unstable on those little plastic legs and it's opening is too small for their little bottoms and it hurts them to sit on it.  This potty only stands about four inches off the ground so unless your toddler is the size of a six month old this thing is useless
After 5 boys my first daughter just HAD to have a pink highchair for her Princess 1st Birthday Party so I retired the boys trusty BLUE Graco (still in great shape after 4 years) into the basment and ordered this Pink one.  After what we paid for it ~ I don't know how to tell my husband I want the blue one back! (Maybe I can fnd a pink cover?!)  My daughter is 12 months old & 20 pounds and cannot reach the tray without dropping food into her lap.  There is a 3inch gap between her & the tray so half her food she tries to feed herself drops into her lap.  The thick padded seat is adorable & comfy for her but it has such deep crevices you really have to dig deep to get every crumb cleaned up.  The base is very large & her food falls down onto it after every meal so I am not only cleaning the floor but the base as well.  The buckles are awkward & impossible to do with one hand. If you have a petite baby ~ this is not the highchair for you
I purchased this item after hearing comments that a unit that heats from top down works better.  I was highly disappointed with this unit as it does not heat the entire wipe, wipes must always be filled to the top and the wipe cools down too quickly.  Unfortunately I don't have the original box therefore cannot return the item.  I am now going to purchase a warmer that is sold from One Step Ahead that also heats wipes from top down but is not something that attaches to a wipe box.  Through friends I have heard this other unit works great and have been reassured that I won't be disappointed.  Hopefully BabiesRUs will sell this other item in the future
HI I bought this seat thinking it would be great with the arm extension. I was so wrong! If your tub isnt made just right then it will not work and the seat itself is not secure. There are no suction cups to hold the seat in place either. I ended up breaking the arm lever off just so the seat would set level in the tub. But I have since purchased the aquababy seat ring and love it. It has the suction cups on the bottom and a release lever also toys on the front so baby can play. So if you are searching for a bath seat I dont recommend the safety 1st at all
I bought this pump the day I was discharged from the hospital (12/11/05). I have used it on a part time basis since I am staying home and nurse directly. However, the motor broke and couldn't pump anymore. My baby is only 5 months and this pump already broke. I have only used it during nights to keep a storage for my baby. I was lucky to call Medela on time since this pump is still under its 6 month warranty period so I could get my money back.
The kneeling stool is great.  The padding is sufficient and I love that it flips over to convert to a stool...Very useful!   BUT...the elbow pad is a joke!  There is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic.  Not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all.  It constantly pops off the tub whenever I put any weight on it.  I don't regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great. I suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews, you try to find it used so that you don't have to pay retail
I ordered two of these training rings - one for when my daughter is at home and one for when she is at her grandparents during the week.  One arrived in perfect condition, the other was disappointingly split at the seams.  So I returned it and had another one shipped back to replace it.  I received it yesterday and was upset to find that it too was also split at the seams.  So I am returning it once again and asking for a refund, since I feel I will be better just going to the store to buy one that I can inspect before hand.  To be honest, the one that arrived in tact works just fine.  I guess it is just the luck of the draw depending on if you receive one that is in good condition or defective.  Good luck if you decide to order this
I didn't like these for a few reasons. They take up too much room in my freezer. They take too long to thaw. I don't care for the avent isis pump. I have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and I can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker.
I bought this thinking it would be great, but have been VERY disappointed.  The suction cups don't stick very well (especially on wood)even if you wet them first.  My daughter is able pull it right off the table and dump the mess on the floor
I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT!  I WAS GIVEN THE SHAMPOO FOR CHRISTMAS WHICH WHEN WASHING MY HAIR MADE LITTLE TO NO SUDS.  WHEN TRYING TO COMB OUT MY HAIR AFTER SHAMPOOING IT WAS LIKE A BEES NEST AND I COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET A COMB THRU IT.  THATS WHEN I ORDERED THE CONDITIONER WHICH WAS LIKE CAKE BATTER AND COULDN'T GET IT TO COME OUT OF THE CONTAINER WITH REALLY QUEEZING IT WHICH MADE THE LETTERING COME OFF ON TO YOUR HANDS AND I FOUND SOME IN MY HAIR. I SQUEEZE AND BANG UNTIL I FINALLY GET A BIG LUMP COMING OUT.  I HAD WATCHED ALL OF JONATHAN'S REALITY SHOWS WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON CREATING HIS PRODUCTS AND COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL NATURAL. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!  I RECENTLY SAW HIS SHOW BACK TV WHERE SOMEONE CALLS HIM UP AND SAYS THEY TRIED HIS PRODUCT AND HOW HAPPY THEY WERE AND JONATHAN GETS ALL CHOCKED UP.  I WAS SCREAMING AT THE TV I WAS SO UPSET.  THE PRODUCT WAS NOT CHEAP AND CAN'T BELIEVE I CAN'T USE SOMETHING I SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON. 
RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN... DO NOT TRY!  Okay, so I bought in to the hype of "Blow Out".  Once I saw the "JONATHAN" product line on the shelf, I thought, "Hmmm, how yummy!"  Boy, was I disappointed.  The moisturizing shampoo was anything but!  The product felt like a mixture of tree sap and glue.  Once applied to the hair, I felt knots forming.  Upon rinsing, my hair like it had been stripped!  I used lots of the companion conditioner hoping for a balancing act, but was left aghast when I rinsed and felt the "new" texture of my hair.  I couldn't comb it out with a wide tooth comb until I applied a leave in conditioner from another product line!  Once dry, my hair felt gritty, brittle and generally nasty.  I'M TAKING THIS STUFF BACK AND DEMANDING A REFUND!  I'm going back to my Frederick Fekkai products immediately
This product totally frizzed out my hair. I had been having good luck for once with Paul Mitchell's foaming mousse. This Jonathan product,sadly, rather than taming my hair, induced the frizz. A lot. Perhaps a stronger formula is needed, or maybe I just don't have fine, limp enough hair I was very sad
Not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw.  Even my own sylist said, whatever you are using...STOP..you hair feels very damaged.  It goes back to normal texture if I use my other shampoos.  I made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the Jonathan shampoo..and it was.  It went into the trash.  Don't purchase this stuff...unless you're going for the scarecrow look
I tried doing a Patti Labelle do, where my hair stood up at an angle and it fell over all limp and oily.  My hair felt dirtier than when I put dirt in it
I have dyed red hair, a lot of dyed red hair. this product made no noticable difference in the shine of my hair. WIll not purchase again
I see several previous reviews that acknowledge the fact that this shampoo leaves your hair feeling like "straw" yet say that is because this shampoo leaves your hair so clean!  Are you kidding me?  If having "clean" hair means having my hair feel like straw and it does literally feel like straw, then I'll happily return to having "dirty" hair...seriously, I've had smoother, softer hair from drugstore shampoos that cost .99 than this 20 dollar shampoo and conditioner!  I could not even run a comb through my hair while it was wet because this product left my hair feeling so rough! I have rather dry hair, and I merely tried this product on a lark, just to see if it was any good because I am a fan of Jonathan and his show, so I will return to my drugstore shampoo, Dove and Pantene which have always worked well for my dry hair. 
I received this as a gift.  I was thrilled with the results the first few times I used it.  Then the little red light went out while I was straightening my hair and it has never worked since.  I only got to use it three times
I like Jonathan Anton & some of his products, but this one was a very bad one.  It smelled like swamp water.  His other products smell great.  I don't know what happened to this one. 
Okay, I'll admit. I bought into the hype. Oooo, no "sulfates"... Oooo, "essential water".... Oooo, "all natural" - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - "vegan" shampoo and conditioner...I headed into the shower with confidence that I had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair. And what a difference it made...the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely "dessicant" shampoo. And no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong! I tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results. After 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than I was, I returned the product.This product truly deserves 0 stars!!
Like many others, my perfume turned yellow as well. I think it only happens with the atomizer. Perhaps exposure to air SOURED the perfume. I am throwing it away as soon as possible because it no longer smells good. The product was bought for me as a gift and it came in a huge set. I am disappointed and sad that my friend spent about 60 dollars for a cheap product with a short shelf-life. I am never buying perfume from Britney Spears. Obviously the makers of the perfume did not perform enough quality control tests before releasing the perfume.
I do not like this shampoo at all. In fairness, I did give it two stars because it may not be good for coarse african american hair. It seemed to make my hair clump together and made it difficult to comb through when wet. The one thing that did detangle it however was the ojon hydrating conditioner which I do love.  Did have a pleasant scent and foamed up well
Actually, I would give the product 5 stars, and the packaging a minus-2. CityLips really does work, plumping and hydrating; it does required repeated applications. BUT the packaging results in about 10-12% of the (expensive) material being completely unavailable!  Worse, if you try to wiggle the (too-short) applicator in order to get the last 10%, the container breaks at the neck (actually, one came already cracked in my case!).  True, they do offer some colors at 2/3 price, but most effective is to apply clear, and go outside the lipline-and the clear almost never has gone on sale! 
I loved the smell in the magazines so I decided to get it.  Well...it was good at first...and then I got tired.  It smells a little cheap and sort of like pine.  I sometiems use it, but let me tell you it smells good on your armpits (that's what I use it for).  I think this smell reminds me of some kind of cologne that has been worn for tooo long
I haven't had an outbreak of acne in about 5 years until I started using this cream. I kept using it thinking that my huge cysts couldn't possibly be from this very pricey stuff. I went to the dermo and she said to stay away from these thick creams specifically for anti-aging because they are horrible for your skin. I went back to my cheap neutrogena lotion for anti- aging and it felt sooo much better and lighter and within a week my skin cleared up. I didn't even realize how very thick this stuff was until I started back on my neutrogena. I feel so bad about the $$$ I lost and I wish I would've gotten a sample first. I encourage you to do the same.
I love the smell of this perfume. However, it doesn't stay on. I have been wearing perfume for 18 years now and have used several different kinds without a problem. I was sold by SJP on this perfume when she appeared on Oprah. Loved it when I went to the counter at the mall to check it out. I have been using it for about 2 months now and it just doesn't last. About an hour after I put it on I (or my husband) can't smell it anymore. Trust me, I learned to apply it liberally and it still doesn't stay. Totally disappointed
The Philosophy states on their cosmetic's containers: there is no such thing as unblemished skin. Well, this is for sure true, when you use this Kit Kit. I have pictures to proove, that for more than a month of using Acne Kit Kit not even one acne spot dissapeared. I'm combining it with oxygen peel- this doesn't help either. I was as happy as young horse to have all this products for around $40: night and day cream, facial wash and blemish serum. All they do ( maybe except of the wash) is drying out the skin. Soon I have had to buy super-moisturizing revitalizing night cream and sensitive skin, high spf day cream( my skin started showing dark, sun-exposure spots, altough I WAS USING an spf filter) and finally no acne was or is gone. I dont get it- I was having better results using $0,97 hydrogen peroxide after toner than this hydrogen peroxide- based line of cosmetics. For the same price I could have bought stuff that really works-the one that Vanessa Williams is happy with. I know cause I tried it, didn't make my skin feel like Sahara and will be my next choice. Save your money. P.S. The oxygen peel is O.K. dough
I will admit, I am a sucker for hair products. I have very thick hair, that at times, can be a little wild.  I have used Fekkai products before, and their okay.  Certainly not worth the over inflated price tag.  But I read the reviews for this product and thought it might be the perfect solution for my hair during the winter months.  Wrong answer!  This product is very thick, too thick for me to spread through my hair without putting some work into it.  Conditioners and hair masks should be well, conditioning.  I left this hair mask in the required 20 minutes, and it did nothing.  In fact, I had to go back through my hair with my $6.00 Pantene conditioner just to make my hair manageable.  I also have to wonder what the purpose is of putting pieces of nut shells into a product that is supposed to condition hair?  All those pieces are going to do is rough up your hair cuticle.Ladies, spend your money on a book that reviews hair products! I did and I've realized that ALL hair products are essentially the same.  Only the name and perfumes change.  Read Paula Begoun's book about hair products
Not goo
I'm very disappointed with the results. I am fairly young, 31. I have very fine lines and i thought this would make them disappear. It really didn't do anything to my skin. Plus it is greasy and has an unpleasant smell. I do not recommend this
This product did nothing for my t-zone. I was still very shiney and oily by mid-day. I recommend Benefit's Dr. Feelgood.I gave this product two stars because though it didn't control oil for me, it didn't feel heavy or clog my pores
I quickly realized while in the shower that I don't want to smell like a margarita all day.   It does lather well and I don't find the smell to overpowering but it's not that special.   Warning to those of us that chemically treat our hair, this product as a shampoo is very drying and strips color out of hair. 
And it's called "Narcisso Rodriguez".   Buy the NR, you'll like it a whole lot more
I normally like warm, sensual-type perfumes, but I wanted to try something different for a change.  I liked the fact that this is advertised as subtle and not perfumey.  Well...I have to disagree.  I think it is VERY perfumey and not subtle at all. To me it has a very sharp, high-toned scent which is almost acrid. I thought at first that maybe I had sprayed too much on, so I tried just a little spritz.  Still VERY strong and sharp. And I agree with the comparison to dead flowers and dryer sheets.  I will definitely not be ordering this again. 
I've had this dryer for almost a year now, and like the styists who also own it, I find it temperamental. It does a great job while it's working, but the thermostat gets progressively buggier after about three months. If you turn the dryer off, you'll have to wait for it to cool completely before it will turn back on. Now, it turns off while I'm in the middle of doing my hair. The stylists have three or four of these so they can alternate working with one while the other(s) cool off - as I said, when they work, they're terrific. I'm going to replace mine with another brand
After reading reviews of the other philosophy items, I was hoping this would smell more like a strawberry milkshake than fake strawberry Quick.
I have this gloss in Carney. While I like the color, the gloss is very gooey and gloppy and it doesn't stay on long at all. I would not buy it again
My fiance' left this bottle of Prada on top of her jewelry box and the next time she went to use it, IT WAS EMPTY !!!  Seems the perfume was siphoned up and into the atomizer (pump sprayer) and then it ALL LEAKED OUT and down the bottle "glueing" itself to the jewelry box.  Now we have an EMPTY BOTTLE OF PRADA and A RUINED FINISH on the top of the jewelry box. I have sent Sephora an email explaining what had happened, but have not heard back from them. Beware of where you keep this bottle !!!
I use the Philosophy 3-in-1 WITH CONDITIONER. It works great and keeps my hair luscious. The one time I accidentally bought a 3-in-1 that didn't have conditioner in it, my hair dried out after two washes and got horrible split ends. After only three applications I had to throw the bottle out. I lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair. I don't understand how their products can vary so widely in quality, but they do.This is one of their better scents, however.  I would recommend using this as a body wash only
I tried this mascara expecting great things but was very disappointed.  The mascara seemed dry and it took too long to apply enough so that it even looked like I had lashes (my natural lashes are almost clear).  Back to the drawing board of looking for the Holy Grail of mascara
I thought this was tea. HOLY [...] WAS I IN FOR A SURPRISE? DID ANYONE ELSE THINK THIS WAS TEA? IT [...] I COULDN'T GET THAT TASTE OUT OF MY MOUTH FOR ABOUT FOUR WEEKS
Maybe I expect too much.  However, even my lowest expectation wasnt met.  Just go ask a dermatologist to help, dont waste your money
Yikes.  I was so surprised at the size of the bottle.  I had no idea it would be that small for the price. The scent is nice but I would not reorder. 
I love Clinique products and have used them for more than 20 years. The Exfoliating Scrub is convenient because it comes in a tube and rinses off easily. (though you only get 3.4 oz., and must use quite a bit of it to see good results). However, it does not work as well as the original "Seven Day Scrub". The original product while greasy and a bit of a pain to use, exfoliates almost as well as professional microdermabrasion and does not irritate - even with daily use. A few years ago I spent the summer neglecting to use my sun block. Needless to say, my skin became a mess (dull, blotchy, discolorations, rough, flaky, etc.). I began my basic Clinique regimen (Mild Facial Soap, Clarifying lotion #2, Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion, and the Seven Day Srub). In less than two weeks I saw a huge difference, my skin was back to normal. I had tried the Exfoliating Scrub later, since I hated to deal with the original "seven day" but soon went back to it as it truly works best. Now I always wear an SPF 45 on my face and stick with my Seven Day Scrub. 
I love Philosophy products but this shower gel smelled nothing like strawberries more like fluoride treatment for kids. I was really bummed out. Try the Cinnamon Buns it is so much better.
My sister-in-law bought this product for me after I had admired the shade (Purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. I have used other MAC products before with great results, but was VERY dissapointed with this product. First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  This product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, I would never reccomend this to anyone
I should have listen to the reviewer who said it smelled like "Lemon Pledge"...it really has a chemical smell and not pleasant at all.  I'm going to use it at the office to spray down the supply room
If you're really looking forward to brightening your blonde, go to the salon and ask for a non-ammonia hair lightening or use an OTC temporary product.  Chamomile would have to be used every day for months to really make a change in your color.  The expense of this product is not justified by the results, and while LUSH likes to toot its horn about being "natural", that designation could apply to arsenic.  It's pretty meaningless when combined with artificial preservatives on the top ten list for dangerous additives - the parabens
I have glorious white hair, and I thought this would be good for it.  But it seems to dry my hair too much, and frankly I don't see that it's any better than the two dollar bottle of Suave that's out there. I've also used Lush's BIG shampoo and Soak 'n' Float shampoo bars, and I like them much better.
 I was very excited to receive this product,yet my enthusiasm quickly turned to confusion.Call me foolish,but I thought perfume was to have a sweet,pleasant aroma{?. This pot had the distinct scent of a citronella {skeeter} candle...like the one I could smell burning from my neighbors yard last Summer!!!! I kept applying and re-applying it to "get a smell" from it...Not much luck. Maybe the spray perfume smells far better??? I do not understand how the founder says this perfume gets so many compliments!How? If I rubbed the bug candle wax on my wrists, I WOULD NOT have gals clammoring around me asking me what I was wearing!!!!I wore this a few times just to see the reactions.....Only 1 person said they could "sota" smell something! I tried Paris Hilton, and Britney's fantasy, and got TONS of compliments! Buy at your own discretion
I ordered the gift set and it came as advertised. Very cute package. Unfortunately no one sells this product on the east coast (that I could find) so I could not test it. It is far too strong a scent, even the lotion. The candle filled the house with the scent in 10 minutes. My advice, find someone or someplace that offers this product before purchasing
I have horrible bags and deep creases along edge of preorbital area. Of all the products I have tried, Olay Regenerist eye cream works the best. Also my plastic surgeon said that part of the dark purple is my muscle showing thru because I have excess skin but no fat in periorbital area. He said he will inject fat from my rear(plenty) and that will lessen the color, and after he removes excess skin, he will use laser
In all honesty, I'd rate the fragrance itself as "5 stars," however, the scent does not last for love nor money, which is why I give it a mere "1 star."  You'll find that you have to continuously apply it in order for anyone to compliment you on it and, consequently, before you know it, you've depleted your perfume!  Talk to anyone who has worn or even sells this fragrance and, if they're honest, they will tell you exactly what I've written here.  Because I adore the scent, I'm going to try the Baby Phat Goddess Body Lotion and see if that has a lingering effect
I purchased the Murad Acne Complex for $40 or so (for a measley one month supply).  I was disgustingly excited to try it, as everything else has failed me.  Proactiv works wonderfully for me, but only for the first month or two, then it seems I grow an immunity to it.I paid to have the Murad Acne Complex expedited to me because I was so anxious to get on to 'beautiful, clear skin.'  I read the pamphlet, and understood that my skin could go through a "purging" phase, where your skin literally purges all of the bacteria and other acne causing assailants.  Imagine the worst skin you've ever seen.  Imagine the most painful breakouts.  That was my personal "purging" process.  It was literally the worst breakout of my entire life.  My husband kept telling me to continue using the products though, because this was expected.  I'm STILL using the products, and though my skin is better than it was 3 weeks ago, I'm basically back where I was when I started.  I give up.  But I'm not giving up any more money to Murad
I had very high hopes for this cream, as it appears they went the extra mile for quality. Not so. The cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face, making for some tense moments that should not be there.I have used many creams. So far Art of Shaving is the best. Casswell Massey is ok as is Aveda. Avoid Truefitt.Update. Trufitt and Hill accepted the return and we spoke about the problems. They sent me a new updated extra fine version that should be available to the public now that is of the same quality as Massey. It is good. The standard is still substandard
I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more. And the contents were gross, very goopy. Not smooth. Like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. I'll fight the mall to buy this next time
If you have some respect for your nose, please don't buy these wipes!!! I bought these thinking that maybe it would have a nice soft smell, but these thing has more than enough perfume to stink your whole house!!! and I would never put it on the delicate skin of my baby
for medium length hair it lasted about 4 uses.  Smells way funky.  Can't say I noticed anything different.Just didn't feel that it warrants the hype
i got this bar based on the other reviews, and boy, is it strong! the bar will last a very good long while, unless you can actually stomach the smell of gallons of patchouli without getting a major headache. patchouli was originally supposed to be a base scent for other sweeter scents to sit upon. it was never supposed to be a stand-alone perfume! like all the LUSH bubble bars, this definitely packs the bubbles in a small amount. i just have buyers remorse because i now have this oversized bar (and it is a very big bar), and i can only use bits of it when my fiance is out of town because he gets an allergic reaction to the strong strong STRONG smell. i think the upside is that it seems like the scent isn't nearly so strong once you're actually *in* the bath. or maybe by then your olfactory senses are so overwhelmed you just can't tell the difference anymore.so yeah, if you love love LOOOOOOOOVE patchouli, then this is truly the bath bar for you. otherwise, i'd steer clear and go for something gentler. the hot milk bubble bar is the opposite of this bar, in that it's really gentle on the nose. and any of the jasmine flavored products would also be a better recommendation than this one.i love LUSH, but not this bar
I tried reading this book but found it so turgid and poorly written that I put it down in frustration.  It reads like a translation from another language by an academic bureacrat. The theme is interesting, the execution poor.  Cannot recommend
Let me see how many books can I write to preach to the choir about the same thing. She must of got dumped by a handful of Liberal boyfriends (what intellegent person would want her) and now she's trying to get back at 'em. Can't wait for the next "I hate liberals so much and here are my reasons why" book. She should join Fox she would fit right in
This is an overwritten and overhyped piece of fiction that will never pass for great literature. It is timely but it is not timeless.  Not one character comes alive even though they all talk endlessly. Not one scene is memorable. The true nature of the book -- soap opera-- is cloaked under its many pages.   Messud is a good writer who in this instance could not tell a good story, and she seems to have believed her publicity machine.  I can't believe that her husband, who a great literary critic, would not talk her out of publishing this.  Oh.  I forgot.  Money and fame trumps quality every time.
I had somewhat forgotten how Greg Bear wrote.  His descriptions of the  Jart are so obscure and long-winded, the reader may as well just turn the  page.  I found it annoying that Greg Bear attempted to invent even more  words in this book than Eon.  My largest complaint however resided in the  high number of typos, duplicated words, letters dropped etc that made the  reading even more disruptive.  It really looked like there had been global  replacements as the same errors were repeated.  While I'd admit that an  author is more concerned with flow, plot, and technical accuracy - the  editor should review with a little more care to the fundamentals
When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt.  But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog.  Long, boring, and confusing.  I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them.  It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  What a waste.  What a shame.
I have read all of Sandra Brown books.I was disappointed in this one. I havealmost all of her books in my bookcase,but when I finished this one I gave itaway. 
I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character.
I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries, with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers.  I wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't given up on her.  Now I'm not so sure.  This latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring.  Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out.  I wish I could say that I would read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat convoluted story, I would think twice.  If I did pick up another Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick with it to the end.
This book was great.  I especialy liked the chapter where Bill sticks a falafel in his co-worker's hoo-hah.  Priceless
check out page 67 of the book for a basic reason why this book is useless:an entire page of a ftp session downloading openldap.  huh?  How is this helpful?  getting the right version of BerkeleyDB and installing it, or installing and configuring OpenSSL would have been far more helpful to me.This is another book composed mostly of cut 'n paste from the man pages, header files and varous scripts you can find with google.Discussion on basic topics such as replication skips over key steps, examples for many issues are not provided or are hidden in the book.  I use LDAP at work and I used the O'Reilly book to instal, configure and use OpenLDAP.  I have yet to find a question that Deploying OpenLDAP can answer that I can't get faster with google
I have loved many of Jodi Picoult's other books, but this one seemed too far-fetched. I did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in-fact detracted from it.  Many of my friends who are Jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release
I recently read Robert Monroe's first book, "Journeys Out of Body" and found it to be a disappointment - it was just weird. As I noted in my review of that book, I had hoped that the author would discuss his use of sound, for which he is allegedly noted. As I purchased this book at the same time and had nothing else to read, I thought I'd give it a try. The book did start out with a brief discussion of some of his "research" and I thought that, perhaps, this book might actually have some real substance. That belief; however, quickly disappeared. By the time I had reached the half-way point in the book, nothing remained but a schizophrenic quagmire of incomprehensible gibberish. How does total garbage like this manage to get printed?!There are those that claim that Monroe was a highly left-brained individual who delved into the realm of the creative right-brain. If this book is any indication, one can't help but wonder if Monroe was missing his entire left hemisphere! There is nothing logical or, for that matter, even coherent in the babble spewed across the endless pages of this book. It would have been worthwhile if Monroe had actually described his experiments and resulting data in a scientific manner. Instead, he chose to spew his incoherent ramblings about his own, personal, dream experiences: these wander so aimlessly, from paragraph to paragraph, that one can't help but wonder what real point, if any, he was trying to make.The really sad thing is that I had really hoped to find a genuinely scientific study of his work - I was actually quite interested in the topic. Having now been subjected to two of his useless books, I'm amazed that they're still in print. This is pseudo-science at its absolute worst.
I am not a student.  I wanted to read The Great Gatsby but I had no one with whom I could discuss the story.  I decided in a momentary lapse of judgment to supplement my reading with the Cliffs Notes.  Unfortunately, it was full of grammatical errors and what I found to be very superficial commentaries
Despite the fact that Hanegraaff's name is the bigger of the two on the front cover, only the first 40 pages of this very small book are worth reading, and they are the writing of Paul Maier.  His research is helpful, but so limited in scope that you wonder if he wasn't given a week-end to write it and come up with as much as he could.  Every topic needs futher information.  A lot more could be said, and Maier seems to be the kind of scholar who could have done a lot more.Hanegraaff contributes 29 pages of defense of the historical Jesus which is an even more surface-level reworking of information covered much better elsewhere.That said, I would give this book to someone who isn't much of a reader but for whom The Da Vinci Code has raised some questions.  It isn't much more than a collection of scattered soundbites, but that may have been a good marketing strategy when there is already such a proliferation of secondary literature on what was only a piece of pulp fiction
``People  say again and again that philosophy  doesn't really progress, that we  arestill occupied  with the same philosophical problems as were  theGreeks.But  the people who say this don't understand why ishas to be  so. It is becauseour language has remained the same and  keeps seducing us  into asking the same questions.  As longas there continues to be a verb  'to be' that  looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to eat' and  'to  drink', as long as we stillhavethe adjectives  'identical', 'true',  'false', 'possible',as  long as we continueto talk of a river of time, of  an expanseof  space, etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties and find themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no explanation seems capable of clearing up.And what'smore,this  satisfies  a longing for the transcendent, because, insofar  as peoplethinkthey can  see `the limits of human  understanding', theybelieve of course thatthey  can see  beyond these.`` ''Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of ourintelligence by means of language````Ambition is the death of  thought'''These three quotes are from Ludwig Wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago (but most people have yet to find this out).Dennett, though he has  been a philosopher for some40 years, is one them. It is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist, John Searle, studied under famous Wittgensteinians (Searle with John Austin, Dennett with Gilbert Ryle) but Searle got the point and Dennett did not. Dennett is a hard determinist(though he trys to sneak  reality in the back door), and perhaps this is due to Ryle, whose famous book 'The Concept of Mind'(1949) continues to be reprinted.  That book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine.  Dennett enjoys  making  the mistakes Wittgenstein, Ryle(andmany others since) have exposed in detail. Byaccident,just before this book, I had  read ''The Minds I'', which Dennett coauthored withDouglas Hofstadter in 1981. They made some bad  mistakes(see my review), and saddest of all, they reprinted  twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess---Nagel's `What is  like to be a bat?` and an early version of John  Searle's Chinese Room argument explaining why computers  don't think. Nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat's mind would be  like.  Searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize  thinking  and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does(eg,it can translate Chinese  without understanding it). Likewise, we lack a clear test for recognizing  what countsas good  vs bad--or just intelligible-- for many philosophical and scientific concepts. Our  use of the words consciousness, choice, freedom, intention,  particle, thinking, determines, wave,cause, happened,  event(and so on endlessly) are  rarely a source of confusion  but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy(and anydiscussion detached from the environment  in  which language evolved) chaos reigns. Wittgenstein  was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid  this. Unfortunately, he died inhis prime, his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of  how the mind(language)  worksand he never wroteany popular books,  so  understanding of his work is restricted to a very few. Searle  is one of the world's leadingphilosophers and has written  manyextremely clear  and highly regarded articles and books,some of which have pointed out the  glaring defects in Dennett'swork.His review ``Consciousness Explained  Away'' of Dennetts 1991 book`'Consciousness Explained'' and his book''The Mystery of Consciousness'' are very well  known,and show, in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing,why neither Dennett(nor any of the  hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic)havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem--ie, how do you conceptualizeconsciousness.Many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things, but it isclear that we are  nowhere near it now. Dennett has mostly  ignored his critics but has favored  Searle with vituperative personal attacks.Searle has been accused by Dennett and others of  being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is(mostly) a branch of cognitive psychology and Searle has made it very clear for 30 years that WE are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious, thinks, etc,.  He just points out that we don't have any idea how this happens.   Searle characterizes as ''intellectualpathology'',the views ofDennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain. Dennett repeats his  mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of  the book, where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how! Unsurprisingly, there isnot one reference toWittgenstein or Searle in theentire book.There arehowever, many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is. Like most people, it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo  certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite  unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the  world. They are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago.Wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30's, and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with. Dennett says(p98)that  his view is compatibilism, ie, that  free will(whichI hopewe can equate with choice) is compatible with  determinism(ie, that''there is at any instant exactly one physically  possible  future''--p25). He wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. However, the whole book is smoke  and mirrors by means of  which choice, in the sense we normally  understand it, disappears and we are  left with ``choice``,  which is something we cannot choose. Naturally, this  echoes  the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ``Consciousness  Explained``. It is remarkable that, at a time when we are  just beginning to  reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a  single neuron works(or how an  atom works for that matter), that anyone should  think they can  make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain  its most complex phenomena. Please recall the last sentence of Wittgenstein  from the opening quote: ''And what'smore,this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent, because, insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see `the limits of  human understanding',theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond  these.`` The  relation between language, thought and reality is  extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. If one is very, very  careful,some understanding is possible, but Dennett throws caution to  the  winds and we are dragged into the quicksand. There are  at least 3 different  topics here(evolution of our brain, choice  and morality) and Dennett tries  vainly to weld them together into  a coherent account of how freedom evolves  from the deterministic  crashing of atoms. There is, however, no compelling  reason to  accept that bouncing atoms (or his favorite example, the game  of  life running on a computer) are isomorphic with reality.  He knows that  quantum indeterminacy(or the uncertainty principle)  is a major obstacle to  determinism however defined(and has  been taken by many as an escape to  freedom) but dismisses  it due to the fact that such events are too rare to  bother  with. By extension, its unlikely that any such  event will happen now or even in our  whole lifetime in our  brain, so we appear to be stuck with a determined  brain(whatever  that may be). However, the universe is a big place and its been  around a long time(perhaps forever) and if even one such quantum  effect occurs  it would seem to throw the whole universe into  an indeterminate state. The  notion ''there is at any  instant exactly one physically possible future''  cannot be true  if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur--in this  case  there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. This  recalls  one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics--each  instant our  universe is branching into infinitely many universes. He correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice.  This obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness(or any other emergent phenomenon).  If so, they will definitely win at least one Nobel Prize, for not only will they have explained consciousness, they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence(how higher order properties emerge from lower ones). So, they would have to solve the 'easy' problem(to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty) and the 'hard' one(what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc?). And while they are at it how about also doing the  impossible--an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain.  It is very well known that these equations are uncomputable, even for one atom or a vacuum, as it would require an infinite amount of computer time.  But infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer. He starts off on the  first page appealing to the laws of  physics for protection against fantastic  notions such as immaterial souls, but physics is made of notions just as  fantastic(uncertainty,  entanglement, wave/particle duality, Schrodinger's  dead/alivecat etc) and as Feynmann said many times ``Nobody understandsphysics!'' Many think nobody ever will. On pg  2 he says  our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and  on pg 2  to3 that our personality differences are due to how  our ''robotic teams are  put togther, over a lifetime of  growth and experience.`` This is a bald  dismissal of human  nature, of the abundant evidence that our differences are  to  a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early  childhood, and  is typical of his constant confused wandering  back and forth between  determinism and environmentalism.On page  9 he notes that free will is a problem and our  attitudes to  it make a difference, but for whom? Nobody but philosophers. We make choices. What's the problem?  One has to step  outside life to experience a problem and then  everything becomes a problem.  What are consciousness, pain,  yellow, intention, matter, quarks, gravity  etc.? I doubt that  anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their  interactions  with people or their decision making processes due to their  thinking about choice. This shows that there is something  strange about such questions. Wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are  different. There are games  for language connected with the cognitive  templates for decisions  or seeing colors etc, and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. Decoupled modes permit  thinking about the past, planning for the future, guessing  the mental states  of others, etc, but if one takes the results  in the wrong way and starts to  think `'John will try to steal  my wallet'', rather than just imagining that  John might  do it, confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled  mode or distinguish it from coupled mode,  enter the realm of pathology. Some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be  seen this way--they lose control of which mode they are in, eg, notbeing able to see the  difference between the motives people  have and the motives they might have. One can then see  much of the philosophizing people do as operating in  these  decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them  the  differences from the normal mode. Normal mode--eg, what  is that lion doing--  was undoubtedly the first one evolved  and decoupled modes--what did that lion  do last time or what  does he intend to do next--evolved later. This was  probably  never a problem for animals--any animal that spent too much  time  worrying about what might happen would not be very successful  contributing to  the gene pool. It is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed  culture and began degeneratinggenetically, could large numbers of people  survive with genes that  led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes.  Hence, we  have philosophy and this book, which is mostly about running the  decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real  consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results  in a book for other people to  use to run their engines in decoupled mode.' Let us alter Wittgenstein's quote to read:  ''As longas there continues to be a verb 'to decide'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to  eat' and 'to  drink',as long as we continueto talk of  freedom of action, of saying I  wish I had done otherwise,  etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no  explanation seems capable of clearing up.''As withmost philosophy books, nearly every page, often every paragraph,  changes from one type of language  game to another without  noticing that now one would have to be joking or  dreaming  or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc, and not actually  intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the  world. On page  10 he says we count on free will for the  whole way of thinking about our lives,  like we count on food  and water, but who ever, outside philosophy, standing in  front  of lunch counter full of food, ever thinks how fine it is that  they  have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral  water? Even if I  want to be a serious compatibilist and  try thinking this in decoupled mode, I  have to exit and  enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. Only then  can I go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have  happened if I had  not had the ability to make a real choice.  Wittgenstein noted how pretend  games are parasitic on real ones(this is not a trivial observation!).  The ability to engage in very complex  decoupled scenarios  is already evident in 4 year old children. So I would say  that normally, nobody counts on having choice, but rather we just choose. On the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive  basics.  He says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual  atmosphere of choice,  and that `'It appears to be a stable  and ahistorical construct, as eternal  and unchanging as arithmetic,  but it is not.'' And on page 13--''It is an  evolved creation  of human activity and beliefs''. The whole thrust of  cognitive  psychology is that we do NOT learn the basics of planning, deciding,  promising, resenting, etc, but that these are built-in functions  of the  inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously  and start running  in very early childhood. There is no evidence  that they change as we grow,  or are in any way subject to  our beliefs,only  that they mature just as our body does. On pg 14 he suggests  its probable that our having free will depends on our believing  we have  it!  Do we believe we see an apple, feel a pain, are  happy? The language  game of belief is very different from  that of knowing. We can believe we have  a dollar in our  pocket but if we take it out and look at it we can't  meaningfully  then say that we still believe it(except as a joke etc.). The  inference engine can run in decoupled(belief) mode so we can  imagine havingchoices or making them, but in life we just make them and it is only in very  odd situations we can say  that we believe we made a choice. But Dennett is  saying thisis the universal case. If making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else--consciousness,  seeing,  thinking,etc. If we take this seriously(and he says 'the serious problems of  free will' ) then we are getting  into trouble and if we actually try to apply  it to life, then madness is minutes away. . On page 65 et seq., he  discusses causation, intention and the `informal predicates'  that we use to  describe atoms etc, but cognitive resarch has  shown that we describe all  objects with a limited number of  ontological categories which we analyse with  our intuitive physics  modules and that when agents (ie animals or people or  things  like them--ie, ghosts or gods) are involved we use our  concepts (engines)  for agency, intuitive psychology, social minds, etc to  decide  how to behave. There is almost certainly no causation module  but  rather it will involve all of these and other inference  engines, depending on  the precise situation. Discussing  possibility and necessity is much  easier if  one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive  physics,  agency, ontological categories etc. Of course there is no mention  here of Wittgenstein's many incisive comments on causation,  intention,  deciding, nor of Searle's now classic works  on Intention and Social Reality. He spends much time on  Ainslie's book 'Breakdown of Will', in which is  discussed  the hyperbolic discounting faculties (ie, inference engines) by which  we evaluate probable outcomes.Hemakes much of the excellent work of Robert Frank on altruism, emotion and economics, but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published. It was Bingham's idea, amplified by Frank and by Boyd and Richardson (1992) that  cooperation  was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. He suggests these as examples of Darwinian approaches  that areobligatory and promising. Indeed they are, and  in fact they are standard  parts of economic, evolutionary  and cognitive theory, but unfortunately, he  makes little reference  to the other work in these fields. All that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them. He does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice. Onpg 216 he says that making oneself so  that one could not have  done otherwise is a key innovation in  the evolutionary ascent to free will,  and that we can only  be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive  to  opportunities. But where this ability resides is not revealed  for  several chapters! Dennett has a penchant for hiding  his ideas in a massive  amount of rather irrelevant text.  Again, he gets things backwards, as there is  a vast body of  very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get  the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and  these are not provided by some part of our conscious  self, but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the  engines. As he notes, hundreds of experiments  with the Prisoner's Dilemma  and related protocols have shown how easy it is to  manipulate  people's choices and that their calculations are not conscious  and  deliberate at all. When the situation is manipulated to  make them conscious,they are much slower and  less reliable. So, there has been  constant pressure of natural  selection to make the engines fast and automatic  and inacessible  to deliberate thought.Dennett says `we make ourselves'  so  that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis  of morality and  choice. The evidence would seem to be exactly  the opposite. Our inference engines give  us basic moral intuitions and  we generally act in accord with the results.  If we or others  do not we feel guilt, outrage, resentment etc, then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.Our genes make us so we can't(mostly) do otherwise, not our will or whatever Dennett thinks can do it.   We can often choose to do otherwise but our own  intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval  usually serve to limit our choices. These intuitions evolved  in small groups between 50,000 and some  millions of years ago. In the modern world the intuitions are often not to  our  advantage and the social controls weak. This is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world.On pg  225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will  as ''a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making(from certain angles)''. He claims that thisplays all the valuable  roles of free will but lacks some  (unspecified) properties possessed by  traditional free will.  The smoke is thick but I  am pretty  sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice. He insists(top pg 226) that his naturalistic  account of decision  making leaves plenty of room for moral  responsibility, but making ourselves so  we couldn't do otherwise  does not seem to describe the way we actually  function, nor  does it seem to leave any room for morality, as that would seem  to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise. He  does not propose  any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary  or forced and I doubt he could  do so. Normally if someone  asks us to move our hand, we know what counts as  having a  choice, but, typical of philosophers, I expect that regardless  of  whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position. At this point he also starts his discussion of Libet's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that I felt was worth my time. On page 253 et seq., he sneaks in his definition of conscious will--the  ''brains user illusion  of itself''' which has as one of its main roles  providing  ''me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times``.  And ``Illusory or not, conscious will is the persons guide  to his or her own  moral responsibility for action.`` He says  the trick we need is to see that  ``I`' control what is happening  inside the ''simplification barrier''...  ''where decision  making happens''. ``Mental events'' become conscious by  ''entering  into memory''. ''The process of self description... is  what we  are''. The crucial thing is that choice is possible  because the self is  distributed over space(the brain) and time(memories).  He realizes this is  going to leave many incredulous(everyone who can follow this and really understands!). ''I know that many  people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously. It seems to them  to be a trickwith mirrors, some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness, and the real Self , out of the picture just when it was about to  be introduced.'' Many will say he took the words out of their mouth, but I would  say it's incoherent and  thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole  universe(making the obvious extensions of such claims)  was gone long beforewegot this far. On pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals!  This is a stunning denial of human nature(ie, genetics and evolution) coming from the person who wrote 'Darwin's Dangerous Idea''!  Presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space(the brain and other people) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness(line 6 from bottom).  He says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain(you will have to suffer through 'Consciousness Explained to find that there is no answer there either).  Though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology, he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades(social mind, intuitive psychology, coalitional intuitions etc) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts. If he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture, thats ok, but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes.  We are also told here that R&D(by which he means evolution here, but other things elsewhere) has given us the self  and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality.  I am sure that he will get little agreement on this.  It seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates(and earlier) long before spoken language(though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain).  He continues ``morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago`` which would be OK if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake!  And then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes, which is an amazing (and totally incorrect)thing to say, even if he was only referring to memes.  On pg 260 he claims  that  because we do not comprehend our ''bland dispositions  to cooperate'', they  mean nothing to us, but it is the operation  of our templates that is  everything to us. There is ample  evidence that if one of them is damaged a  person cannot function  properly as a social being(eg, autism).  I would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead Dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think.  He also says here that it was one of the major  evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them. This again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology.  I know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions, like all the templates, are accessible to consciousness.  We may decide our cheating was justifiable, or forgive someone else's cheating, but we still know it was cheating(ie, we cannot change the engine). I suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings.  Another issue is that as culture developed, one had to make many important or 'moral type` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer.  On pg 267 he says that we now replace our `free floating rationales'(probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines) with reflection and mutual persuasion. And on pg 286 he says that it is a child's upbringing --demanding and giving reasons-- that affects moral reasoning. Again, he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research--the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing. We are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self, which takes responsibility.  It is not any more coherent or credible with repetition.  On pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education(memory) and sharing.  It's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments. On pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between 'ought'and 'is' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago--ie, they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people.  He also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes(eg see 'The Blank Slate'). He often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology, but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion.  This happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like 'praiseworthy' were shaped over millennia by culture, while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms.   On pg 262 he tries to explain how an ESS(Evolutionarily Stable Strategy) can produce morality. His idea here is that genetic `R&D` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture(memetics) produces variations and clarifications.  I would say that we all know, and much research has made clear, that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases.  Culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings.  The last part of the book is mostly  concerned  with moral culpability. He refers to the legal classic by Hart  and  Honore, which I started reading 30 years ago since it's  authors were deeply influenced by Wittgenstein.  Dennett tells us that we have  control over our own morality and  that thinking about morality will improve us.  But, there seems  no justification whatever for this view in this book. There is nothing at  all  here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. It is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that  has no connection with philosophy- and there is not a hint of  spirituality in this entire book--another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. I find  more wisdom about how  to be free and moral in any of Osho's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy. One rarely finds spiritually and morally  advanced people teaching at universities. There is no sign here, nor in  anything he has done, that Dennett is morally superior. After 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them.  It seems clear that, like all of us, he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines. So, how much opportunity is there to  improve our morality? It seems  clear(eg, see Pinker's `The Blank Slate`) that  most of our behaviour  is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our  environment, in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties. On  average, maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior(variations are the only thing we can  study) is due to our own efforts. The moral choices that matter  most today are  those affecting the fate of the world. But our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect. How remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is.  And if one did, we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fMRI  equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc.  But a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking, coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is!  And then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first.  To return to the quote at the beginning--'Ambition is the death of thought'.  Indeed--though clearly Wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts
This books starts with such promise but I find it hard to believe that the people who wrote the glowing reviews were actually able to slog through it! Minutiae-fest
Maybe I am not smart enough for this book, it certainly isn't for the novice!!I ended up more confused than educated
I'm really disappointed in this book, because the author seems to imply that you can have ANYTHING you want, but that is just not the case.  It's a deceptive title.  I can honestly say that this book is worthless and is not going to help you; you're better off practising Feng Shui and hanging little crystals in your house than reading this book (and I'm not knocking Feng Shui, I practise it myself).  People like the author of this book just want to make a quick buck at your expense.  In the end, you'll just feel worse off, looking for the "next big thing" to promise you some more snake oil.Another fact I'd like to point out is that this author sells this book in CD format for around $60.00 (I got a flyer in the mail).  If he is truly living life according to his principles why would he even charge for these so-called "secrets," doesn't that go against his own moral values?  One of the gimmicks of the CDs is that you can learn the secret sound of "creation," as if chanting "Ahhhh" is going to make everything alright.  Thanks to Dyer and others like him, I am completely against any sort of "positive thinking" Guru.  They are only after YOUR money (while you keep wishing you had more).*Btw, you might be interested to know that after reading this book, you're only going to find out that the BIG CATCH is that Manifesting Your Destiny, according to the author, ONLY applies to spiritual matters.  Huh?  Yes.  The entire book promises you can have anything you want, but it has absolutely nothing to do with material prosperity.  The author also wants you to know that if your desire is not in accordance with "God's" plan, you don't have a chance either.  Thought I'd mention that before you read this book and end up feeling cheated!
This is not a book I would recomend for anyone serious interested in rune casting. It tells nothing of the history of runes and it seems if the writer figured out what tarot card closely matches each rune and then wrote the book based off that info. There are much better books out there for rune casting
This collection of poems, tho representing a fine breadth of Dickenson's works, is in final assessment a crime against the poet's great talent.  As is freely admitted in the introduction, the editor, Mr. Higginson, &quot;worked on the mechanics of the poems by smoothing out the rhymes and meter, changing the line arrangements, and rewriting the dialect of the local area.&quot;  This is a free admission of the book's guilt, having adulterated Dickenson's original poems in both content and form.  Gone are the nuances and passions that make Dickenson one of the best American writers.  Gone are the premeditated dashed and capitalizations that add depth and intensity to the poems' meanings.  And, worst of all, gone or altered are many lines that contribute to the unique vision of the artist.  As Thomas H. Johnson says in the Introduction to &quot;The Complete Poems of Emily Dickenson,&quot; A representative mid-nineteenth century traditionalist was being asked to judge the work of a wholly new order of craftsman . . . which he was not equipped to estimate.&quot;  Do yourself a favor and avoid this text.  Instead, find one that is true to the original poems, one which preserves the intent and stylistic genius of the author, and one which will give you the full and lasting effect of Emily Dickenson
If you are looking for a "feel good" book about baby boomer retirement, this book may have some value for you. But if you are looking for specific in-depth how-to, this book isn't the answer. Each segment-work, dreams, travel-is short and doesn't address many relevant issues.For example, regarding the work chapter, the author postulates that there will be a work shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap. Well, that is speculative with globalism. Those jobs may be outsourced. Most are low paying. Many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining. Yes, there may be Wal-Mart jobs but is this your retirement dream? The work chapter sounds a lot like most "Do what you love" books. But doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish needed income. These and other issues facing boomers who want meaningful work into their 70s are not addressed. I could pick apart other chapters in the same manner
Seems amidst the turbulence and brouhaha of that James Frey fiasco, anybody who now pens their auto-bios have to first be as famous and beloved as Billy Crystal.  But then they can only put out the cotton-candy Coney Island fluff as '700 Sundays' is.  Granted, the book is based on Crystal's highly-praised Tony Award winning theatrical performance about time with his father and relatives when growing up during the 50s et al.  But it's nothing more than an appetizer to fill in and/or tide one over during the day and night Kaddish.  Yet in ripping a page out of Billy's book, it's not hard to imagine how that rapid-fire exchange between him and his agent went.  It probably went something like: "Hey, bubby, how about writing a book talking about your 700 Sundays with your pop?""Well, I'm not a writer per se.  I just jot down a few notes here and there, and then go out and perform the material on stage.""So here's a few blank pages of paper; write down what you have.""It'll only be 45 maybe 50 pages at most; and it sounds and looks much better than it reads.""Don't worry, bubby, I know people who know people who...you get the idea...at the publishers.  Here's their recipe: They'll take your 50 wholesale pages and spread `em out across 180 retail pages.  'How?' may you ask!  Well, they'll cut `em in half, then cut `em in half again.  And using big ink letters so even grandmas can read it without their glasses; surround it by a whole lot of white space; toss in some pictures at different angles from your family album -- Slap it all together between two hardcovers...It'll be just fine.""Yes, but...""Don't worry.  Consider it like a vintage bottle of Mogen David 20/20 wine, aged a few months before it makes it to the shelves of your favorite corner liquor store hangout.  In this case, the local bookstores.  Oh, and make sure you give `em just enough to whet their taste buds; leave `em wanting more and thirsty for more.  People'll drink it up.""Yes, but...""Don't worry, Face.  Everybody loves ya.  Just toss in a few tidbits from your routines about Satchmo and Mantle, you'll be all right.  Don't forget now, we've got the sequels all lined up for ya too. Y'know `700 Mondays;' then `700 Tuesdays' and so on.  Yes'sir, I can see it all now:  We've got the lock on all those 700 days of the week shtick.  Oh, and we'll do some holiday editions too, starting with `700 Hanukkahs!'"You're still friends with that kid, Adam Sandler, back from your SNL days, aren't ya?!  Yes, so we'll get you and him together to come up with new lyrics to that Hanukkah song of his.  It'll be a great collaboration.  It's good to pass down the ladder to them other kids climbing up once you've made it. Y'know God blesses and doesn't forget those things by them who do.  Yes, ok, so we'll go ahead from there and do `700 Passovers!'"And it'll be an annual event too, dont'cha know.  Just think, when people see Chuck Heston...may God keep a special place in heaven for him...when people see Chuck Heston and The Ten Commandments, they'll be thinking about you too, Billy.  Yes'sir, we'll have em crying and laughing every year on Passover, you'll see."Oh, and holy of holies, out of the deal we'll get `700 Yom Kippurs!'   You'll see.  But this will be only for our people, Billy, you understand.  So you might have to dig deep to get material for it.  But that's what authors do, they dig deep.  But you already knew that, right?  Can you dig it, man?  I knew that you could."Yes, but...""Don't worry, Face, everybody loves ya!  Your books don't have to be earth-shattering or thought-provoking or anything like that.  But hey listen, with a book deal, a books-on-tape deal, and who knows even a movie deal, we'll turn your little leaden bits into golden nuggets.  Mark my words we will. "And say, since you haven't had a hit movie in awhile...no offense...we're going to get Martin Scorsese to produce and direct your life story.  Yes, it'll be something like 'Pinch Me I'm Still Jewish: The Billy Crystal Story' in widescreen and all that jazz.  It's what everybody in Hollywood's doing right now.  Yeah, no use waiting until your dying or dead already, Billy - God forbid.  No, siree, bubby!!  "So Scorsese will do the movie on the cheap, because God knows the man deserves an Oscar already.  You know it, I know it, we all know it, Billy.  And not just an honorary or lifetime achievement either, but the really big one, see!  And just imagine, wouldn't it be something if you were hosting the awards ceremony and handed Marty his own Oscar?!  Yes, well, we can schmooze on about all this stuff later."But for now, with the books and everything, you'll be a one-man franchise, yes you will!  You'll be on the New York Times Best Seller List from now until forever!  It'll be great!!""Yes, but...""Oh and well, I didn't want to say anything just yet, but, okay, here goes: There might be plans to expand everything too!  Listen, bubby, I know somebody who knows somebody who...you get the idea...over at the networks.  "We can do a little Chris Rock in the neighborhood sort of thing.

I have no personal experience with 12-step programs nor do I have dominant addictions (other than book and DVD buying!) but I am a psychologist who has seen a lot of people and their stories and regularly deals with smoking, over-eating and love addictions in particular. I was hoping for some new ideas to assist clients.This book takes a rational-emotive type approach to conquering addiction and on that level is fine for those wanting to look at that approach. I also found some of his reference to research of how people recover also quite useful BUT he seems to have quite a personal, and often over-generalised, attacking crusade against 12-step programs. Some of his concerns about possible problems and misunderstandings many people can have with 12-step programs were valid and useful. Similarly I welcomed his questioning of the disease model that has people always defining themselves as an addict and powerless.However he has to keep coming back in every chapter to go over and over the evils he sees in 12-step programs  - and in very derogatory judgmental language. He often even implies they are all deliberately manipulating and exploiting people. I got very uncomfortable with his imputing these motives to everyone.There appear to be many genuine people of good intention in these movements (and many who clearly seems to get a lot out of them and have recovered). I would have rather he had used his own rational methods rather than resort to such abusive  language. He could have suggested modified views and tools, and alternatives to consider. I can't imagine that he would lure anyone away from the 12-step programs he criticises by attacking everything they have been standing for. However a gentler exploration of limitations and evidence and suggestions for alternatives may have opened up a welcomed middle ground
This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.  I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup. The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book. 
If you think you'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting, then you'll enjoy this book.
An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal
I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did

Look, the fact is feminism is about CHOICE no more, no less. I have the highest respect for stay at home moms--it is the hardest darn job on Earth. But this woman is WAY off base to say that feminism sold us a lie. Feminism GAVE us a choice. It told us we did not HAVE to pretend to believe we were June Cleaver if that was not what was in our hearts and souls. Personally, I could not have children and ONLY feminists have not made me feel like an alien species. I work with troubled teens, my skills do not go to waste, I spoil my nieces and nephews--I am fulfilled and happy. My sister is a stay at home mom with three beautiful boys, she is fulfilled and happy,FEMINISM gave us those choices, ladies. We were not "sold" ANYTHING, we were given much by the women who burned their bras before us. IF you feel belittled by staying home with your children and doing the world's most important job, I think that is YOUR issue and not NOW's. Stop blaming feminism for YOUR insecurities, if you are feminist--stop blaming your mother for your insecurities--you have choices BECAUSE of FEMINISM not despite it!
No one alive today cares that NY had fires in 1741 (UNLIKE THE CHICAGO fIRE OF 1871). Why did author Lepore choose to bring up this terrible racial incident. Is she trying to create trouble? Be a traitor to her own race? Book is well researched I guessbut the racial subject matter stinks and was unnecessary to bring up! Totally unnecessary!
I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it
I bought this book this weekend as we're doing the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don't much like it. I've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if I need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality. In the end, I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a message about love as much as 'I own you'. I like 'Mama Do You Love Me?' better for explaining to a child a parent's unconditional love.'Good-Night Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown, however, is by far my children's all time favorite book. I was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed. They love it and so do we as parents. But this one even creeped my hubby out and he's from a fairly 'normal' family.Take it w/a grain of salt
Robert Allen's previous book, Multiple Streams of Income, is EXCELLENT and I can't say enough good things about it.  This one was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT in comparison.  He talks about the same rehashed Internet marketing strategies that everyone else does.  Creating email lists, newsletters, blah, blah, blah...The most disappointing thing about Robert Allen -- and I lost so much respect for him over this -- is that he demonstrates how to get a bunch of people to order his product within minutes of putting out an email blast.  What's stupid about the whole thing, and demonstrates that he's a snakeoil salesman scam artist, is that what he's selling by email is a course on how to make money on the Internet...so how do you make money on the Internet?  According to Robert Allen, by selling courses showing people how to make money on the Internet is the only way to make money on the Internet.  That's a scam!  How does he sleep at night?Don't buy this book.  It's a waste of money
I bought this book because I was looking for some alternatives to PB&J.  Both of my children are now attending peanut-free/tree-nut free schools.  This book has lots of ideas, but too many of them are variations of the peanut butter sandwich. 
I have read a bunch of poker books and play regularly.  There are a lot of good books out there, Dan Harrington's the very best, but this isnt one of them.  Too much ego here and not enough helpful information
I was not impressed with this book.  It's worth reading only because there are so few Ruby on Rails books.  There is too much basic Ruby and not enough Rails in this book.  I much prefered the Agile Web Dev with Rails
Mr. Shirley sneaks into Iran, hiding in the box of a truck, where he should have stayed.  He spends 3 or 4 days in Iran, most of it trying not to be seen.  He walks around for a few hours. He speaks to 3 or 4  truckdrivers, 2 or 3 shopkeepers, and a few assorted others, from which he  assembles a complete picture and understanding of the Political and Social  infrastructure of Iran.  Along the way he explains, on just about every  other page, how the CIA is a complete failure in every facet of it's  existence, how all the career people in it's employ are arrogant idiots who  are devoid of all compassion and intellect.  He explains each of the Cia's  mistakes, along with his explanation of what they ought to have done. He  is, of course, ex CIA himself, having left it because no one there  understood anything about anything
The content of this book is adequate, but the layout leaves much to be desired.  The only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents.  Pages are not labeled with chapter information, such as which chapter that page belongs to.  The content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half. This makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book.  You can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused.  If the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book, I would rate it much higher
Not to be disrespectful but are you people for real? I can't believe this book is getting 4 and 5 stars. There was nothing good about this book. A bunch of people in the book did not even matter, Bill Kendall's wife, the new anchor man Pete whatever his last name was, the boss Yelena, Eliza's boyfriend, the priest, even the soon-to-be-president and his wife, I mean what's the point in even mentioning them? They were not involved in the main events. She didn't even talk about what happened to them at the end. The judge is the only one that matters, and she didn't even write about him all that much. Really disappointing. As I said I don't mean to be disrespectful, but to give this book 5stars, you must have read either bedtime stories all your life, or not have read anything. DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY that's all i have to say. sorr
My husband is Icelandic, and unfortunately this book was NO help at all... It's perfectly fine for the traveller, but in trying to live everyday life, conversing with new family members forget it. I would have liked to have seen a more comprehensive grammatical section, something that was laid out in something easy to look at and understand. If you are quite serious about learning this language I would honestly recommend saving the 20 bucks and buying the bit more expensive Colloquial Icelandic.  For me at least, it's quite easier to understand, has complete grammatical charts in the back, as well as a fairly decent dictionary...  Again, if you are only learning for business trips and such, then this would be a good option... For those of us actually moving there, her book is not so good..
I was reading about my son.  It all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense.  Really talked about a framework of letting the decision making (and the consequence of their decision) remain with the teen. Then half way the book screeched in a new direction.  All of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view.  When it comes to sex the authors don't want you to leave the decision with the teens, they want to take that one back, which weakens the premise they present.The authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm position - which I would have respected, if not agreed with.  Then in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes Christ into the conversation/solution.  If I knew this book was written in context of a particular belief system, I wouldn't have spent the $22.  I would have wanted to know that in advance.  Tripping over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished the content and message of this book.Buyer Bewar
I tried as hard as I could but just could not get into this book.  Not quite as bad as her book, "Impossible," but close.  Danielle Steel is getting so repetitive in her writing.  Basically, this book repeated over and over how much Quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he didn't realize how much she meant to him until she was dying/dead.  Drivel.  She could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves, but no.  A waste of time.  Very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all.  Disappointing, to say the least. 
Cruel, horrible story with a typical Barr convoluted plot. The abuse of children, evil ranger poising as a dead ranger, freaky religious sect, dead animals on the bed, and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me. I've read many Barr books, and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters, it's hard to keep them straight. In this book, that was the last of my worries. I didn't even finish it, I was so turned off
This was a hot mess, it was so boring I couldn't even finish the book, I passed it on to my cusion, and she said the same thing, I just gave the book away. My hopes were all high from Flyy Gryl, but thats the only good book that Omar written. I was so upset by this that I actually wanted to write Omar Tyree myself and ask him what the hell was going on. I mean when you write a bad book chances are that no one is going to want to read the next book. I hate reading a bad book because I feel it is just a waist of my time, and I could've done somthing better. Omar, you owe my 4 hours of a good book
If you don't know much more about Woodrow Wilson than an overview of the important events of his life, this book isn't going to help much. There's very little political analysis, almost no attempt to portray what diffiulties Wilson needed to overcome, and no passion at all in the writing. Actually this book feels a lot like a high school term paper that someone knew they had to write and just wanted to turn in for a passing grade. Auchincloss talks a bit about the two Wilsons (one good one bad) and hints at Wilson's dependance on women, but neither of these positions is fleshed out or used consistently. Maybe Woodrow Wilson's life is just too large for a book this small
I purchased this took and then found that it was just a reprint from several decades ag
There is no doubt that Antonia Fraser's "The Journey" is written in the author's usual wry, witty and highly engaging style (although I must say that I never before heard of sex described as "lugubrious.") There is also no doubt that Fraser has done a great deal to redeem Marie-Antoinette's shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the French people. The book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable. However, I was disappointed to see that Fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions. For one thing, why does Fraser act like Marie Antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage? What about Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst (Catherine the Great) who was also a young stranger in a foreign land? This sort of thing happened all the time - it was what being a princess was all about. I was glad that Fraser did not fall into the myth of Louis XVI's impotence/ phimosis and surgery and all that. She simplistically portrays him as being asexual, which was not true, because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed "it." But never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of Fersen and the queen fiddling with  primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion. I must say, it is a first. Fraser insists that Marie Antoinette slept with Fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof, while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character. I usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character, but I guess Fraser does. Oh, well. It is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography. I found it absurd when Fraser insists that the tormented queen of France was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the French people now enjoy. If the queen had had her way, her descendant would be reigning today, and that is just the reality of it. For a better study of Marie Antoinette's relationship with her husband, I would recommend Vincent Cronin's "Louis and Antoinette." As for better biographies of the queen, let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of Delorme and Bertieres will soon be available in English
I was so upset after I finished reading this book.  I wish it wasn't updated and they just kept it in its original version.  If you are looking for a historical information of how the samurai lived and their values, this is the wrong book.  Read Bushido: The Soul of Japan.  The Code of The Samurai really felt like The Code of the Japanese Business Man
I don't really understand all the reviews about Sun Tzu's work. People saying that this one or that one is closer to the original; are there really that many experts in ancient Chinese out there. How can anyone say which is the best translation unless they are personally familiar with the original, in the original Chinese, and if that the case they should write their own version
I am Vietnamese and I grew up in New Orleans during the 80's and 90's when the first waves were settling down there.  I hate to tell this to everyone on this site but this book is the worst piece of fiction ever written.  Like many books written by someone who does not belong to the culture that he writes about, the book takes great liberties with the imagination and presents the stories from the viewpoint of the writer and not the actual people.  The Vietnamese characters in the book are portrayed as backwards, uneducated, and simple.  Further, the stories are depressing and very few of the characters seem to have any success. If you actually grew up in New Orleans during the time that the Vietnamese Americans were setting root during the 80's and 90's, you would know that by and large, the community pulled itself from nothing to become quite successful.  No real Vietnamese American thinks or acts like the characters portrayed in this book.  I repeat - no Vietnamese American thinks or acts like the characters portrayed in this book.  The book repeats many of the fallacies that I have noticed in other books written by predominantly caucasian male authors about East Asian Culture.  There always seems to be 1) an asian prostitute 2) caucasian guy with asian bride 3) asian male in an emasculated role 4) asian people as backwards and simple.  Quite sad.  This book reminds me quite a bit of Memoirs of a Geisha, though that portrayed Japanese culture in a better light.  By the way, the lady on which "Memoirs of a Geisha" is based and written about was quite upset at the author of Memoirs of a Geisha and did not feel that it portrayed her life or her thoughts in any way at all.  Regardless, if you really want to find out about the Vietnamese American experience you should really read a book written by a Vietnamese American
While this book is a good reminder to high school students and their parents of the kinds of illiberal attitudes extant on many college campuses, I cannot recommend it to other readers. The author unfortunately perpetuates the right-wing-Republican-only stereotype believed by many outside evangelical Christianity. She battles as much for her political leanings away from gun control and in favor of all Bush administration policies as she does for the truth claims of the gospel. Indeed, in reading some of the chapters, it is difficult to see that she has any concept of a Christian worldview that might veer in any part from Republican platform positions. This is really too bad, because she makes many good points and appears to be courageous in her positions. I would not have begrudged her political point of view at all, had she made a clearer distinction between that and her theological position
Let me say right off the bat, I am a skeptic, but still I loved author Gary Goldschneider's first two books from this series: the Secret Language of Birthdays and the SL of Relationships.  But this one, THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF DESTINY is a bore.Rather than offering two pages to each birth date, as Birthdays did, or a half of a page as Relationship did, this book gives the reader a short 1/4 page paragraph that allegedly sums up the destiny of those born in each of the 48 personology periods. This information is so general and by the way so boring that it could relate to anyone if in fact you don't fall asleep reading it.For this reason, I do not recommend THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF DESTINY. -- Regina McMenami
I purchased this commentary for an in-depth study that I was doing on Wednesday evenings.  I carefully checked a bunch of commentaries on Amazon, hoping to find the one that would help me with insights that I could share in the study.Unfortunately, this volume hasn't lived up to my hopes.  I didn't need something that would offer the obvious points (I can do that myself).  I was hoping for something that would offer insights into some of the more difficult and confusing passages, including thoughts on how those passages apply to our lives today.  I've been disappointed.  I am now well into the study and rarely even check the book anymore as I'm gathering information.I was between this one and the Carson commentary.  Obviously, I think I made the wrong decision.  (Not that there's anything theologically wrong in the text - it's just not what I was hoping for.
While I only am a little over half way through this book, I'm finding myself hating Will.  He's pathetic and boring and not at all a character that I can cheer for.  This book has been a tedious read overall.  I keep pushing through because I feel like it has to get better, yet so far it has not.  I'm happy that I checked this out from the library, so that I can return it and not have it collect dust on MY shelves.  The only reason why I'm even writing a review is that I'm so shocked about all the positive comments this book has received thus far.  I looked on Amazon to see if my thoughts were shared by others; I'm surprised that they are not.  I usually like this genre of fiction, but in terms of this book all it is is a bunch of whining and self-loathing
I wanted to like this book but was very disappointed that all it included was a mish mash of Vanity Fair articles from 1990-2002 with follow up paragraphs that appear to be right out of People magazine
A subject of eternal fascination especially for basketball &quot;nuts&quot; who grew up in New York.   We idolized the terribly tarnished CCNY &quot;Wonder Five&quot; who set an unbreakable record by winning both the NIT and NCAA titles in 1950 (it can never be repeated because of the way the tournaments are now scheduled). This book is a fictional addendum to Rosen's non-fiction treatment of the original basketball &quot;scandals&quot;, as he outlines in his NPR interview. Unfortunately there are glaring albeit minor errors -- Broadway and 43rd Street cannot be on the east side of Manhattan; Madison Square Garden has been on 23rd Street, and is now above Penn Station; in between it occupied the block bounded by 49th and 50th Streets and Eighth and Ninth Avenues.  These errors are particularly galling in a book by a New Yorker who played at Hunter College, and they undermine the author's credibility and care in writing. Since this is a fictionalized account of a real occurrence, the game of who is this really is inescapable.  Hence it is most unfortunate that Rosen in his interview avers that some players who were not prosecuted went on to pro careers, and &quot;a couple are in the Hall of Fame.&quot;  This tarnishes by inclusiveness such stalwarts as Bob Cousy (Holy Cross, '49), Dick McGuire (St. Johns, '48), Bobby Wanzer (Seton Hall, '46), and Frank McGuire, the legendary coach at St. John's, North Carolina and South Carolina
This book explains very well the growing paranoia of modern parents. This is a resolute attack against parenting determinism. It is regrettable, however, that the author's references are not more "scientific" than those he reproaches to parenting determinism advocates of using. Moreover, he is not far from praising spanking, which is "proven" very bad for children
This bok was very boring i found it hard to stay awa
This book is yet another attempt at degrading the white race.  There is nothing wrong with being white, just like there is nothing wrong with being black.  If you want to hear someones idea on whats wrong with being white instead of looking at the facts then you should read this book
This book was written so long ago, but has been re-released with a new cover. It contains racist terms and old fashioned dialog. I wished I had been more aware and had bought a more updated history of New Orleans.
This is not a good study guide for an employment law class.  Too basic and general.  This may be good for a business owner wanting basic info about hiring/firing etc, but they would definitely still need to seek the advice of an attorney
Please be aware that this book contains very explicit information about every topic of sexual nature. Read this book yourself before giving it to your child. It discusses oral sex, anal sex, how to use and purchase condoms, masturbation (for girls and boys), etc. When the author discusses Exploring Your Own Sexuality, she says that if she had known about masturbating sooner she would have straighter teeth, as she would have stopped sucking her thumb. The cover of this book gives no clue to the depth of information covered within. It is in no way appropriate for a girl under the age of twelve. For many parents even the age of twelve would be inappropriate
I didn't expect this series of books to be laid out the way they are. I am disappointed that the "notes" are simply a glorified glossary arranged by chapter rather than alphabetical. Key points from the book are not bulleted or organized based on content presentation, rather key terms are defined and that is all.
My blood was boiling as I read other customers' rave reviews of "The Prince of Tides."  Whoever considers this thesaurus-scrubbing, self-indulgent mess of cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and literature.  Someone was even audacious enough to compare Pat Conroy to Virginia Woolf.  What a joke!  Woolf's writing is brilliant, original, and real.  She cuts to the quick, whereas Conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite descriptions.  One can almost see Conroy congratulating himself on each simile and metaphor as he writes, not caring how superfluous or artificial his language is -- nor how unrealistic it makes the story.  I laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the characters' mouths.  In the real world, nobody is as self-concious and self-reflexive as the characters in this book.  They do not speak in reams of figurative language.  I cannot even get into how inconsistent and impossible the characters are, especially the children.  Also, Conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates the cultural gulf between them.  (I make that claim as a Southerner who lived in NYC for four years.)  It's one of many, many flaws in this ridiculous book.  Read it if you like sensational stories with mass appeal (John Irving, etc.), but avoid it if you have any respect for the English language and for real American literature (Cheever, Plath, Hemingway, Cather, etc.).  Don't be fooled by all the fools out there. 
Do not buy this book.  This author belives that he can cure Dyslexia with his mind's eye.  You can not cure dyslexia you just have to learn a different way from the norm with the right tools such as an Orton-Gillingham based program.  I bought this book by mistake not looking carefully at the author.     
This book is a standard one for graduate-level algebra courses.  I practically wore mine out over a year-long course, and came to know it intimately.  Dummit and Foote is a book that teaches via wordy explanations and lots of examples.  Of course, examples are very important.  However, the explanations are often muddled and not clear (e.g. see tensor products).  They frequently relegate important theorems or definitions to the exercises, and the organization is poor.  Consequently, it can be very hard to find things later when you might need them.  Also, the bindings on this book frequently fail.  My book fell apart very quickly, and I know other students who had the same problem.  I recommend Rotman's Advanced Modern Algebra instead of Dummit and Foote.
Mr. Haqqani's views about his mother country are very dubious. The only question I have for the author as he served in some very corrupt governments as their partner...What has he done for his home land? Nothing!!! This book in waste of time.
I was rather disappointed in Mr. Peterson's work. He dwells much too long on trying to convince us of &quot;the problem&quot;. Nearly the first half of the book is spent on statistic overload!  Even after wading through the  numbers and graphs, I am still skeptical of his conclusions and would  caution readers to do further research.  Certainly the Baby Boomers are an  aging bulge in the population of the US and will create some challenges.   However, the author fails to mention the &quot;echo boom&quot; (baby  boomer's children which are equal in number) and he glosses over the impact  of the huge young immigration population that comes into the country every  year.  Both of these facts will &quot;soften&quot; the impact of the  &quot;Gray Doom&quot; that Mr. Peterson tries to create.  I just don't  anticipate the tremendous problem of which  he tries to make us aware.  But  I did find interesting the apparently huge impact that abortions and birth  control will have on our future. Another disappointment was very little  discussion of aging trends and buying habits. Despite these shortcomings, I  enjoyed parts of the book and it stimulated thinking about the future and  the impact of aging populations
Excellent , how to technical reference, easy to read and understand, a must have book for those interested in biodiesel, and / or waste vegetable oil
I started reading this book hoping for the best.  In turn, I found that my hopes weren't fulfilled.  The beginning half was intriguing and kept me wanting more.  After the tone changed, the book became bitter and boring.  The characters lost their flare, and the whole book lost personality.  The book became dull and lost appeal to me.  The book's writing style, in the beginning, was original and fun.  Following the death of Little Red the book slowly fell apart, leaving me tempted to stop reading the book. If someone asked me to recommend a good book, this would not be the one
I cannot believe this book had such a high number of positive reviews. I have read some bad books in my life but this one is one of the absolute worst!I am amazed that all the references to CHILD murder and rape can be overlooked by the rest of the reviewers
I can tell you first hand how Amazon makes easy money. I am a formal seller here at Amazon. Not a big seller,but an honest one with a 5 star rating and zero claims.However Amazon allows dishonest buyer's to do chargebacks months after a purchase and then has nothing in place to assist seller's in getting their merchandise back. Sounds like retail fraud to me!! I wish there was a lower rating to give to this website.They are truly at the bottom!
I bought this book and also Last Night based upon the gushing reviews you see above.  Who are they kidding? The main character is a cad.  It is far from "a tour de force" in erotic anything. His short stories in Last Night are only marginally better. Your time is better spent with other authors
Overall, I found this book disappointing.  In its defense, its basic thesis of the movement of Jewish American Orthodoxy towards the `right' (more closed and intensely religious) is interesting, and I am sure accurate, and Heilman's analysis of its evolution is insightful and well-researched.  However, I was extremely bothered by the lack of any attempt to portray Hareidi society through the prism of its own value system, or in fact any attempt to understand their values at all. Heilman accepts his own world view as absolute and obvious to the reader, and in this context denigrates a society with an entirely different set of goals and aspirations. Examples of this include his assumption of the primacy of feminism and the worth of secular culture.  Hareidi society has its own worldview which, although too complex to elaborate on here, has valid and very real reasons for its hierarchy of values, reasons which Heilman completely disparages or ignores.  (For an example of a book that is not written by a religious author, yet is able to appreciate Hareidim from their own perspective try "Real Jews" by Noah Efron).  In general, I found his view of religion as a mere sociological construct (i.e. a defensive reaction to the Holocaust) to be grossly insensitive to the Hareidi intense religious belief founded on thousands of years of tradition. The latter half of the book I found a pathetic attempt to draw conclusions from insignificant pieces of information.  For example the juxtaposition of poster A condemning something to a poster advertising B implies that poster A is condemning B as well.  Or two posters (put out by the same company) advertising two different types of music indicates that the community is embattled over the appropriateness of one type of music.  In conclusion, although I eagerly awaited this book and found a fraction of it interesting and intelligent, my overall impression is negative due to the authors biased approach and manipulative use of insignificant information.
Eliot Cohen has an impressive background in policy work (OSD) and academia (Naval War College and Harvard).  I had high hopes for this book because I thought his experience with the military combined with his academic work would produce a focused and well-grounded work.  I was disappointed.  I never really bought his argument that political leaders can lead war better than generals.  He seemed to cherry pick leaders than fit his mold.  I could not believe that someone who works so closely with the military would generalize military leadership in such a stereotypical way.   The article might have made a good article in a foreign affairs journal, but the author seemed to fill out the book with a lot of interesting but not really relevant historical stories and facts.  The Lincoln chapter providing nothing that has not been stated numerous times in more detailed and focused work.  The Churchill chapter was the best. Cohen obviously has extensively studied Churchill.  His sections on how the historical view of Churchill have ebbed and flowed over the years was well done, thought not rally tied to the focus of the book.  I learned the most from the Ben-Gurion, since I knew the least about him.  The book may be useful to an undergraduate class studying political leadership or foreign policy, but beyond that the book unfortunately offers little that is new or of great interest.   
I looked through this book at a craft store the other day, and as a person who loves the ocean and seashells, I found maybe one project in here that I would consider making.  Just about every project uses a ridiculous amount of shells so imagine the cost would be prohibitive and for this reason projects look overly ornate.  Unless that is the look you are seeking to accomplish, I wouldn't recommend this book.  Try to find "Decorating with Seashells" by Anita Louise Cran
Is that those who read it and believe it, believe they actualy have girlfriends!!! Come on! admit it you are guys who wear black sabbath t-shirts and live in your parents basements. You also believe that you can get control of you live by chanting some spells from a book made to get your money.  Look, go get a hair cut, take a bath and loose 10 pounds and you will probably get that girl friend that you talk about.  Oh by the way the Necronomicon is fiction! . . except for the real copy that is in my basement, in my parents house where I used to live when I was 15
The author tries to bring both the biography of Walsingham and a discussion of the birth of espionage together in the same book and succeeds at neither. It is a fine read if you would like a general overview of the time,  but, after reading the title and reviews, I was hoping for a detailed biography of Walsingham  or much detail on how he created the group of people who became his information gatherers.  Instead, it is a general overview of Walsingham's life with references to the work that he did. There are some interesting facts that the author brings forward that the reader might not find elsewhere , but the majority of the reading is rehashed from biographies of Elizabeth I. If you want details and a better understanding of Walsingham the man, and his life work and actions, you will need to look elsewhere
Do you like romance novels? Do you call your dogs your babies? This is the book for you. The thriller aspect of this book is far overshadowed by the romance portion, and the annoyingly repetitious mentioning of the dog could possibly drive most readers over the edge. This was my first Johansen novel, and it most certainly will be my last. Two stars for actually wrapping up the story without leaving too many loose ends. 
Waller should win an award for the most times reprocessing the same book and making money from it.  Come on.  Show some imagination
Need I say more than the above title suggests? Okay, so the upside of this book is that it has important life lessons and epiphanies from the voice of experience. There are some touching moments in this book, but even then there is still something the author is lacking. I saw the movie when it was in theatres and I have just finished reading the book. I liked the movie soooooooooo much better than the book. The movie was funny, entertaining, touching, personal, and sad at times. The book did not captivate me at all. I had trouble staying focused. Considering Beverly Donofrio's credentials--a bachelor's degree in English from Wesleyan University and a master of fine arts in creative writing--her quality of writing is very poor. Her quality of writing is more like someone who has only a highschool education, if even that. And not to go off topic, but since Donofrio has a master of fine arts in creative writing from a top notch school like Columbia U, then why doesn't she write about something else besides her getting pregnant in highschool and how that has changed her life? I mean, after all, the MFA is in creative writing, meaning she should be more creative rather than just write autobiographies all the time. She has only wrote 2 books--Riding in Cars With Boys, and Looking For Mary, both about her getting pregnant at a young age. If you liked the movie, just leave it at that. Don't bother reading the book unless you enjoy getting disappointed. And if you're interested in a novel or autobiography about teen pregnancy, then go to the local library. Don't get this one. There's other novels covering the same subject that are far superior to this one. 
More Than Human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas.The writing is often compared to that of Faulkner but I wouldn't make that connection having read a few of Faulkner's works.  Sturgeon uses many of Faulkner's narrative trademarks (i.e. streaming conscious, first person perspective of low IQ individuals, disorienting changes in first person narrative) but I didn't feel the net effect really compared to say something like As I Lay Dying.I love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously.  This results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books.  More Than Human is slow, dated and not what I would describe as genre transcending nor would I recommend it to others.  So the idea might of been original in the 50's but topics like telekenesis, ESP, computer-brain babies, and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before (Asimov) and since.  This book rarely set off that wow! button in my head or kept me turning pages.  This book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best.In 1953 there were 5 Hugo Award nominees for best science fiction book (Determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004)  The Retro Hugo awards are fascinating because the voting (in this example) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can't really be ignored.  Besides More Than Human, the far superior The Caves Of Steel, Childhood's End, and Farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi.  Needless to say, More Than Human did not win (Farenheit 451 did and rightfully so)Bottom Line:  I wanted to like this book and it doesn't surprise me that others give it such high praise.  These are probably people that don't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests
I love how many people like to say that Lawrence Walsh was a Republican. Funny. He was an Eisenhower Republican WORLDS REMOVED from the conservative movement. And let's face it: he stink bombed George H.W. Bush at the end of the 1992 campaign when Bush was gaining ground on Clinton. I'm not saying Bush would have won if Walsh hadn't indicted Caspar Weinberger on the Friday before the election, but Walsh made a next-to-impossible task unattainable for Bush. Bush got him back, of course, by pardoning Weinberger on Christmas Eve, 1992.The beginning of the book was interesting to say the least. As it wore on, however, it became a prosecutor hoping to go down in history whining about Republicans. Let's face it: people in power tend to be corrupt. They have protection the rest of us don't have. This wasn't just true about Reagan and Bush; it's true about Clinton and whoever you wish to name. About halfway through the book, Walsh concentrates his fire on the guy who was VP at the time, GHW Bush.I also find the fact it was endorsed by a number of liberals interesting to say the least. I guess when you can't beat a guy at the ballot box, you impeach him or at least try to.Right?Not worth the investment of time or money - but does have some good historical information inside.
Do you feel different from people around you?  Do they resent your ingenuity?  Have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs?  Do you long for the company of others like yourself, who, tragically but inevitably, are biologically destined to wipe these shorter, darker subhumans from the face of the earth?  Congratulations!  You are either in the aryan nations or the Clan of the Cave Bear fan club, possibly both!(I exaggerate- you could be a nineteenth century English settler in Australia, or a Boer in South Africa, or maybe you just like Larry Niven, but that's beside the point)I can forgive Auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book.  In the late 1970's when she did her research, we didn't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of Neanderthals, and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at Wikipedia.  Ultimately we'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like, and Auel's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion.Similarly, her bloated, almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author, though one wonders what parasite infected her editor.  I haven't read her more recent works, but I imagine she has probably improved.  Even with the pendulous sentences Clan is not unreadable.What infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story, nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged.  The story reads like a near-literal historicization of Helena Blavatsky's Secret Doctrine on the fall of the "aryans"- who interbred with "subhumans" introducing the world to, oh I dunno, domination by the unworthy, blind tradition, suppression of the individual, all the hallmarks of the book's neanderthal culture.  Of course, even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed Ayla is innocent, overpowered by a brutish thug.Against this master narrative, all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression.  I would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet, and give Auel's books a wide berth.Also?  Enough rape scenes already
Ugh. I did not even try to finish the book. It is full of sexual content. Not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature
While this book is a good attempt at placing statistical topics necessary to toxicology in one spot, the mistakes are inexcusable.  Many formula are incorrect as well as text referring to the wrong tables or data. Therefore, one begins to lose trust in the information presented.  Be careful if you use this book
This book is total self-propogating hogwash.  Garbage. Save your money, and your life, avoid this book like a big mac
This is for beginners, it's filled with useless forms, and it provides very little information beyond a common-sense and reasoned approach to real estate.  Surely there must be better resources than this
This is basically a commercial pitch for Dr. Murad's spas and products. Unless you are planning on buying his regime, he gives very, very scant information about how you could accomplish the program using other, less expensive products. Don't expect an easy how-to giving you day by day advice of supplements and skin care. It's not here. I decided to buy this based on other's good reviews. Now I'm thinking that they were written by employees. I was very disappointed

Extremely difficult to dig through the excessive examples in order to find the relevant theorems and results. Because of this, the problems at the end of each chapter become exercises in tedium, as more time is spent searching for the necessary theorems in the text than in actually working out the solution. I do not recommend
A singularly dull book, the characterizations seemed flat and the peg on which the novel is hung, a South victorious with modern weapons, seemed too trivial.  The author has to make something compelling in that conceit or for the reader the book will mean nothing.  Unfortunately there seems little real purpose to the idea unless one finds the characterizations of historical figures believable and they are not.  The character of Robert E. Lee in the book is just too, too good to be sympathetic or even credible and the stock characters that pop up to lend support seem like cardboard cutouts.  I finally felt that the book was going in such an obvious direction that I put it down halfway through.  I am not sure if it turns out the way I think but frankly there was nothing in the first half of the book to make me care one way or the other
The only misstep so far in a wonderful series.  I was so eager for the book, I got a copy of the British edition, before it got to the US.  But I was disappointed.  Somehow this just just doesn't get off the ground.  Could Davis be tiring of Falco?  It seems to me that she is.  Maybe it's time to DO something, Lindsey!  Make some real changes in tbe characters' situations or kill them off.  Real dullness in the supporting cast and plot, and the main characters (besides Falso, who always has a life of his own) pall
A 600+ pages tour of Flash MX buttons and menus... with just a couple ridiculously elementary  "tutorials" thrown in. Makes me think of somone who had to write a flash book and has never done anything with it but figure out how the user interface works.  You won't find anything useful in here, that is about CREATING something with Flash. As for me I am never gonna buy a book from this author again, and I am probably also ditching the whole "savvy" line as well.
This series is a travesty. I understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series, but let Laura, not MacBride, have the last word on her family's experience. So much in his books rings false: the clumsy historical allusions, the narrative voice, the potty humor . . . One of the greatest things about Laura Ingalls Wilder's work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she, the main character, grows: Big Woods is written for little girls and Happy Golden Years for young women. MacBride doesn't manage this and talks down to readers. There is a tiny thread of Laura in these books, but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans. Sampling is for rap, not fiction.
My paperback copy fell to pieces after ten days! It is full of nice photographs but when the individual pages are lying in a chaotic heap on the floor it hardly matters how pretty the pictures are or how intelligent the text is, does it
After reading the trilogy, I was left wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.   Pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book. Spoilers ahead.  What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him.In addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  And what happened to the `temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!  Pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons. After having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in Him or anything for that matter!  This is NOT children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one. We never get closure on Lyra's parents.We never really understand what Dust is and where it comes from.We never see Will reunited with his mother.We get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how.Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it.The mulefa and Mary Malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably, Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing.The major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. It all just sort of disovles.Mary forgot to be the Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.Another reader pointed out:" Phillip Pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly." It would have been better if Lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime. Absurd.This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life.
I really feel stupid about ordering this book. Why did i do it?. The story is that Stacey is moving Back to New york
I had high expectations for this book, but I was disappointed.  It concentrated too much on digital systems, rather than broadening the definition of noise to cover the natural environment.  I lost interested in the last 1/3 of the book, and couldn't wait to finish
Well  After I received the book I have to say I was quite disappointed because I am one of those people who gives great importance to presentation in the books .After I read the reviews I thought I was going to get a book with lots of nice photographs and various nicely set tables .It turned out that it was just like an encylopedia with lots of recipes and couple of boriiinggg pictures .If you are a visual person like me who likes to read cookbooks when you go to bed DONT BUY IT.The other important thing was that many important ingredients were missing in the greek food that was presented 
I am not impressed with Tiffen filters I got in this set.  The finish of the rings are poor.  Despite of previously poor reputaion, I recently purchased some 67mm Quantaray filter from the local Ritz Camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of Tiffen filters.  I never got Tiffens before, had good experience with Hoyas.  I will probably stay with those from now on.  Now come to think of it, Ritz camera indicated the Quantaray they had were made by Hoya.  The glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the Hoyas and the Quantarays.  Not a good sign.The circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after 10 sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off.  Quite frustrating.  All of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them, not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame, but none of the other filters I got before had this kind of problem right out of the box.The set might be cheap, but it sure is for a good reason
As a professional photographer, I find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year. My equipment is my livelyhood and although  it is used often, I am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it.  I use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera.  These cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them.  Eventually, the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground. (This has happened twice to me and fortunately I was able to catch the flash unit!)The cord is indespensible if you need it, but contact Canon USA and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months
The documentation is terrible. Its going to take a lot of practice. If you're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine. However I want to use it off-camera to trigger 2 x SB600s.Just setting the D200 to fire a pre-flash that will trigger the SB800/Masster & SB600s it's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail, in the manual.The SB800 is designed for this purpose. So why not include information on how to do this?
I purchased this camera in August 2006 and have sent it out for repair 4 times already for the same problem and it is November 2006. Kodak just keeps telling me to send it to get repaired. Is that right?It takes great pictures but when you try to download them to your computer it works the first time. You try to do it a second time and it freezes and gives you a cannot read device message. I have two kids and the most important thing is to send picture emails to all the relatives across the globe on their updated lives. I now have to go to my local photo place to get a CD and prints made and then download them into my EasyShare software. Oh, shouldn't it be easier after spending that much money on a camera.Also, I had to purchase a dock adapter for my printer dock. When I put the camera on the dock, it doesn't charge the battery or print pictures, the screen just goes grey. This camera has had its main board and firmware repaired and replaced every time that it has come back to me. The cost of shipping, CD's and prints has just added to the headache this camera has given me.Kodak has not been helpful at all and they inform me the only form of communication of through email. What are they afraid of, they need to face the problem and satisfy their customers.Do not purchase this camera, it is a great if you just never want to get them out of the camera
Canon's 28-135mm with IS (Image Stabilizer) is a far better choice for the money
I had my Sony DSC W70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit. The glass itself was intact, but something underneath was clearly broken. Mailed it in to the factory service company for Sony, and I was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost $181 to repair. This is 2/3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially. I have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical Sony camera.
I have had this camera since Jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings. Don't expect much from it and you will be happy. As an entry level DSLR it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. I find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light, provided that they are not moving. Cons:In landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well.Battery dies FAST. The battery I got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting, especially when shooting in RAW mode. I have yet to fill up a 1Gig card when shooting in RAW mode(Approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. Surprisingly when shooting jpegs, I get more shots per charge(Over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. I cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while I was out on a hike. So I always carry a backup film camera (my trusty Elan 7).The viewfinder is very dim. When I look through my Elan 7 and then through the 300D, it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300D's viewfinder. In indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap, especially when having to resort to manual focus. Autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. When shooting indoors, the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. I have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. This is despite having a 420Ex Flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus.The 420EX flash is supposed to "talk" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. However, with the 300d, this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed. After about five months, the shutter button started sticking. I would click it and then it would remain depressed. The shutter button would only pop back up after I jiggled it a little.Another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. And since there is only one thumbwheel, it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. For example, if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature, then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. When you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera, this is a real annoyance.So would I recommend this camera:If you are a casual point and shoot person, it's an affordable entry into DSLRs that produces decent photos. But if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately, look elsewhere
I purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last March. I kept getting blurry pictures so I called Canon technical support. They went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up. Well I followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been. So they said I should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it. Then I sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there. They sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing. Well I just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem. They never fixed the problem. Mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son's life before the age of 2. I called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor. She said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera. Well I was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late August a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera, but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped. She said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera. I told I have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before I sent it in the first time. I started to cry that my son's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when I got off the phone. The camera is worse than a disposable camera. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk. I recommend Olympus. My Olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk. I am planning on contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding this matter. Please don't waste your time on this, like I have to! I hope this helps people make better choices! Good luck! I wish someone could have forecasted this for me
Yes, it does provide a bit more eye relief, and can make it easier to see the whole frame (by making it smaller), BUT there is a major problem with this.  The eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this, and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you.  This is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses. 
I admit that I'm far from an expert on digital cameras. I did take over 32,000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years.I purchased a 510 PowerShot in July of 2005. It wasn't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work. I contacted Canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge ME for shipping THEIR faulty camera back to them. I can understand them saying, 'we'll charge you at first, BUT once we establish that the fault is due to us, we'll then reimburse you back.'I enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that Canon contact me when they received my camera (in the mail) and I also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back. (I also emailed them the same request). Neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on Canon's behalf.That in itself was enough for me and I've been bitter about that ever since. I've also told every person that I've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident. I'm pleased to say, I've steered most away from this company.What else can I say about this camera:This camera is slow at times after its taken a picture. I've missed out on some good shots due to this.It eats batteries like there's no tomorrow so one MUST have rechargeable AA's to even make this camera worth its while.I've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if I take a 3 minute movie (with this camera) in my home during the day and go outside, most things outside are VERY WHITE. Almost like looking at an infra red photograph.When filming outside, when one goes inside during the day, everything is dark. Like I said, maybe all digital cameras are this way?I wouldn't recommend this camera or anything that Canon makes if you want my personal opinion. Think about that. You have to pay the shipping for a camera that's barely a few months old and still UNDER warranty. That's disgusting, that's all I have to say.There should be a ZERO for this, not a 1 star
Good: Motor drive speed.  Grip feel. Takes Nikon lenses.  Reacts fast to pressing the shutter release.Bad: Skin tone renditions a color other than skin.  White balance doesn't balance well. Noise at anything above ISO 200, looks like 3200. CF card door tough to open. Screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot. Battery cover is not part of the battery.  Button placement not as intuitive as on the D100.  4.1MP allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements.  Dumped mine a month after I got it
This camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position.  I sent the camera for warranty service (I had it less than 7 months), and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off. They claimed this happened due to physical damage, but this occurred during normal use: I was just changing modes and the lens didn't retract. Don't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new.  Even then, don't be surprised if they renege on the warranty.I had another A410 that did the very same thing (lens got jammed), but was stolen in a break-in before I sent it out for service (so I suppose it was no loss after all).  Obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside.    In short, this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field. If you buy it, and plan to use it a lot, expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty (which I'm not doing) soon. 
I only wish I could return this camera. Its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants (what I do most) and its manual focus is difficult (very difficult) to use. My much cheaper, and lower resolution, old Minolta does a much better job in low light conditions. I find I have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus. In addition, photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so-called high-speed memory card.Don't buy this camera
Ok, I imagine if you forked over the $900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal, but I am going to say it anyway.  This little baby is way over priced, not to mention you need a lot more than just this to make it work.  You need a wireless router!!  So rather than just complain, let me tell you what I want Canon to do about it and maybe we can start a revolution! With CF cards in the 12GB range it doesn't make sense that you would need this for capacity reasons (I know those of you with the biggest and brightes 16MP that shoot in JPEG & RAW on the highest settings just laughed at me), however where this item is worth it is if you want to immediately see your shots on a big screen or computer without having to take the shot, take out the card, etc.WHAT I WANT is a bluetooth compact flash card. They make these so I know it is possible.  I would like Canon to offer support for these compact flash cards so that I can immediately sync my bluetooth computer with my bluetooth camera.  Now that would make it so that when I am in the studio or shooting a wedding, I have the mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending on card and I don't have to drag along a wireless router and I saved myself $700.  Get to it Canon - I am waiting!!!
Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some "pop" out of clouds. There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price. If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter. There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera. Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs. What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting. Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post. If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings. Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly. I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me. When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter. Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters. I originally thought, "it is Canon, it must be quality." Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters. This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters. PROS: Can be used for film or digital cameras Eliminates internal reflections and ghosting CONS: Bulky and heavy Not neutral color balance
Yes, I have to agree with the previous review.  It doesn't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources.  It doesn't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything.  If it was less expensive I wouldn't mind as much, and just chalk it up to extra protection.  But that seems to be all it's good for
After reading the many good reviews here, I too bought the Lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my Canon digital camera.  I was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted.  The only difference I noticed between the Lenmar and OEM battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the LCD screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the Lenmar battery that with the OEM.  This was not a problem until I was shooting on a 101 degree day (with the Lenmar battery in) and suddenly the screen went black.  I could view previously taken pictures (LCD OK) but any new photo I tried to take was black. I read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees.  Once the camera cooled it worked again for a while, but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos, no matter what.  So, was it the Lenmar battery's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry?  Would it have happened if the cooler running OEM battery was installed on the hot day?  I can't say for sure, but if you use a Lenmar battery I would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day (e.g. use the viewfinder, not the LCD since that generates heat, or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots). 
I am on my third off-camera cord (about one per year).  Two have broken.  As other reviewers noted, the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the "female" end of the cord loosen and eventually fail.I have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black "spring" cover over the screws on the shoe.  You can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver.  If you use Locktite on the screws then they will not loosen.  Canon should do this at the factory.I use this cord with a Stroboframe "portrait/landscape" grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light.  The stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord.When my cords failed I lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted.I am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails.  Canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable.  Unfortunately, I do not believe that there are alternative cords. It looks like I will need to keep buying Canon cords
I have owned several Canon digital cameras and like them very much.  I purchased the A520 as a gift for a family member.  After several months the lens cover problem that everyone writes about started happening.  It would stick paritally open or closed or all the way open.  The key word being stick or stuck.  I took it to a Canon Service Center and they repaired it under warranty.  After trying to use it for the 1st time several weeks later the lens cover was stuck open and would not budge.  I took it back to the Service Center and they repaired it again.  While looking at the paperwork after the repair they stated courtesy repair only and not under warranty.  It was under warranty and had 90 days from the date they did not repair it the first time.  After emailing Canon they said to just email them if I have a problem and they would see what they could do.  Very POOR.  I like Canon digital cameras but wish I had never purchased the A520.  I bought it because of it's low price, which was a big mistake
The 5x7 digital photo frame from Pacific Digital is very cheaply made, the lcd is very dark and flickers constantly.
I admit that I'm far from an expert on digital cameras. I did take over 32,000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years.I purchased a 510 PowerShot in July of 2005. It wasn't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work. I contacted Canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge ME for shipping THEIR faulty camera back to them. I can understand them saying, 'we'll charge you at first, BUT once we establish that the fault is due to us, we'll then reimburse you back.'I enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that Canon contact me when they received my camera (in the mail) and I also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back. (I also emailed them the same request). Neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on Canon's behalf.That in itself was enough for me and I've been bitter about that ever since. I've also told every person that I've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident. I'm pleased to say, I've steered most away from this company.What else can I say about this camera:This camera is slow at times after its taken a picture. I've missed out on some good shots due to this.It eats batteries like there's no tomorrow so one MUST have rechargeable AA's to even make this camera worth its while.I've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if I take a 3 minute movie (with this camera) in my home during the day and go outside, most things outside are VERY WHITE. Almost like looking at an infra red photograph.When filming outside, when one goes inside during the day, everything is dark.

The camera case only works if you wear a belt-- there is no clip on. The case itself holds only the camera, not even space for a spare battery or memory card. (I've heard the case will darken your camera, but I didn't end up using the case). The neck strap is not useful, it's too long. At '34 inches, if you're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it. (The Canon Camera rocks, however.
This camera was a pain to pick the mode to get the camera to work.  It's batteries died all the time and lost all of the pictures.  When you did get a picture loaded on the computer the software was terrible.  We trashed it within 2 weeks of purchasing
I thought I was ordering the right size batteries, but I found out too late this was not the case. Now I am unable to get full credit for them when I return them
I was super-excited to get this camera, and very disappointed with it once I did.  The pictures are blurry far more often than not, even when resting the camera on a table or solid object.  Additionally, it's so slow at taking them that ANY movement (eyes blinking, etc) likes like a massive blur.  And the video skips all the time.  It just misses entire parts.  I would highly recommend NOT getting this camera.
I have been working with this camera for about a year now, for product shots online, and while sometimes it takes great pics, many times the flash pops and whites out, or it goes off and you get a black picture. I take pictures of jewelry, and if I try to shoot a piece with green and blue coloration, the color is not accurate. Purple is another color this camera does not accurately pic up. While you can fiddle with 4 different picture taking settings, in all different modes, you'll never get the same picture twice, even saving the setting. The light has to be just so, to get a good shot. When it shoots clearly, it can take fabulous pictures, but often, pics are blurred as many others have said, when they actually come out. My old camera, the DSC P71 3.2 Megapixel is MUCH better, colors are accurate always, shooting is flawless and foolproof every time, AND the greatest feature is re-sizing your picture and trimming right on the camera before uploading. This feature is completely MISSING from the DSC P200, which was the biggest disappointment, as I figured it would be a given I didn't have to ask about when purchasing. Why would Sony eliminate this great function? Had I know that when the salesman at the large New York City Photo store told me this was the camera I dreamed of, I would not have bought it. I prefer also to use the rechargable AA batteries instead of the Lithium battery, which is super hard to load, and charging this camera is a nightmare with the charger it comes with. It is like a puzzle trying to get the charger inserted at just the right angle. Every time it takes me several minutes, and finding a good little wall charger for it is also a problem. I recently took this camera on vacation to take pics and get footage for burning to DVD. Sound quality is good, but video quality can be choppy, and the monitor did not let me even see that my setting was overexposed, so all my footage is somewhat overexposed for the entire trips shootings I made. The monitor, while big, does not show you always what you are shooting, whether a still, or movie picture. Overall, I would not recommend this camera and I actually bought a USED second of my old camera, and got my original repaired, because this one doesn't compare. This camera is a bit too complicated and not very user friendly. Even after using all this time, I STILL am not sure what I am going to get when I use this camera. I'd say the worst features to be aware of are for someone who needs accurate color, this camera clearly has trouble showing blue/green shades, and purples accurately, you can never show these colors are they are in life with this camera, and the lack of the "trimming" resizing feature, what was Sony thinking? Next time, I am trying something other than Sony Cybershot unless I hear they have gone back to making a great straightforward, uncomplicated easy to point and shoot camera. This one is definitely NOT
Probably would buy other camera if I could do over this one takes along time to gechage after flash. It is very touchy and you get alot of blurred pictures. You have to learn how to be very steady with it
As I watch the videos of my kids on my 50" plasma, 32" LCD and Mac, trying to convince myself that I like the quality, my wife walks by and says, "Fuzzy." I know most guys out there will know what I'm talking about - she just killed the deal. Regardless of the specs, the wives don't lie - the picture quality just doesn't cut it. It's unacceptably noisey in all but the brightest of light and is an incremental improvement over my 6 year old Sony DVR. The product design is cool, the price is good, the SD card recording idea is perfect, but the HD promise doesn't come close to paying off.If you're looking for sharp, crystal clear images - you're just not going to be happy with this camera unless the gathering of technology and low price are enough to cause you to settle.
When I got this camera for my birthday April 2005 I thought that it was a dream come true. The picture quality was brilliant, it was easy to use. The device was ment to be envied. It took marvelous pictures until within 3 months, July 2005- the LCD screen cracked. The camera had been in a case sitting on a bed with no possibility of misuse or accidental damage. I was never suspiscious of it until I took it to be fixed and reading countless reviews of similar problems. Something bad will happen to this camera. Either the sceen will break or the memory card thing. A friend of mine also owned the s410, and her screen broke before mine did. The camera still takes photos, but without the screen the device is near worthless as you have no options. It is not worth the price of repair. Tomorrow I am going to buy a new camera.
but the stitching was irregular on the front. I thought the company produced good products, but I was mistaken when I bought this item. Next time I'll just go to BestBuy for a camera case
When I was buying my husbands Olympus Camera this Rechargeable battery popped up as a suggested purchase to go with camera so I ordered it.  Not paying close enough attention and because the title does have stylus in it I assumed it was compatable with the camera I was purchasing at that time.  No it was not!!!  So I paid for and wraped (christmas present) something that did not only not work for the camera but made me look like a idiot shopper when my husband opened it and saw that it was not compatiable.  Now I have to figure out how to send it back for a refund which will cost me shipping charges yet again...NOT TO MENTION THE FRUSTRATION OF A RETURN!!!!NOT A HAPPY AMAZON SHOPPER!
I bought this recharger kit specifically for a Sandisk m230 mp3 player.  When I first received the kit, I charged all of the batteries.  Upon first use I only got 7min. out of each battery, when I got 20 hrs. from the batter sent with the player.  I learned online that the batteries still have their charge, but due to the battery's "memory effect" or "voltage depression," my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min.  If you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much "juice" is left in a battery, do not buy this kit
I really don't know how to write a "helpful" review for this camera, I'm not a photographer; all I can say is that I was NOT satisfied with my purchase, so...***If you're having trouble deciding which digital camera to get (like I was a few months ago), save your time and effort and start looking at other cameras.***Here are my complaints:Flash is too strong (blinding, in fact). Please do NOT take this complaint lightly, the flash is brighter than you think (it actually HURTS, I'm talking physical pain here). I actually fear it might have some long term effects, this alone is a deal-breaker for me! It's beyond me how this got past the testing stages at Nikon.Sure, you can turn the flash off. But that only brings me to my other major complaint! The lighting must be almost PERFECT if you want to take a semi-decent picture without the flash.The lens do not respond well to artificial lighting, AT ALL, pictures either come out all grainy (if it's slightly dark) or with huge white patches all over if there's a lot of light in the background.Even when the lighting is almost perfect, you lose a LOT of quality (even when using the highest settings, 6MP).The scene modes didn't help much, I tried everything, all the different modes offer so little difference, very gimicky in my opinion.Even if you want to endure the pain and suffering of the mighty flash, there's a chance the pictures will come out somewhat unclear, why? I have NO clue what so ever. I might take the same exact picture at the same exact conditions and settings a minute apart and a SLIGHTLY different pose (but still stable), and one would be blurry while the other is crystal clear!Must admit though, the swivel design is VERY practical and makes things so much easier. The video mode is great as well.If you don't mind inflicting serious pain onto yourself and others via the blinding flash, then I must admit, the pictures do come out nicely. (most of the time
this is an alright camera. if you're an average teen looking to post some hot pictures on myspace, or just someone looking to capture a few choice family moments, this camera should serve you fine.what i liked about it:1. it's compact, lightweight and easy enough to use2. pictures taken in daylight turn out pretty nice3. the battery life on this camera is much better than on other cameras i've usedwhat i disliked about it:1. it's a bit flimsy to be honest2. attempting to take a picture in the afternoon, evening or early morning is near impossible without it looking completely washed out or too dark. even though it has a night landscape option, it doesn't really work.3. the flash causes a horrible delay (but that's been mentioned like 9,000 times before)this is definitely not a camera for glamour shots. i'd also strongly discourage buying it if you're thinking of using it to take pictures at music events
I bought three of these -- one for myself and one for each pair of grandparents.  Two of them stopped working.  One of the two had tons of bad pixels and the other one just stopped.  Unfortunately, out of the warranty period!  And inquiry to the manufacturer has been ignored.I'm out a lot of money for this garbage.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!!!
I purchased this camera for my 6 yr old daughter. It isn't even good enough for a child's toy camera! She had asked for a camera with a flash and screen for viewing what she had taken photos of. This camera looked like it would fit the bill. It was small and "cool" looking, had a dock (great idea), Li-ion battery (great idea) and a skin (great idea.) Unfortunately it lacks the ability to take decent photos in varied environments (We are not always outside in the sun!) If they would put a better camera in the same package it would become very desirable.Save yourself the grief and buy something else. I'm getting a 5MP HP (for less money even!
It's a great concept, but my unit wasn't recognized by any of my 3 PC's, despite hours of work with tech support and even trying a second unit. One of my PCs runs XP (they had no idea why this computer didn't recognize the Magpix) and the others run Win98 (which they said sometimes has problems with the Magpix, although they don't say that in their marketing literature). They gave me my money back, but refused to refund the shipping charge as promised, and in addition I wasted several hours and the cost of mailing two units back to them. I suggest waiting for the next version, or even better, for a better company to introduce a similar product
I will start off by saying, I loved my Sony Cybershot.  When the Alpha came out I couldn't wait to get one.It died after 200 pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through South America.Amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within 30 days. I've spent 3 hours so far dealing with Sony.  Most people I spoke to or on-line live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to Business Support, Computers, Video.  They also contradicted one another.When I did get to someone who knew the product I was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they the would only 'repair it' not replace it.Now I am stuck with a lemon, and I fear I have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera.I highly recommend you read all the customer reviews.  Other people have had problems with the camera, I ignored them because I had faith in Sony and thought the other Alpha owners' dud cameras were unusual.If you decide to purchase anyway, I highly recommend you do not buy through Amazon, but through a real store with a good and fair return policy, that stands behine their products.  Places like Microcenter will exhange, no questions ask.  I am kicking myself because Amazon was $100 cheaper then Microcenter.  Penny wise pound foolish.I love Amazon, but, I will never buy anything other than books and DVDs from them.  Lesson learned on electronics. 
I bought this camera after owning an Olympus digital camera for years. I was extremely happy with my Olympus, but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since I'm expecting. This camera was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Just about every single picture I took had huge white blobs all over it. (This only happened when using the flash. I must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) Plus, if you used the zoom at all, the pictures came out fuzzy. The first digital camera I ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! The store I bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because I waited two days past the 14-day return policy. So, I sold the camera and took a $100 loss. I'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera
I was extremely disappointed with this product; I felt very let down by Sony, because for years I bought Sony items with confidence, knowing that anything produced by them would be good and reliable.  This item only goes to prove that Sony's standards have dropped and, as such I will use considerable caution when buying anthing else of theirs.What lets this product down is the lack of distance one can be before the sound breaks up; 2 metres (not 45 metres as stated on the wrapping) was the best I could do, and that was in a straight line.  No, all this item is fit for is the rubbish bin
I purchase this instrument twice.  The first time there were black specks in the lense, so it was returned.  The second time was worst, i.e. same black specs but the thing didn't work at all.  I have also checked this manufacturer's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense.  This isn't a quality optical product
The magnetic clasp is weak very weak - making it vulnerable to thieves with sticky fingers or opening up on it's own.  I keep this camera case INSIDE of my purse. i wouldn't recommend this product there has to be something better      
 the battery is half the side of the battery came with the camera an last half the time, an number or not the same ,an it,s not the same battery. do not buy any thing from them because lying about what they are selling
I bought this camcorder 3 months ago and, after using it a grand total of 6 times, it is broken.  It constantly loses track of timestamp on the tape doing things like rewinding 2 minutes (two minutes on the counter in the display), refusing to rewind anymore and telling me the tape is full.  It's a 60 minute tape and it can only record 2 minutes???  I figured that was a problem with the tape so I tried another one, which seemed to work fine until I got home and tried to watch the footage.  The camera counter once again became confused and the whole camera just locked up.  I had to power off and on several times before finally getting the camera to rewind the tape to where I needed it to be.  Lastly, the mechanism for ejecting the tape broke after only one month.     One last note, the support for Panasonic is horrible too.  You can't talk to a "real" person and instead have to go through an annoying robotic voice recognization "person".  I'll never buy another Panasonic product again...give me Sony
The default supplier for this item is Adorama.  They have sku numbers mixed up on the back end, so they will ship you the HP 6221 dock instead.  Will not work with the R series.They do not even carry the actual HP 8887 dock.  Huge hassles, so click on the new and used link and buy directly from Amazon.  It's a few dollars more, but at least you get the right item
I was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this Ziga Digital Frame. I returned it
My wife purchased this for me as a Christmas present.  It started displaying pixels on the screen after about 2 months.  I've called Digital Spectrum, sent faxes and emailed them.  This has been going on for nearly a month.  A real waste of money & my time
I owned this Sony for a single day before I returned it to Amazon.  First off, it records in MPEG2 format which is fairly compressed, and looks it once you upload to your computer.  It is also not natively supported on the Mac without a 20$ additional Quicktime MPEG2 plugin.  Which has to be converted before editing. Which makes it a slow, tedious affair.  Also, the included software is, surprise, PC only.    Other problems, not computer related - the Chroma shift in "night mode" is intense, making the healthiest of complexions appear sickly.  I'm not expectant of miracles in night modes, but it seems like a simple solution on the production side(Sony).  The auto white balance could also use the same attention.  Like the previous reviewer pointed out, not a bad camera for the money if you're not serious about editing and you're using a PC.  The LCD touch screen is a nice addition and easy to use.  All in all, I would go for a Canon
Don't let the product description fool you into thinking it will work with a ZR85mc camcorder. It didn't work with mine. It didn't even fit
I've purchased seven items from Amazon in 2005, so I'm not a complete rookie. This item's ad title includes the word "Battery" in big, bold letters . I purchased this kit advertised with a "Used Price", but "Condition: New". The ad picture clearly shows a battery. I had looked at several ads and did not read the individual Seller's comment "BATTERY MISSING" in uppercase, though in regular font. To me, a missing part warrants more of a warning than a "comment". That's my "lesson learned", but I still find it confusing to advertise both complete and incomplete kits together under identical ad titles without a prominently displayed warning in big, bold text indicating that the most valuable part is missing. LESSON LEARNED: READ THE WHOLE AD FOR THE SPECIFIC SELLER, ESPECIALLY THE "Seller's comments"
we had this camera for about a year until on Thanksgiving Day while out of town it broke.  The lense just froze while in the middle of taking a picture and wouldnt ever go back into the camera.  We ran out to Best Buy and purchased it again because it was just a simple to use basic camera for me and my dad.  (2 years later the old cameras lense still wont go back into the camera yet the camera still will turn on..weird.)  At first we liked the camera and it took good pictures.  They look great when we got them developed (costco.com is the best place to upload them and 1 hour later you pick them up, super cheap too) and the quality was good.  Within the last year the camera has turned into a piece of crap.  Evvvvvery picture comes out blurry it seems.  Inside or outside.  I am constantly telling people who take pics for me to take 2 or 3 pictures because i KNOW one or two will be blurry and that is a great shot i will miss because of it.  Also the flash quality is horrible.  It takes okay pictures of people in the dark but if it's of an object (anything really, just not a person) it comes out pitch black.  Inside the lighting is bad too. The camera can never focus and it's just annoying. I also went through 2 or 3 memory sticks made by Sony that for no reason just broke.  One of them broke while in a store getting them developed (in the little machine) and erased all of my pictures which was very dissapointing.  The people said there was no way it was their machine, that it had to be a default in the memory stick.  Also the camera is pretty big and clunky.  At the time it was actually a smaller camera on the market, now it is huge!  I am looking into now buying the Canon powershot 6.
I bought this camera to mainly use the Digital macro mode, it worked great for several months, now it will not lock focus, this camera is very frustrating, every picture that I take I have to edit to lighten the picture, I tried just about every setting to get the pictures to come out, to no avail, I am a commercial real estate appraiser, so I have taken close to 2000 pictures with this camera, and just about every one I had to lighten, now the Macro mode wont work, I will not buy another cannon product ever again!!
The main reason I ordered this kit was for the battery.  When I received it ....NO BATTERY included.  I contacted Amazon and all they could do was give me a number for Sony customer service.  Thanks Amazon!!
I tried the trick of resizing, but honestly, the image quality is still abyssmal. The images are so low-resolution that only the vaguest of detail comes out. Please, if you're thinking of buying this for someone for Christmas this year, choose something else. It might be okay for someone with low standards or poor eyesight, but for anyone who can see well and knows what a good digital image looks like, this will be a huge disappointment.The good news is that in a few years these digital keychains will have advanced and will offer much better performance - that's almost guaranteed. So put this one on the "must buy for mom" list for the 2008 Christmas season.I very seldom write a review, and only wrote this one to keep people from making the same mistake I did
This keychain photo viewer sold by a company called "Smartparts" is identical to one sold by "Argus."  Neither company manufactures the device nor do they offer a shred of tech support.  You buy this, you're on your own.  You seem to be able to find the Argus one a little cheaper... though they do mar the front of it with a big, black imprint of their logo.In any case, this thing is maybe worth $20 as a novelty.  Don't pay more.  Image quality is mediocre and the software, while functional, is stunningly primitive.  If you can pick it up cheap and approach it with low expectations, it's a kind of cute gizmo.  But don't give yourself agita by overpaying for an obsolete little toy.  Check the bargain bins for this thing, or just wait for the next generation device.-- m
Horrible camera. Barely had it 2 months before it went on the fritz.Drained the batteries within a few pictures.So not worth more then the cost of a disposable!! Sorry Kodak...but I'll stick with the good ol' reliable Sony
I realize this is not a true gunshot mic though I had hope. The product presents itself as cheap and I hate to say the results are not good quality.  At this time, I'm the only reviewing customer and I can see I must have been the only guy to buy one of these.  Product attaches well and there is a noticable change in the audio.  Three settings, zoom (syncs with camcorder's zoom), gun (which maxs the zoom of the mic regardless of video zoom), and off.  I purchased this to make recordings of presentations better.  I know now that I should have just bought a wireless mic for the speaker.  I thought I'd get more use this route
I bought this for my husband for Valentine's Day, so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy.  Unfortunately, the images appeared for one day, and then the unit stopped working.  We had to send the unit back.  I was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item. 
I have to say that I really wanted to like this camera. It takes good pictures and the ultra-wide lens is a nice feature. It is quite compact and has a nice screen. The software is reasonably good and has a nice presentation to the user interface.Why 2 stars? Ok here's the bad stuff:1) In the first shipment I got, the normal mode (non-ultra-wide angle) didn't work. The images were garbled and almost unrecognizable. The ultra-wide images were fine. I attributed it to getting a random lemon and returned it for an even exchange. The second V570 I got from Amazon worked fine until about 5 months later and then the normal mode crapped out on me. So, I don't think it is just a random problem. There appears to be a reliability issue with the non-wide angle part of this camera since it seems statistically unlikely that I would randomly get two cameras with the exact same problem. My V570 is now a nice-looking paperweight and I use a Casio Exilim EX-Z70. 2) The stand seemed nice at first until it came time to travel. You have to unhook the whole thing and lug it around with you if you want to charge your camera or download pictures and movies without a card reader dongle. Also, since you have to charge the battery in the camera, you can't charge a spare battery while you are taking pictures with the other. For comparison, my new Casio EX-Z70 has a USB cable that is easy to stick in the pocket of my bag and has an external battery charger. So, if one battery is dead I can leave it behind in the charger while I take pictures with the spare.3) The movies that you take with this camera are stored in MOV format instead of AVI or MPEG. While it does play in most PCs if you have installed Quicktime, it is not supported by my streaming media player (D-Link DSM-320RD) and is difficult to work with in the video editor/DVD creator SW I use (Sonic MyDVD). I can't say how widely MOV is supported compared to AVI and MPEG, but that format created problems for me.So, I applaud Kodak for not clinging to the sinking boat anchor of the photographic film business and going digital. But I think a few more usability studies and more attention to reliability would help make this a winner in future iterations
I was counting on a THREE HOUR working battery. After all, that's what it says it gives you.  So far all I get from it, after more than a month of use, is two hour, max..
I was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this, for hawk and bird watching. I had looked at Swarovskis, but they were way out of my budget, nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution.These binoculars are crystal-clear, with sharp focus. The 42mm lens lets in lots of light, lots more than the 35's I've been using. I wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing. There are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm, nice because I always used to lose them.For the price, these can't be beat

This is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners against.The first red flag is the ridiculously high maximum magnification of over 700x. Do you know what you will see at 700x in this scope? Nothing but a dim blur. Note that the objective (main) lens is 60mm. All telescope optics have inherent limitations; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x. Therefore, with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x,  increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown, and that's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good. The finder is useless, smaller than the bare minimum size of 6x30.  Finding anything but the moon will be time-consuming and frustrating.  The low power 20mm eyepiece may or may not be usable on the scope, depending on its design and field of view.  That the design information is not given in the ad is disturbing.  And don't even think of using the 4mm (high power) eyepiece or the barlow.  I do not recommend equatorial mounts for beginners.  Their tracking properties are primarily for astrophotography, and for this they require careful setup.  The equatorial mount on this scope is provided primarily as a marketing gimmick to impress nave buyers with its complex "scientific" appearance.  In a way, it is hard to fault Celestron for making and marketing this scope.  Their upper-tier instruments are quite good, but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this.  In one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models.  Just make sure, gentle reader, to stay away from the toys.Using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an MP3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. It is a learned skill. And you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. Buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. If you want to see the wonders of the sky, contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. The members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. The best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on Amazon), then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8") Dobsonian; Celestron's own 6" Starhopper can be found on Amazon for under $290.For more information on buying telescopes, see my encyclopedic guide on Amazon: "So you want to buy a telescope.
I own the Olympus FE-100 Digital camera, and it came with unchargeable batteries (oxyride). I switched to Energizer Batteries and bought an Energizer 4-battery charger that can be had for less than the price of half a tank of gas. It's not a quick charger like this one, but I say for less than half the investment, I've got a charger that does the job. I would NOT spend this kind of money on a charger. So I say, if you're part of the "gotta have it now" generation, you definitely pay for convenience. Otherwise, charge your batteries more slowly (2-3 hours) and save a lot of money
Just returned the mobiCam- had poor reception, even in adjacent room! smallo screen & not stable - falls easy & seems like would break very quickly with a 3 yr old in the house!
I have two 8" picture frames that are other brands, and they are GREAT and I use them for Open Houses all the time! I got this one as a gift from a friend, and it is terrible!! The instructions are difficult to understand. The wide screen makes everyone in the picture look FAT and distorted! This is a weird size and I am not happy at all!! I don't recommend it
I bought this camera for my 13-year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to Bermuda.  It was ok.  Felt sort of cheap, but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to.  BIG DRAWBACK....there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture isn't being shot, so the danger of scratching the lens is immense.  My son was so afraid of scratching the lens, that he barely used it.  Some of the few pictures that he did take were ok, but others were not of the best quality.  I think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get, and I'm surprised, because I usually love Samsung products
One of the most disastrous purchases we've ever made.  It works fine until you try to get the video images onto your computer.  Don't bother trying to consult the instruction guide; it's the worst one you've ever seen.  You could go to the website to attempt to download all the drivers that you supposedly need, but they're not actually on the website.DEFINITELY find another brand
The ME-1 provides a modest 1.2x magnification for viewfinders on Olympus's E-300 and E-500 cameras. Ideally, this would allow sharper manual focusing and more precise framing. Unfortunately, this did not happen when I used the ME-1 to make a number of trial images with my E-500, so I will be returning the ME-1 for a refund. (For the record, I wear prescription eyeglasses while shooting, with my "shooting eye" corrected to 20/20 vision.) Like other folks, I find the E-500 viewfinder a trifle small so that it's not always easy to frame a shot and see exposure data at the same time. The camera must also be pressed against your face when framing, which is not always comfortable. In some ways, the ME-1 created more problems than it solved. The ME-1 kept the camera further from my face (though it seemed to bump harder against my glasses), but at the cost of *narrowing* my angle of vision in the viewfinder. Divide the viewfinder into four equal columns and rows so you have eight squares. The four squares in the middle of the viewfinder were easily visible, but those along the sides, top, and bottom were *less* visible than before, the corners considerably less. To frame a shot, I had to move my eye around the viewfinder much more with the ME-1 than without it. To see exposure data, I had to shift my eye almost completely away from the image. More hassle than I need when shooting in the field.Fortunately, there is another option that works for me. The E-300 and E-500 come with an EP-5 eyecup, which is definitely too small for my taste. But a larger eyecup is also available, the EP-6. The EP-6 keeps the camera a little further from my face. And with the viewfinder diopter properly adjusted (a critical step no one seems to mention), the EP-6 allows me to see both the entire image and exposure data without shifting my eye very much at all. All of this will vary from person to person, of course, and there may be circumstances when the ME-1 is exactly what's needed -- so two rather than one star. But not in standard shooting conditions, especially if you need to compose, set exposure, and shoot quickly
This case will protect your camera but has no place for spare battery or even a extra memory card. It only has a spring clip to fasten it to a belt or bag there is no belt loop or other handle strap. There are other cases available with better features for less money
Quite unsatisfied with this product and will be returning the 2 I purchased as gifts. In fact, the recipients asked me to return them. Main reason, in order for it to be "portable" it requires a special battery that you can only buy from the manufacturer for an additional $30. I already spent $100, not planning on spending more money. I think PhotoCo needs to rethink their product and improve customer satisfaction.    
In my experience, this camera takes great pictures, but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily.  It stops extending and just makes a clicking noise.  This happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable.  My brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their EX-S500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended.  I would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate
My husband and I bought two of these to take on a cruise for our snorkling outting. Due to weather, the snorkeling was canceled, but we did end up using the cameras.  One we used for regular pictures, outdoor only, beacuse there's no flash, and it was okay, though the pictures were a bit grainy. The other I took on a camping trip with some high school kids and the camera jammed a few pictures into the roll, I could turn and turn the winder, and the film wouldn't advance, but it would let me take another picture. After fighting with it the entire weekend, I ended up getting about 10 pictures that could be made out, though these were grainy, too
I purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for Christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her.  This is the first time I have ever been DISAPPOINTED with a product I purchased from Amazon.  It was, in my opinion, not worth the price I paid!  The picture looked much larger that it actually was.  I wil continue to purchase through Amazon but I will be much more careful and definitely return it if I'm not satisfied.  In this case I did not have time to find another camera case. Thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion.Linda Sutto
I purchased the camera in mid June 2006. After 1 month/1 hr of recording the screen went black when in recording mode. It took the shop about 7 week to fix the problem. I used the camera to record another 20 minutes and now it does not want to focus to infinite. The recording now flickers a lot and a dot appears floating around the screen. This camera has been in the shop more time than in my hands. The store were I bought it said that It would give me a new camera if this happends for the thrid time. The only problem is that if this is a design problem, what do I get by getting a new camera? Just avoid buying this camera until they fix the problem
...unless they hadn't insisted on the "geared" telescopic part. It has some sort of swivel that is supposed to raise and lower it, but the handle is the cheapest possible plastic and it broke the very first time I used it. It's extremely annoying because overall it's not a bad tripod, but it really didn't need that bit of "hi-tech", and now I am unable to use the telescopic part at all... Yes, it's lightweight and somewhat unstable, but I can live with that. The biggest problem is the bad engineering and the subpar materials...
The case looks exactly as in the pictures above, and the camera fits perfectly in it. However, the case is hardly a protection, it's not to be considered as more than a carrying bag. The velcro that keeps it closed is quite easy to open so I've dropped the case a few times while walking outdoors. Fortunately the case is designed to use the straps on the camera for carrying it around, so my camera stays with me in any event.There is a little strap on the case, supposedly to attach the case to the camera or to the straps, but it opens too easily, so it can't be trusted at all (the strap almost opens by the very weight of the case, which is not much).There is also a small pocket in the back, providing barely room enough for a set of replacement batteries (4 AA batteries) and the USB cable. Again, the velcro on it is too easy to open, even more after placing the batteries and the cable inside the pocket.Definitely, this is not designed as a practical solution. Just enough to protect the camera from dust and some scratches.If you value your equipment and want to protect it from more than the wind and the sun, while not being worried of losing the case around -or its contents, DON'T buy this one. Spend some more money and get a decent carrying case. I will
The Night Owl Optics monocular had a major flaw as soon as I started using it. The system uses high voltage derived from 2-AA bateries. Occationally the unit would create a large snap(arcing noise) and emit a bright flash of light from the eyepiece. If one is using the instrument, the light actually hurts the eye. I have returned the monocular to Night Owl for repairs. I do not know the result of the repairs as it is still in transit. They told me to ship it at my expense.Another strange requirement of the instrument is that the batteries are recommended to be removed if not used for 24 hours.Other than the above, the monocular has performed well.epilogue-Night Owl Optics did repair the unit and returned it.
The eye piece that comes with the scpe is practicaly unuseable.But of course  you can 'buy' the eye piece that really works separately from the manufacturer.The whole thing was a waste of time...I gave it to my five year old to trash.  At least he will have some fun with it that way....it's realy just a childs toy.
I bought a Sony ICD-MX20 Digital Voice Recorder a week ago.  I was surprised that Sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named "Digital Voice Editor".  Sony Customer Service staff told me that if you lost the CD that came with the box, you had to buy a new one.  Only patches of the software are available to download.The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.  Sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services.  Think twice before making your buying decision.
I bought this camera about a month ago and I am highly disappointed with it.  The quality of the pictures is very poor, showing large grain, even at SHQ and low ISO settings.  No combination of settings seems to improve quality
Straight out of the box disappointment with the extremely poor quality.  Plug into wall and does not work.  After trying numerous different outlets/wiggles of the cord, it finally powered on.  After putting in a card, the pics were ok, passable.  The mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more, and I was only playing very quiet jazz.  This is not worth the money even though it is cheap.  Pay a little more and get one that is of better quality
Grainy ISO 100 pictures at any light conditions. Usage of 5mp and low sharpness options partially solves the problem, but if you take pictures with Panasonic DMC-FZ7 and compare ... it will be clear that a garbage trash is the right place for this camera.I had Panasonic DMC-FZ7 and the only cons. is really noisy high ISO sensitivity mode.In FZ8 camera Panasonic implemented the Venus III processor (FZ7 has Venus II processor). As a result picture quality really improved at high ISO sensitivity modes but DRAMATICALLY changed for the WORSE in ISO 100 mode
Not seeing many reviews, I'm writing this as a warning. This mic is horrible. I bought it to get rid of the &quot;motor noise&quot; from my Canon Optura Pi, as many others have. When I listen now, the sound is much worse. You can barely hear people speak over the loud humming... THIS MIC IS HORRIBLE
There is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the FAQ section of the Sony website.  "If there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  This symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  However, this is not a malfunction."  READ:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  Sony does not think this is a problem.  It is a design flaw.If you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!  
When it was new out of the box it worked for baseball about 50% of the time if I was within a few feet of the pitcher or catcher.  It seemed to become less effective each time I used it to the point that now I'm lucky to get a reading 10% of the time.  It still works for clocking cars but for baseball it is almost useless. 
I bought this over the Sony and I regret it.  I get a tape eject error every time I try to rewind.  I can only rewind at 10 second intervals before I get an error message to eject the tape and do the same thing over again.  That's a long time to rewind a 60 minute tape.  Many Canon users are having this problem and the only way they address the problem which is clearly a mechanical problem is to charge a ridiculous price to send it off to be repaired.  Canon needs to own up to this problem and have a recall on the item.  I will never buy Canon again after they have turned a blind eye to a serious problem
This is the Worst camera I've ever owned. I'm not exaggerating. I'm so upset for wasting money on it. The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks.
Just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than I wanted. Never used. Returned it
I purchase this instrument twice.  The first time there were black specks in the lense, so it was returned.  The second time was worst, i.e. same black specs but the thing didn't work at all.  I have also checked this manufacturer's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense.  This isn't a quality optical product
I spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera.  In the end, it came down to Panasonic's FX01 and Cannon's SD600.  I read the warnings from other reviewers that the Panasonic's images weren't top quality, but I chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the FX01 looks like it would out perform the SD600.  I was wrong.After using the FX01 for a few days I knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo.  I really really wanted this camera to be great, but it just wasn't.  Actually, my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp FX01!  Very disappointing.  I ended up returning this camera to Amazon (very easy-great service) because of the poor image quality.  I mean, wanting good photographs is why you take photos, right?  I know someone with the SD600 and he's very happy with the quality.  Judging by the customer images on the SD600's page on amazon, I think I should've gone with Cannon
Just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than I wanted. Never used. Returned it
Overall, I was entirely disappointed with this camaera.  The packaging and description were deceiving.  There was no view finding screen, only a teeny, tiny window as in a regular camera.  This was a gift for a child who would have had just as much fun with a throw away camera.  I bought it because I wanted to give her a digital that had a large view finding screen.  The construction would not hold up to a single drop on the ground.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE

The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA.The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2. Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop. Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced! I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too
This is a poorly designed camera case.  You have to take the camera out of the case completely each time you shoot pictures. I expected the case to remain on the camera body and just uncover the lens so you can shoot. I was very disappointed. This is rather a leather box than a camera case
The camera is a great camera.it is one of the best kind of camera in its level.Everything is great in that(perfect picture and easy to work) but in that package as I saw in amazon add, the remote suppose to be in the package and comes with it but it won't and there is not remute in that package and it is kind of cheating...be careful about this product if you think whatever has written comes with package but not.
This is a nice looking brown suede camera case.  Based on all the Stylus models listed, I assumed my Olympic Stylus 595 would fit in it but, unfortunately, it does not. 
I got this charger with my SD110, and within a few months, it stopped working; it was obviously a battery problem. The battery isn't the best quality either, but when I got a new one, the problem persisted. So obviously it's the charger.
If you like to take pictures with macro lense, it sucks. I've had many canon cameras and this one takes the the prize for worst quality. If you get closer than five inches, the pictures messes up.I've had no other problem with the hardware, though I hate carrying around that dock and it's odd shaped charger. No other charger cable in the world is going to fit! So loose it and you're screwed.oh, and night photos also suck. BIG TIME, even with the flash on
I went through 2 of these in as many months - the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working. People regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldn't even distinguish between 'yes' and 'no.'
Has to be the worst phone I have ever had to pay for.  Between the missing features (no voice dial on a $200 phone?!) crippled features (I have to buy ringtones, use their t-zone for the WAP when I have the unlimited internet service already?) and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fee and find another carrier.  Anyone who would charge some much for this POS really doesn't deserve my business
The product description should state that it does not work with the Verizon V3C!  When plugged in, it states "Unauthorized Charger" and will not charge at all (although, if the battery is dead, it will give you enough juice to speak, but it still won't charge(?)).  
I purchased this item for use while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for $29.00 without tax.  I was told it would work for the LG phones which is what I haveI see now you can no longer find these for sale and gee I wonder why...I probable used this item a total of 8 times when I drove my manual transmission car, I didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic.  The Jabra now does not work...and after only 8 uses, a friend of mine also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well.  While using it the phone cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other end and you have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in, after a while you just give up cause it doesnt work.I emailed the company several times at info@jabra.com but have not tried to call them yet and had no results with the emails.  I have a feeling I lose anyways with this purchase.The thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for LG cell phones, Iknow the one I got with the phone stinks due to the fit but al least it was free and still works top notch.To bad this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived. do not purchase this even for the 4.99 prices you may find it for on Ebay
I got this phone basically for free, but even taking that into account, I'm pretty disappointed with the phone. This is my first Samsung and, I'm pretty sure, my last one! I owned a Nokia before and I regret that I "betrayed" it. From now I wouldn't get anything besides Nokia and in the worst case maybe Sony-Ericsson.So here is a short list of those "little things" that make your life, with this phone (and it's combination with T-Mobile), annoying:- the keys are not comfortable to use.- it's not really comfortable to open/close the slider and to make it easier you have to put your thumb on the screen which leaves is greasy all the time.- putting a comma, while writing a text message, capitalizes the next word - what is the logic in that?! (it annoys me because i do use text messages a lot)- you can't set the camera shutter to be silent...- you can only save 1 phone type for each category - what if the person has 2 business phones...- you cannot choose the e-mail address of a person from the contact list when you want to send a picture message to an e-mail address.And there is a lot more of those little illogical things that were just not thought through, like it would've been in a Nokia (even in a model 5 years old!)Oh yeah, and T-Mobile really "contributed" to the "greatness" of this phone, removing some of the features and limiting others, like setting your mp3 as a ringtone (although, there is an easy hack around it: just change the extension from .mp3 to .3gp
Does not work with Verizon V3C. When I plug the phone in, it says "Unauthorized Charger" and refuses to charge at all. It is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a "charger." I give it one star only because Amazon does not have the option for no stars. If I could, I would give it ZERO stars. I suppose that would be bad for business, but it is what it is. Avoid this cheaply made product and get the real thing. Maybe it works in China, but not in North America
I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!).  There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same).  And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece.  Every one!  It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece.  The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere.  I seriously do not recommend these to anyone
I've previously had subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers, but found I rarely used the number of minutes I was paying for.  A prepaid phone service seemed like the way to go, and STI Mobile sounded like a good alternative because the price was competitive and minutes don't expire.  I signed up and shortly after received my Samsung phone.  It arrived, however, defective - the port for recharging the phone was damaged.  Per the STI Mobile web site, I contacted them within 14 days to arrange for a replacement phone.  This resulted in a number of email exchanges with customer service.  In the first one, the rep told me that I was mistaken, and must have been sent the wrong charger.  No offer was made to replace the charger, strangely, which was included as part of the package deal.  After additional emails where I reassured her that I did in fact have the right charger (I took the phone in to a local merchant, who showed me the charger I was shipped worked with an identical model phone - it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective).  At this point, the rep apologized and told me I would have to contact Samsung for a replacement phone!  This entire process took several weeks.In short, I guess you get what you pay for.  If I had been shipped a working phone STI Mobile probably would have met my needs, but I was turned off by the poor customer service and have since found another prepaid phone provider
I recently purchased this bluetooth Scala-500 and used it all about maybe 5 times.  Why such a short amount of time?  Because the sound quality heard on the other end is so poor that I am told it sounds like I am in a windy tunnel when in fact I am in the car with the windows up and radio off.  It's a bit too hot to drive with air condition off and windows up just so the person on  the other end can hear me.  Now I keep this piece of junk in my console and will only use it if my Logitech bluetooth is out of power.  If you buy this make sure you plan to use it in a place like a library where there are no sounds at all to interfere.  The only good thing about this headset is that it was easy to setup and connects well with my cell phone.  Think twice about buying this product or check it out at your local retailer first.  Even with the rebate I only paid $[...], but still not a bargain.  The one star was for the ease of setting up with my cell phone
I bought this item to protect my new Motorola L6. First of all, it's a cheap piece of plastic... would break if dropped.Second, and more important, MY PHONE DOESN'T WORK WITH IT ON! The plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone, preventing any usage of the entire phone. BEWARE... DON'T BUY
This headset is NOT compatible with the Nokia E62!  The Nokia E62 has a 2.5mm headphone jack and not the pop port shown on this accessory.
This holster offer's your phone ZERO protection.  Not to mention the fact that bumping into something can oftern knock the phone out of the holster.  While it does allow the phone to swivel, thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated, I ended up being the stabbing victim of the belt clip instead.Not to mention the wear and tear from the phone hitting the pavement.All in all, I would NOT recommend this holster.  I'm shopping for a holster and faceplate as we speak..
Samsung A670 is a lame phone. Also, the battery life is not good. It didn't have many features so its just a waste of your money. The Ringtone Volume was too low. I would suggest Samsung improved this phone. I am not sure if i ever want another Samusung again. I have all these samsung accessories and they are in no use they just sitting in the box colleting dust.
My wife and I got two of these phones for "free" when she switched to Cingular. After two weeks, we exchanged her phone for a new one of the same model because it would freeze and drop calls constantly. My phone was fine, but has lately been experiencing the same issues. I know service is not the problem as I had a Samsung phone through Cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas. Sometimes I'll have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to come back.I do not recommend this phone. Even though it is/was free, it's not worth the frustration
Unless you have a CD with a program that is specific to your phone this cable.
I bought this and i have no clue how to sync to my lg cu500 and it dont tell so i wouldnt buy this usb cable, i recommend gettting the one from lg electronics, even though it is more its worth it
This adapter was supposed to charge ww600i as listed , but it did not even fit it . Its totally false information being given for this item ..will never purpchase it from this merchant ever ..cant belive Amazon has these untrustworthy merchants
I bought this USB cable for Cingular my LG CU500 but doesn't work with it. Strongly I don't recommend this others.
Although it's listed under the accessories section for the V66, it is NOT for the V66.  Well, I guess it will work with just the phone, but not the extra battery.  No sense in having this if it doesn't charge the second battery.  I checked it out on the Motorola site, and in fact, it is the wrong one.  This charger is the Motorola SPN5029, which doesn't work with the V66 and 2nd battery.  The correct number is the SPN4970
Thanks God that the phone can survive a moderate fall.  The case pops open very easily AND despite to supposedly snug fit at the time you receive the case, its all loose after that.  Another disappointment, the circular 'knob' that screws into the back of the case that attaches in turn to the belt clip often screws out causing, again you guessed it, falls. 
Maybe it's because this product is not approved for windows, but I couldn't get it to install
The sound is low, static-ky, and it frequently dropped calls. Boo.
You will still need to buy the AC cord for this unit.  This is not a charger.  It's essentially a $30.00 piece of plastic that holds the Q upright. 
Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned
I recived a Blackberry for my birthday in the box the blackberry came in there was a plastic case I tryed to put it on but it wouldnt fit but eventuly it did I tryed to press the enter key but it was covered by the plastic. The reason I gave it a two star was at least it holds it very tight but it makes it impossable to answer a call. I suggest you get a leather on they work alot better
There's nothing &quot;universal&quot; about this product.  It'll split lightweight stuff like cell phones, but don't trust anything more demanding than that with this splitter.  I hooked my laptop up through it and the fuse blew within one second.  Sadly, I'd bought four of these since shipping cost as much as the item itself, and ALL FOUR died when I tried them with my laptop.  The back of the package says not to use items that use over a total of 10amps, which seemed reasonable, so I got out my ammeter and figured out that my laptop used 6amps at most, so not only is this busted, but they lie on the package.  I managed to open up the splitter and put in some more heavy duty wiring and a stronger fuse, and then it worked for a short time until I started smelling plastic melting -- it turns out even one of the springs inside couldn't handle 6amps and heated up enough to disfigure and melt plastic around it.  I give this item two stars only because you might want to plug in two cell phones simultaneously.  For anything else, beware
I got this phone as part of a buy-one-get one free promotion. I changed from Cingular because I couldn't stand my bill being constantly wrong. The i560 seemed like a good choice at first. However, it is not as resilient as advertised. Within the first two months, my phone already malfunctioned. While talking to my wife on the phone, the phone went wacky and the pound sign appeared on my screen. Next, all I could hear was the sound of someone holding down a phone key. I was not even touching the phone. The phone did not respond to any keystrokes or even the command to turn off. Once I removed the battery and placed it back into the phone, the phone restarted and went directly into Airplane Mode. This is the most annyoing features of this phone and I wish you could disable it altogether. My wife's phone had to be replaced by the vendor where we got our phone. Mine is currently on its way to Motorola to be repaired. Caveat Emptor!
If you are buying this to connect to a Nokia phone beware.  It is a non-Nokia part and will no easily interface with the Nokia software.  It uses a different chipset than the Nokia data interface cable, which prevents it from using the standard Nokia drivers.  You may be able to get it working, but I have spent about four hours and have not met with success.  I installed the drivers provided.  I installed Nokia's drivers.  I even installed the PL-2303 serial driver, but I could not make it work.  Also note that this cable is a serial interface.  If converts the USB connection to your computer into a serial port, so you will likely not be happy with the data transfer speed.I would recommend against this purchase.  Spend the extra money and buy the real thing.  You'll save yourself some head aches and heart aches.God bless you
My phone broke after a month or so.  After spending 30 minutes on the phone during which time t-mobile continually wanted to blame me (did you put it in fluorescent light, did you put it in the sun, did you drop it, did you put it in your pocket and bend it, did you put it in your pocket and bump into something, did you drop it, did you break it, did you do something bad to it) they finally relented and agreed to send a new one with the oft repeated comment that if they determined that the phone was damaged then they would charge me untold sums of money.The most amusing part of the conversation went like this:  would you like UPS ground which will take 10 days or UPS 3 day which will cost $15?  When I responded that the ground would be fine she said "OK, that will be $9.95".  I had to laugh at their arrogance.
This device is unusable with a Treo 600.  Every time you try to put the phone in or take it out it pops out the memory card.  Don't waste your money
This headset is uncomfortable to wear but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine. You can also go to an eyewear store and have them do it for you.As for the performance it is great. I drive truck and have a lot of background noise and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and I can hear them just fine also. The volume is great and at times I have to turn it down in volume. Have tried the AnycomHS-890 and this outperforms it hands down. Have had it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the Anycom would at any time. I would definitely  reccommend this headset to anyone in a noisy environment. Very satisified with the performance. Tried to change the rating and seems like can't do that once the review is written. Amazon needs to fix the edit system on this
I bought this item at the end of January and received it in Febuary it is now March and the edges are all turning white and chipping away sorry I bought this I am going to order another color and see if it does the same.  Not very happy with this
I ordered one of these and it was dead on arrival.  Also, notice that this is not a Samsung OEM part.  If you call to ask for tech support from Samsung they will tell you they can't help you.  The only positive thing I have to say is that getting a refund was fairly painless
In the ad, this cable charger claims to sync and charge but will not hotsync to my Treo. It will charge but I already have a home and a car charger so it serves me no purpose. Falsely calims to sync
This review is more about Virgin Mobil customer service than the phone. I ordered a VOX 8610 on 1/22/2007 online thru Virgin Mobile. The phone wouldn't charge. I called customer service and explained the problem. They said did I want a charger or another phone. I replied that I could not tell if it was the charger or the phone that was at fault so please send a new kit.  I received a phone but not a charger and it also wouldn't charge. I called customer service and explained the issue and it must be the charger at fault. The rep said they would not send a new charger, that I would have to purchase one.  I said this didn't make any sense, according to the offer I could return the phone for a full refund and does that mean that to get a new phone and charge  I need to return the phones for a refund and then order another one to get a charger?  The support rep said yes and that I had to make up my mind - either return the phone or purchase a charger.  I asked to speak to a supervisor. The customer support rep kept going off line (to talk to someone?) but refused or couldn't get a supervisor to talk to me.  She then asked for the ESN number of the phone. When I said I didn't know what an 'ESN' number she indignantly explained that it was like a serial number on the back of the phone. I'm not clear why she needed this, since I haven't activated the phone and I already referenced the order (vmu) number.  At any rate I had been on the phone now for over 40 min with the support rep (obviously not very cost effective for virgin mobile) and  at least she was trying to track down some info - or so I thought - she finally came back on line and said that the computer was down and she couldn't handle my order - that I would have to call back.  I called back, had to work my way thru the answering system and got thru to RMA and a fellow named Mike.  Mike  explained that they couldn't send a charger (none in stock) and that I would have to send the entire phone back - which is what I am now doing - 60+ minutes after the initial call. I have to say that my interactions with virgin mobile so far has not been positive. They customer service staff is  obviously  poorly trained and not empowered to make decisions.  The interfaces with support are youth geared - not a bad thing except when it is at the expense of treating adults courteously and professionally.  I am sending the phone back for a refund and re-considering the provider for pay-as-you-go service.   01/26/2007.
I ordered 2 of those which never received and seller never replies emails!Stay away not recommended
Says the USB Data Cable works on a VX8600. No driver was included, and no drivers are available on-line for this.  None of the drivers that came with the package worked, either.As for their return policy, after a couple e-mail exchanges they just sent me an address; they did not comment on paying for shipping or giving me any compensation.  I don't want to wrap something up that I already paid shipping for when it was already an inexpensive item.  Time is money
Palm could not resolve all the issues associated with Treo. I bought this phone few days back and it freezes frequently.
Shouldn't you  people know by now?Say it with me:NEVER BUY MOVIE GAMES.A friend of mine bought it and it was horrible.It was way too easy to die in,etc,etc,etc.Hey listen.Keep you money.Your investment isn't in here
I was really excited when I saw this item was out!  I had the Commodore 64 when I was a kid, and my brother and I used to spend hours and hours playing games on it.  I was so glad to see that Winter Games and Summer Games was included.... until the item arrived and I plugged it in and tried to play with it.. the joystick doesn't work at ALL when you move it to the right.  So, you can only use it to go up down or left. BIG Dissapointment.  Don't waste your $$
SMALL MEMORY WHICH MEANS THAT U CAN ONLY PUT 1 SAVE ON IT SO U HAVE TO RUN BACK TO YOUR COMP EVERYTIME U WANNA SAVE!!! AND SOFTWARE IS VEERY CONFUSING!!! HORRIBLE BUY!!! I RETURNED THE PIECE OF JUNK!!
This is a perfect example of false advertisement. If you're like the many that i've heard of trying to order a remote for the Playstation 2, Don't order this one unless you have a newer model. The picture shows an IR unit but it doesn't come with one. So save yourself the hassle and don't order this
 Ok let me break itdown for you. The Game isn't all thatb great, infact it sucks on ice, but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year. Really you really can't blame them that made this game. The Fact Is 2006 is one of the worst years. there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great. we see about 90% of games and movies arent doing that good. so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the PS3 and the wii comes out. I Promise you that year want disoponte. So dont buy every thing in 06, wait till 07. Dont waiste your mone
Don't buy it unless you want the Starforce malware on your computer.  I understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy, but not at the expense of replacing the drivers I need(ed) for my DVD burner.  Check the search engines and see for yourself.  Would have otherwise been a great game, too bad it isn't playable because of this malware
This game has a good concept, nice graphics, and some definitely funny moments, but the gameplay is a total bore. There are two main gameplay styles: "investigation" and "trial". Investigation is the worst; it involves nothing more than checking everything in a room, talking to everyone, and a ton of pointless reading, much like an old point-and-click adventure on PC. The court sections are a little better, but not much. Once again, it's very linear; you don't have to use your brain much, just try all the options. And once again, there is a huge amount of reading. There is way too much dialogue packed into the game, and not near enough actual gameplay. And most of the talking is aimless, too; very little of it actually advances the plot.Overall, this game just tried way too hard to have good plot and characters, and left the player with little more to do than click on objects and scroll through text
Tediously long and weary. Nothing interesting, just a lot of borrowed ideas from RTCW, HL2, etc. I am sick of this
If you are looking for an XBOX vertsion of another chapter in MechWarrior series, this ISN'T it. This is an extemely dumbed-down version of MW. Even if you (Mechwarrior fans) forget about having no customization, remember this: You can only fire one weapon at at time. You have to cycle between lazers, cannons and rockets. I was bored after about 5 minutes.Again, people who never played MW series may like this game better
I was reading that 8000-word review by Dave Jeanclerc, and I strongly disagree with some of his points.  (P.S. My review has nothing to do with the XBox 360 version, which, apparently, is awesome.)I HAVE PLAYING THE EA FOOTBALL GAMES SINCE THE MID-90'S, and I'm sick of paying $50 for the same game every year.  EA Games owns the rights to the college and NFL teams, so you won't see any football games by any other game companies, most noteably, SEGA, who revolutionized football simulation games in the late 80's.NCAA Football 07 is basically the same as NCAA Football 2002, and 2003, and 2004, and 05 and 06.  Each year, EA adds a little tweak to the mix, but overall, it's the same look, the same feel, the same moves, the same everything.  This year, they've changed the way you kick the ball, and added more defensive audibles--that's it.  There are a few other minor adjustments, but none are worth noting IMO.  In fact, the audibles they added are the EXACT SAME audibles you used to have on Sega's ESPN Football 2005--you can call audibles for individual defensive players.  Thieves.  Everything else is THE EXACT SAME AS 05 and 06.  The most disappointing thing, graphically speaking, is the crowd...it still looks like flat rows of objects moving in unison, just like it did on games made 10 years ago.OH--one other big change...the "improved" momentum meter.  If you thought it was ridiculous last year, wait til you play NCAA 07.  The "momentum meter" has such a strong influence on the game, that if you make ONE OFFENSIVE MISTAKE in the beginning of the game, you're doomed...that's it.  You can't win.  For example--I played FSU vs. UM twice.  The first time, I made no 1st half errors, and pounded the Hurricanes 31-10.  I played with the same exact settings in the same stadium again, and purposely fumbled the opening kickoff, giving the Hurricanes the ball at my 35 yd. line, and I lost the game 45-24.  That fumble was my ONLY MISTAKE of the game.NESSLER, HERBSTRIET AND CORSO ARE STILL MAKING THE SAME EXACT IN-GAME COMMENTS THEY WERE SAYING IN 05 AND 06...GIMME A BREAK!!!!  Also, the AI is still atrocious.  Defensively, the computer controlled team is hapless.  They blitz on every down.  In fact, I've lined up numerous times for a 3rd and long with 4 or 5 receivers, and the defense continually loads 8 men in the box...they don't even put enough DB's out there to stop me.  It's basically a game of long bombs.  If you choose a team with good receivers, you can easily throw for 400+ yards a game by continually going deep.  THE SAFETIES ALWAYS BLITZ!!!  The safeties only drop back into coverage if you have 3rd and 20+, or 4th and 15+.  So how does the computer couteract your deep balls?  Easy--when the momentum meter swings against your favor, your receivers drop EVERY BALL YOU THROW AT THEM, (even if you hit them in the chest with the ball) and when you finally decide to run the ball, your RUNNING BACK FUMBLES THE BALL IMMEDIATELY.  I played a game between USC and Cal, and I kept switching to play with the team that DIDN'T have the momentum, and I ended up turning the ball over on every possession.You may be reading this and saying, "Hey--this guy has played this game a lot to figure all of this out."  No, not really--it's exactly how I've played the 05 and 06 game, and the same "glitches" I've encountered in them, too.  EA has really dropped the ball again.  You are paying $50 to get updated rosters, and, in typical EA fashion, you don't even have names for any of the players--just different skill levels.EA games suck.  Their soccer games are horrible, their basketball games are too slow and awkward, and they don't update their football games.  I GUARANTEE YOU THAT MADDEN 07 WILL BE THE SAME AS MADDEN 06...JUST WATCH.And by the way--EA has gone all-out on the XBox 360 editions of NCAA 07 ans Madden 07...I'm sure those versions will be stunning.  The rest of us are paying the same price for last year's game
Being a Starsky and Hutch fan since I was a kid, I was looking forward to playing this. The graphics are &quot;cartoon&quot; horrible and the need for &quot;VR&quot; points becomes annoying after awhile. The bad guys are like something from a Chinese Kung Fu movie, you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them...and that's with playing with a PS2 gun (I can't imagine shooting with a controller) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on &quot;VR&quot; points. The dialog gets annoying too and you can't skip hearing it either
First off i just want to say that i've read "The Secret of the Old Clock" and it made this game even more boring because i knew the basic outline.I see in an above review an adult of the age 35 loved it, which i can understand. But I'm 15 and i found this game OVERLY boring. The puzzles were way too easy, and driving around in the horribly done car part of the game made me want to quit playing. It says youll get a pay if you do some chores for people...i didnt get anything. Although I love herinteractive and and i love all the other nancy drew games i would highly reccomend you dont waste $19.00 on it. I would only reccomend getting it if it was in a value pack of Nancy Drew games
My daughter and I have played all of the previous games; we've enjoyed them overall.  Some of the games are fantastic, challenging and fun. This game was quite lame in comparison to the others.  The puzzles weren't really puzzling, just boring tasks.  There were not many clues to find.  Because there weren't many clues, there was no real sense of detecting anything.  The game ended abruptly and was very short.  We did NOT use a walk-through to solve the mystery in record time, just experienced a lack of challenge.  We did like the newness of becoming Frank and Joe Hardy occasionally.  The rest was pretty boring.  If you are looking for a Nancy Drew game, try one of the others instead
This GameCube is WEAK. I have owned both the NES and the Nintendo 64 and those were excellent gaming systems. Nintendo's recent system, the GameCube, has several problems with it's design. First of all, the internal fan is slow but, quiet. After an hour or so of use, the system overheats, thus shuts down. Second problem, the wireless controllers for this system SUCK. We have tried 4 brands and none have worked more than a week. The brands we have tried: Pelican, Intec, Nintendo, and Osmart. The third problem is that the system was not built to last. I still have the NES and Nintendo 64, which both work great! I doubt the GameCube will last past 4-5 years of use. Simply put, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! ALSO! The Nintendo Wii is going to come out soon. From the description and from the specs, you will need to stand up and interact (move around and stuff) with the game. Sounds fun but, would you like to do that after a hard day of work? It will work something like the Sony Eye Toy.
After playing this game for the third time I had a thought, 'WHY DID I BUY THIS!' This game is extremely unoriginal and gets boring very quickly. I cannot notice any difference and improvements from the first ballers and other NBA Street's. Save your money and do not purchase this dreadful game
Like the other reviews, I find this game a rip-off of Caesare III. (I didn't know there was a IV! Must look into that.) While the graphics are admirable, the gameplay wasn't challenging at all. It didn't take me any time at all to win, and I'm one of the worst game players ever. OTOH, it's a good afternoon waster if all you want to do is build and perfect your city in open play with no goals. Don't buy it now. Wait until it's cheap, like $9.95 or something.
Please promise me you will never play this.  It is not worth your time.  If you paid money for it, try to find the person you gave that money to and kick them in the shin.  Hard.  Then throw your copy of this game in the dumpster.Seriously though, this game is absolutely terrible.  The graphics are bad even for the PSX, the combat quickly becomes boring as all hell, the story line was confused and the fact that there was a second dimension pointless.  There was no reason for there being 40 something characters, most of them were exactly the same statwise, and all of them were poorly designed.  The most annoying thing in the world, bar nothing, is having to re-equip all your character's spells whenever you switch characters.  You have like 50 spell slots.  God.  I don't think I even need to say it, but those crumbums at Square couldn't pull another hit out of their oversized victorian tophats if they wanted too.  They should really stick with straight to video Final Fantasy 7 anime movies from now on, lest they risk making something like this again
AVOID THIS PRODUCT, wait till PS3 with it's Hard drive an hope something better will come out.Memory cards are flash memory an flash memory is FRAGILE, one whoops an it's destroyed.Damn to hell Sony for making us pop 25 bucks a memory card in the first place.BAD:STAY AWAY FROM MAX MEMORY MANAGER... DO NOT LOAD GAME SAVES FROM THE INTERNET ONTO YOUR MEMORY CARDS. IT WILL CORRUPT AN DESTROY YOUR MEMORY CARD/CARDS. One memory card is worth more than this stupid thing. I lost two memory cards an ALL my bazillion hours of gameplay. ALSO... the disc sucks, when the PS2 is warm, it won't recognize the disc & if you break or mess the disc up, no way you can make a copy of it an use that. Your screwed!GOOD:The codes work an it's great to whip through a game that was driving you nuts or stressing you out before.If you have complaints, call Datels US office(727) 431-065
I was not able to get the original intercooler to work on my system. I sent it back and got another one. The second intercooler did not work either. It makes a nice paperweight!
I agree with other reviewers that the graphics and vocals are good, but I find the gameplay itself less than stellar. For starters, I've always been irritated with games that don't let you save your status whenever you want. Sometimes I just want to get in a quick dose of gameplay, but that's not possible with these games that require you to play through an entire section before being allowed to save.  That contributes to the repetitive, tedious nature of some sections. If you get stuck getting through a certain bit of the game, you're doomed to replay much of what led up to it over and over again.I realize that tricky camera angles are some of the challenges that are supposed to exist in this game. More than in the earlier versions, however, I have trouble getting myself lined up for whatever task. Another tedious element.I found this game to be more a test of my endurance and patience than actual fun
how many RPG's can this world make??  they're all the same.  open this container, take weapons and health kits from this dead body, use this spell.. KOTOR is no different, sadly.  the combat IMHO is just really boring.  when you see an enemy, the screen freezes and you decide ahead of time your first moves to make.  if that doesn't kill the enemy, your character automatically does standard attacks unless you pause the game and set up your next moves.  umm, how many times has this been done before?  if i wanted that, i could have bought final fantasy 129 or whatever number they're on now.  all of the enjoyment is taken out of using things like blaster rifles and light sabers.  it's the same idea as using your shovel or something in nethack (look it up).  the good thing about games like everquest and world of warcraft is that they took the stale old RPG formula and did something new with it. 
As others have said, this was a much-anticipated game. I played Caesar II and III and was extremely excited when I heard that IV was coming out. What a letdown! I didn't have any of the installation errors that others have mentioned, and I haven't had the game crash on me. However, the game is unplayable on my system - which is only a year old - unless I turn down 90% of the advanced graphics. By "unplayable", I mean ten seconds or more of waiting between the time you click with your mouse, and when the game responds. Even with the graphics turned down, I still get lag when the auto-save starts. As mouse-control is essential when building roads or aquaducts, this is aggravating in the extreme.It appears that Sierra's programmers and designers put a lot of work into upgrading the graphics. Too bad I can't see them!The interface is horrible and takes up the right half of the screen at 1280x1024 resolution. This means that you must rotate the map to build along the right edge. I much prefer the "tabbed" building interface of the other city-building games.Although you can build roads along the diagonals in this game - which you couldn't in earlier versions - the interface is not smart enough to auto-rotate the buildings to fit along the roads. You have to click and drag to rotate buildings, and lag - even at the low graphics settings - can make this an exercise in frustration.I dislike the new warehouse management panel. The sliders might look cool, but they're slow (lag!). I would've liked to see additional options for "only store basic goods", "only store luxury goods", etc. This would take some of the pain out of managing them. Trade ports are different also - you can't see prices!It appears that some of the scenarios have hidden milestones that you have to meet in order to advance. In the one I'm playing right now, I'm stuck because my prosperity rating will not rise above 36 (50 required to win). I have over 30,000 denarii in my treasury, and have been turning a hefty profit (and meeting various demands from Rome) for at least eight years of game-time. I have met and exceeded all other requirements for victory, but prosperity continues to elude me. My city is almost completely automated by now - the only thing I do is respond to Rome's requests for goods or cash. My advisors have nothing helpful to say. It's not fun if I can't advance.So while the game is pretty - from what I can see of it - it's got too many frustrations to be worth much more of my time
Easy...Boring...Bugs, bugs, bugs, glitches, glitches, glitches...Question??? Is this a new game, or possible bonus maps from CoD2 that they decided to make into a new game to profit more money????  Hmmmm??? The positive?? You can cook your grenades now. I like mine medium rare... Possibly useful in online matches, as apposed to CoD2 where you couldn't and it was point less to throw a grenade in online matches because you knew where it was and could just move. But I will never know, because I "thankfully" rented the damn thing, and didn't buy it. Wait, I didn't my dad did, on a free rental from Blockbuster. So they didn't get any of my hardly earned money. Good for me...Also could anyone tell me why I kept getting stuck on walls, tanks, people, just about everything. I think I was stuck in the air... If you like this game, you need to get the F**k out, and buy something else to play, that I have so I can meet up with you and beat you... Also, if you don't like my run on sentences you can.... Yep you guess it... Get the f**k out.
Really? Wow. So, players in real football go through other players torso's? They skate and glide around the field at 40MPH without moving their legs? WR's change direction on one foot, pivot, glide and elude tackles? Uh, ok.Anyone who plays this game on the All-madden level will notice right away that this is the furthest thing from a realistic football game.What are the nerds at EA thinking? Do they ENJOY making a game who's AI constantly cheats? I love how they tout games that "give the user more control" when the user has very LITTLE CONTROL over anything that goes on in the game. I don't control if I catch it or drop it, or intercept it, or if my line blocks, of if my DB's cover their assignment...none of it. The COMPUTER makes my line miss blocks or not block at all...drop easy picks...drop easy catches, etc. And why, oh why, are DT's and LB's faster than my fastest WR? Is THAT realistic? The AI is terrible. It blatantly and UNrealistically cheats.Terrible game. Just stop making these games if this is your final product
First, let me say that I whole-hearedly agree with the review by Tiberius. Back in the glory days of Counter-Strike (2001-2002), this game was the be-all end-all for 1) Online video games, 2) First-Person Shooters, 3) PC Games, and 4) Any video game basically. It had real-life weapons, the graphics were superb at the time, the maps were extremely well-made, the system requirements are still obscenely low, and damnit it was fun. Then, inevitabely, the hands of time began to take their ruthless, indiscriminate toll. Video cards supported better graphics, new (and yes, better!) games came out (Battlefield 1942, Unreal Tournament 2004), hacking became the unmistakable poison of Counter-Strike, and a lot of the cool, casual gamers grew up or moved on. From 2000 to 2004, Counter-Strike went from an utter joy to a sensation to a fading diamond to a nuisance. By 2004 to present day, it has become a problem. Great games and great game developers are losing tons of money because people are still playing this game after five years on their mom's worn-out 640 Megahertz Pentium III PCs running Windows 98. Counter-Strike is still one of the most popular games of all-time, with a ridiculous number of people playing it on average a day, because people just don't seem to have enough self-control to give up their hopeless addiction.Today, server admins are, for the most part, humorless dictators, and will not stand for anything that deviates from this game's undeniable, monotonous drone. People are still playing the same maps from the 1.0 release, that have completely lost all their zest and initial potential. It always feels as if I've played the same round a thousand times before, and I probably have. Even the custom maps are sickening in their monotony. fy_iceworld is fun for 3 consecutive seconds. Many other popular custom maps in heavy server rotation are the same way, and all look disguisting. I've played on probably over 500 servers, and downloaded probably over the same amount of *quality* custom maps, and not more than 3 have I ever seen a server run in its rotation, or voted on by the players. Furthermore, people are still playing the game using dial-up, and CS veterans are always complaining about camping, even if its a tactic used to complete the objective. As far as the objectives are concerned, Counter-Strike has basically become a deathmatch game. No one will listen to anyone's plan (on the rare occasion there is one), no one tries to rescue the hostages, and everyone always calls someone a "p***y" or "nub" if you use the auto shotgun or AWP. And to top it all off, Valve cancelled the outstanding won.net and replaced it with this Steam garbage, a utility soaking wet with incompetence.L337 Speak has also gained mass popularity to the jaded Counter-Strike culture, and has become its own incessant frustration. But I won't even get into that. If you're new to CS, don't bother, veterans of this game are far from friendly, and you'll probably get called a bunch of names involving lots of zeroes and threes if you're a beginner. For now, if you want to indulge yourself in a great online game, check out World of Warcraft, Battlefield 1942, Sven Co-Op, or even Team Fortress Classic (a dated game with an *awesome* community that has yet to lose its initial charm)
This game has a good concept, nice graphics, and some definitely funny moments, but the gameplay is a total bore. There are two main gameplay styles: "investigation" and "trial". Investigation is the worst; it involves nothing more than checking everything in a room, talking to everyone, and a ton of pointless reading, much like an old point-and-click adventure on PC. The court sections are a little better, but not much. Once again, it's very linear; you don't have to use your brain much, just try all the options. And once again, there is a huge amount of reading. There is way too much dialogue packed into the game, and not near enough actual gameplay. And most of the talking is aimless, too; very little of it actually advances the plot.Overall, this game just tried way too hard to have good plot and characters, and left the player with little more to do than click on objects and scroll through text
OK, so where the heck is Vince Young, Matt Leinart, and Reggie Bush in this version?  You see Reggie Bush on the cover, so you think you're going to get the opportunity to play with the Heisman Trophy winner, pair him up with Lendale White and Matt Leinart, and take on the Longhorns to try and replay the Rose Bowl.  But none of these players are to be found.  In fact, Ohio State is listed as the #1 team.Am I behind the times?  Or is this how EA Sports does their football games?  Do I need to buy NCAA 06 in order to use these players in their prime?  I was hoping to be able to play them with updated "abilities" that would reflect all of their outstanding years in 2005.Any ideas out there?  Is this a code or a "cheat" I need to unlock?HELP!!
this game is really bad I mean everything about it. they took so long to make this and for what.its just a waste off time and your money I gave it 1star because the guns are the best thing about this crap gam
Such great visuals and I love most of the Star Wars RPG/Shooters, BUT, I cant believe this is a point and click game.  I was hoping KOTOR2 would have implimented a normal battle engagement.  Theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during an intense battle and actually having to turn around, click the target, then engage someone else after the kill.  The days of Boulder's Gate point-n-click should be over, but I guess theres a crowd for this type of gameplay.  Still a good game, but dissapointed
This remote is of awful quality; i've been through two of them in the past year. I wouldn't complain so much if it didn't cost $30! It's worth ten, at most. Most people would be better off buying a cheap DVD player, rather than using the xbox
I love the idea behind this game and it's pretty impressively exectuted. I had three gripes though: 1) It's so fast paced that I found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure. 2)I couldn't get the magnify and reduce (with quick little circles) to work.  This caused me great frustration. 3)There's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times.I quit playing it pretty quickly
I got this game during the summer expecting it to be great fun. Well...it caught my interest for a few weeks then I just got bored with it. I'd only recomend it to people who do not get bored easily
poor quality ,out of box you can only play KQ7. almost useless very dispointed that they even sell this game as it is
Hey, have you ever played Caesar II from the 1990s? Yeah, well this game is basically a knock-off of that game with better graphics. And quite frankly, Caesar II was more fun. I don't see how CivCity has any point. You build your city and nothing interesting ever happens. There is no progression to the game that keeps it fresh. The makers intergrated technologies and wonders from the successful Civilization game series, but they are inconsequential in this game. These people should stick to what they are good at, the Civilization series, and leave city games to people who know how to do it. I've heard that a new installment of the Caesar series is out now, Caesar IV, and I haven't tried it, but it has to be better than CivCity Rome. This game is boring, don't pay any money for it.
Bought this game on the strength of some reviews here but I was very dissapointed with it. Clunky control system really put me off
This game looked so crazy I couldn't resist it.  I mean Disney and Squaresoft trying to merge Final Fantasy and a load of Disney cartoons must have seemed like a cool idea in Japan since they love cartoons so much, but in the USA it's just insane.  On top of that you have voice talents from Mandy Moore to Lance Bass, and as production values go you knew you had to be in for one of most ridiculous games in history.   Hardcore fans were bothered that this looked like a kids' game but aren't games supposed to be aimed at children and teens anyway?I was ultimately disappointed with Kingdom Hearts.  The world and characters of Kingdom Hearts is not really about a Final Fantasy Disney crossover it's just a place for the kids you control to have out their little melodrama.  It's like the idea of Disney meets Final Fantasy just takes a back seat.  Once you get past all the hype Kingdom Hearts is boring and frustrating.  A nagging issue is the tiny areas in this game.  "Planet Alice in Wonderland" consists of four small rooms of course you will spend a great deal of time in them fighting off monsters.  The combat is a blend of chaotic button mashing and watching your party members act like total fools until they die.  The worst of it is respawning monsters, you can't take a step without having to fight and re-fight hoards of shadow munchkins that you had just defeated.  Because of this you'll spend the majority of your money on healing items.  Bosses are a nightmare since they are hard to survive and take forever to kill (30 minutes is normal.)  Since combat is so simple it really makes the drawn out battles beyond boring.  After beating 2 bosses I was done with this game.  I know that Kingdom Hearts 2, Mushashi Samurai Legend, and Final Fantasy 13 all have the same combat woes.  I wish Squaresoft would learn that respawning enemies and bosses with 9 million hit points are a thing of the past
this game is just the original + a crappy beam system where you spin to the right when you lock beams and the gamplay is totally repetitive also their isnt any in game transforming at ALL!! i hate this game so MUCH!! it is literally the worst DBZ game i have ever played {and i have played them all) i advise you if ur looking for a new DBZ game wait for the next one because their shure isnt anything new here but a crappy beam system. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVER!!!!
I actually recieved this from a friend of mine, which he bought for $0.98. Anyway, I said that there were television shows that I thought were interesting, but were only sold over in the UK (and so on). He told me that the AR MAX was a REGION X DVD reader. So, I took it home, and decided on buying a TV series that was a Region 2, and just recieved it today, to my surprise (not actually) the damn thing didn't work. Now I'm stuck with a Region 2 DVD with nothing to play it in. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT! If you are buying this for the reason that it reads other Regions of DVD's...DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is junk. However, I am thankful that I didn't even buy this product, but it was given to me. I hope that someone planning on buying this, reads my review first. IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY
I had this in my cart and just "Thought" it sounded like a useful tool to protect my investment. I cannot thank ALL of you who were honest and told me what damage this could do.Thank you all again! mckinle
This game is a joke!  It is immpossible for a child to get past level 3.  It took my husband about 20 tries to get past it, and he is a pro at video games.  (he beat mech 2 for x-box and halo2 the third time he played them.)  Don't buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out.  It is was a waste of money my kids won't even play it.  It should be rated N for Nobody
I purchased this game when it was new, and my computer while meeting the requirements just couldn't run it. I put he game in a box and just a month ago found it again. The computer I have now should be able to run the game thrice simultaneously with all options on highest settings. Yet the game will randomly crash and cause my computer to restart and losing my 4mins to 2 hours work. I contacted tech support and got what I am now sure are just something for me to try until I quit trying and leave them alone. It worked. They win. They got my money and I got jack
If you are looking for codes like Game Shark had, this is not for you.  Not only do you HAVE to have a computer, If anything happens to the disk, you are screwed.  You won't be able reinstall windows, or install it on a new computer.  Some games do offer rewards like unlimited health for %100 completion.  So if those are they games you plan on using,  this is the best thing out there
how many RPG's can this world make??  they're all the same.  open this container, take weapons and health kits from this dead body, use this spell.. KOTOR is no different, sadly.  the combat IMHO is just really boring.  when you see an enemy, the screen freezes and you decide ahead of time your first moves to make.  if that doesn't kill the enemy, your character automatically does standard attacks unless you pause the game and set up your next moves.  umm, how many times has this been done before?  if i wanted that, i could have bought final fantasy 129 or whatever number they're on now.  all of the enjoyment is taken out of using things like blaster rifles and light sabers.  it's the same idea as using your shovel or something in nethack (look it up).  the good thing about games like everquest and world of warcraft is that they took the stale old RPG formula and did something new with it. 
i am a huge spyro fan, i have been playing since the first one, which was great, the second one better, the third one, ok, forth one What happened!! this one, after purchasing mine from amazon cheaply for something like 5 i regret doing so, it was a waste of money seen as the whole game is a bit repetative and frustrating, you never seem to get anywhere. all the voices have changed. if you are a series gamer and enjoyed the origional spyro games, dont buy this and dont be disapointed. however i would say that if you are under 12 you would probably very much enjoy the game
I bought this game on a whim, having really liked Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. This game needs help. First of all, the frame rate is lower than it should be. There is slow-down as well. Even the game before this, Need For Speed: Underground 2 looked 100 times better. The car models in Most Wanted are a touch nicer-looking and there is a far better selection than Underground 2, but that's the only plus this game has to it. You don't race as much as fly around the city in a barely-controlled frenzy, trying to stay ahead of the computer cars. Winning is more by luck than skill. He or she who hits the least obstacles wins. Hardly an enjoyable way to race! I get too stressed when playing this game, so I put it away for a while. Definitely rent before buying this game.
I'd like to give this game a good review, but unless you read the fine print, you may be as dissapointed as I was to discover that it doesn't work on LCD televisions.  It also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets
The movie is a about a guy, who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that. That's pretty much the whole story. Well, the idea is quite powerful but not new, the characters are done in the "comics" style and very primitive, the jokes are quite boring. Actually what is really amazing, that it could've been ok to watch as a family movie, but a few really tasteless jokes made it PG13 rated without adding any fun, so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids.Too boring for adults, not appropriate for kids, too much moral for young crowd - I can't really think who might like it
This DVD is very cheesy and I am sorry I bought it.
Cheesy instructorthe instructor's voice covers the music in the background which turns you off going on with the exercize, the music itself is monotonous and the beat is not inline with the moves. the instructor is too fast to follow..to cut it short i do not recommend this for anyone ..totally not professional
I saw this movie years ago, but didn't remember much about it, except some of the songs, and the basic story.  I also saw "Nights of Cabiria", from which the story was taken. I love musicals, and I think Shirley MacLaine is very talented.  She is very sweet as Charity Hope Valentine, and one can't help wanting a happy ending for her.  So why did I think this movie was awful? First of all, some of the dialogue was so repetitious it became irritating-- how many times can you listen to Charity say "Fickle finger of fate" over and over without wanting to hit the mute button?  Also, some of the scenes went on and on and on-- especially the elevator scene.  And-- the intermission was totally unnecessary. But the worst disappointment for me was the musical numbers. I didn't like any of them--- they were so far over the top as to be silly.  Bob Fosse must have thrown everything into them that he could--- instead of letting the dancers and the songs carry the numbers, he had so much busyness in all of them-- too many people, costumes that didn't fit the story, silly moves-- and they all went past the point of enjoyment.  I fast forwarded thrua couple of them just to get them over with.  I have never done that before with any movie. This could have been so much better-- the story was good, the charactors were good-- but the whole thing should have been toned down. The movie could have been 30 minutes shorter if there had been some trimming. It was entirely too long.   Also--- all that stop action-- what was that all about? I know, I know-- it was to show the progress of the story, but it was a distraction.I didn't like the movie and was glad when it was over.
If there ever was a movie more hyped in 2005 it was "History of Violence" On critics top ten list, everyone was talking about the performances of Viggo and Maria and Ed, so I went into it with high expectations. Honestly it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't worth all the worship that the Hollywood community and critics heaped upon it either. The story of a humble family man in a small town who thwarts two cold blood murderers, only to be visited afterwards by his past in the shape of Ed Harris , who in my opinion had the best performance overall. Ed (Mr. Fogarty) is in the Mob and seems to think that Viggo (Tom) is Joey Cusack a former mobster who went missing after killing his friends and wounding his eye and now he wants revenge. Tom, and his wife Edie (played by Maria Bello) have two children, a farmhouse, and a diner and Tom insist that he isn't Joey. The story goes on, dragging and dragging with tiny spots of violence and sex. Maria Bello has never been one of my favorite actresses, I think her acting ability is a natural as her blonde hair (evidence is in the movie) she brings the level of believability down and makes Viggo's performance seem like he is trying to make up for her lack of talent. We soon figure out that Tom is indeed Joey and after we say goodbye to Ed Harris's character (of which I was just disappointed to see, c'mon he was awesome!) Tom/Joey goes to see his brother, Richie (William Hurt) to make amends for disappearing, and soon realizes that Richie wants him dead. So more killing, more blood, and tom/joey is finally free of his past, if his family would take him back. Of course they do, really, his redemption is yawn worthy set around a dinner table (his daughter sets a place for him...) and the movie is over. There was no Aha moment, the action wasn't anything new, the story was predictable and the setting was "been there done that". Viggo is an amazing actor, and if there had been a better script he might have come across as more tortured and the Tom/Joey duality could have come off as truly horrific to change back into, the shift of reality was barely noticeable. Maria Bello, needs to stop being cast in these dramatic roles where she is some tough, sexy, stringy haired ball breaker who is kinda motherly, it doesn't work for her, she cannot pull it off. So I don't recommend this movie, its slow, its disappointing and its not all it was cracked up to be
I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone. Due to a high content of bad words, screaming and violence, it's kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else. Some people really enjoyed it, and that's not me, and that's not the other two people I know who watched it. Some violent parts are a bit hard to believe, but I guess that's what the story is about. This movie is a bit of a hollywood-style suspense, with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies. There's one good idea in this movie and that's how life develops as it goes along, and one action or inaction changes how life plays out. But this is no where near original, even the Simpsons had an episode like that. So, this movie is definitely not on my best movies list.
The movie is one of my favorites, works on both a romantic level, and a comic level.  But where's the widescreen?  Todays consumers are more educated (THANK GOD) and they've almost stopped asking the stupid question "Why watch widescreen, you lose the top and bottom of the movie?!"  They finally get that you are seeing MORE of the movie with widescreen and not less.  So how can I be expected to buy this DvD?  It is for all intents and purposes "Incomplete".  Who's going to pay for all of something and be satisfied with only getting some of it?  Buy this movie as soon as WS version becomes availible
recent scholarship has determined the chinese invented the lightbulb in 1800 bc, the internal combustion engine in 2200 bc, and established a world wide grid of radio communication satellites in 650 ad.all this without any systematic mathematics.hurrah for the chinese.  alas, like the records of the above globe trotting oriental sailor, all the information and data concerning said miracles of intellectual invention have disappeared, somewhere either burnt, or submerged in tar.  but speculation continues.  meanwhile, spaghetti was invented there, without which no italy would have arisen.  oh, and crackers, they invented crackers, and bed posts first
Perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of Lincoln's various works, such as The Sacred Place, The Messianic Legacy, and Holy Blood, Holy Grail, or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books. The DVD will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books. However, it is simply not successful as a stand-alone video or as a video about The Da Vinci Code. The narrator, Mr. Lincoln, takes us through the quaint and beautiful countryside of the Languedoc, home to the Cathar heresy and the Albigensian Crusade, and points out some interesting details in his wandering. Yet he rarely ties the details together into a coherent picture, and often makes comments that would seem to undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent picture. As well, he relishes in showing the destruction wrought to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and vandals (many inspired, it would seem, by Lincoln's books) and repeatedly editorializes against their actions. I finally fell asleep at around the 90 minute mark---I cannot imagine what else Mr. Lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining half hour.    
Jeez, maybe I am getting old, but I really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest.  A brilliant scientist.  Disfigured.  Angry.  Finds temporary techie fix for face.  Goes to get bad guys.  Fighting.  More fighting.  Still more fighting.  Ex mate learns he's alive.  He leaves her anyway (he's too ugly).  The end.  More to come, if successful.  Not recommended
I was so disappointed in this film. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the heart and soul Terrance Howard put into his acting. I love Terrance, he is an outstanding actor but seeing him playing a pimp was just embarrassing. He did an excellent job with the acting but I would have much rather seen him portraying Marvin Gaye. Call me naive but is pimping still actually going on in Memphis, Tennessee in this day and time? And did Terrance Howard give Ludacris' character a cassette tape to listen to? Not a CD, a tape. I probably would have flushed it down the toilet too. And the hook to that song, "You know it's hard out here for a pimp." Ya think? With prostitution being illegal in the state of Tennessee and all. I found myself cringing and sliding down in my seat in the theatre when she began to sing because I was so embarrassed. Don't get me wrong, I love my black people but sometimes when we get a chance to make a major motion picture we just don't quite bring it, do we? "The Cookout" "How High?" "Girl 6" "Woo" "Kingdom Come" Now we can add "Hustle and Flow" to the list. I'm glad Terrance Howard redeemed himself in "Crash." Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.
About the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music. The producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who's not screwed-up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick, incestuous, and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in. If you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood, don't watch this
It is obvious that this movie is full of lies.  Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!).  The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable.  Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying.  The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael!  And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank.  Bravo to those who figured that out.  Also, Michael Moore is fat.  Take that Pinkie
It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others.The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.  The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.  Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful!Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland.Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on.As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all.Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE!Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here.If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man.
It has been a long time since I read the novel upon which this book is based, but I do clearly remember it making sense.  This movie doesn't even make sense (to quote a chicken I know).  Marlon Brando somnambulizes his way through the film and, instead of coming off as sinister, menacing, and dominating, he makes Dr. Moreau into a joke.  Val Kilmer's portrayal is vacuous and silly.  Is the character supposed to be under the influence?  I guess he wanted it portrayed that way.  The script?  Is there one?  Moreau talks about having almost reached his goal.  Where?  His one "son" and his "daughter" do have some fine traits, but both are also pretty ineffectual.Several reviews have mentioned the special effects.  I actually saw very few special effects.  The rat-people on the boat were creepy and well-done, and some of the characters did make some superhuman moves, but mostly I saw people in very elaborate, well-done costumes, using well-distorted voices.The central character, played by David Thewlis, should have been the focus of the movie, as he is the narrator.  He kept getting lost in the shuffle, and I kept waiting for him to see things that I saw, and to ask the questions that I would have asked.  I like him as an actor, but this is certainly not a memorably good performance.  It is somewhat ironic that he is the witness to animal-human hybrid horror here, but is the werewolf in "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."The film does create a sense of the nightmare.  Several of the characters do show glimpses of depth and genuineness, most notably Ron Perlman's preacher, but then he's well-practiced, from his "Beauty and the Beast" television series.  That was what (barely) earned this film its second star.  Let's vote them all off the island, and start over.  Robert Duvall as Moreau?  Replace Kilmer with Matt Damon?  Casey Affleck replacing David Thewlis
"Modigliani" (2004) is a self-indulgent, pretentious and largely fictional portrait of a tragic artist. Writer-director Mick Davis goes overboard on the symbolism while revealing precious little about the man and his work. Ironically, the viewer has a better understanding of Pablo Picasso than Amedeo Modigliani. Despite his boundless enthusiasm, Andy Garcia is simply too old for the title role. An irritating fiasco that deserved its straight-to-video fate
I bought this DVD to replace a worn Video from the BBC(British Broadcasting Commission). It was a bit of a shock. The original film has been edited and chopped up with bits of rubbish added through. It also now has a poor voice over. The whole feel of the film has been removed. All the PBS...and viewers like your rubbish? Where'd that come from. It was totallly funded via the BBC. The PBS editions mess up may have been funded by someone else. My copy is going Free as I won't be watching it again.Sincerely, do yourself a favour and source out a BBC edition. I give it (5 Stars)It is an awesome package. Inspiring and well told. Something to watch again and again(Hence I've worn out the video cassette
Absolutely unwatchable. Cliche-ridden. So silly it's very nearly offensive. It's like watching one long music video by a B-level rapper - full of dumb, beautiful women, buff, monkey-headed ghetto thugs, and jokey tricked-out cars. Without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is laughable, the acting worse. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are more "Dumb and Dumber" than "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid". Awful
The so-called humor in this embarrassingly awful and unfunny movie is so uncreative and moronic.  It is apparently for a demographic of viewers with an extremely childish sense of humor.  A three year old will laugh at anything.  Every turn of the plot is stupid.  This is in the running for the worst movie ever made.  I don't trust the taste of anyone who actually was impressed by this horse manure.  I hope that Bruce Willis would have the class to turn down a role like this if he was offered it now.  I think he is a very good actor.  It's a shame what kind of garbage he had to be in, to get his career going
AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I bought this for a little over $15 at another store and returned it within a week...Horrible transfer (if it were ALPHA video i wouldn't care, but come on...this is a major DVD company we're talking about, SONY!!!!!). Aspect ratio isnt the theatrical format, but rather PAN AND SCAN cropped sides bulls#it. Plus its missing like 20 minutes! I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. Just the thought of this release makes me angry (to the point of inarticulate). AVOID AVOID AVOID! and write a letter to your congressman (ha!)...or perhaps SONY/MGM. This release is inexcusable
P.S. has potential. Both Grace and Linney are great in it, but midway through the movie loses its mystic and gets boring. It's a shame because it could've been a great movie. Great acting with a bland plot
I'm going to have to disagree with the majority of the reviews on this movie. I have seen plenty of Russian films, and many of them have been slow and entirely reliant upon the emotional component. Mikhalkov, for example, is a director who can do this. This movie suffers from pretentious screenwriting, and a lack of underlying meaning or moral lesson. although the acting isn't necessarily bad, you don't get attached to the characters. I got the feeling that the cinematography and the colors didn't match the movie's theme and plot. At times it got so boring that i wanted to stop watching, even though i never do that. Anyway, I do not recommend this movie. IF you want to watch some good russian movies, go with "Brother", "Burnt By The Sun", "Prisoner of THe Mountains", "War", or "Unfinished Piece for the Mechanical Piano
I rented this movie for about six dollars and I have to say even that was a waste of money. I thought this movie was incredibly over acted, boring and hard on the eyes. The thing that annoyed me the most was the monologues that each of the main characters did. They were exaggerated and reminded me of the kind of acting you would find in a infomercial. For the superficial people out there I wouldn't watch this movie hoping for eye candy because you won't get it. When I found out that the two women starring actually wrote and directed the film it finally made sense why the acting was so horrible. I have no idea why this movie has any stars at all it was horrible and that would be considered a compliment
GA. how can anyone stand this drivel? worst movie i ever watched repeatedly. worse than watching "walk tall" 8 times in a row. worse even than watching the home shopping network. eww. EWW
The "fake-news" TV movie had already be done, and done better, ten years ealier as "Special Bulletin".  Where the first movie took its subject, nuclear disarmament and terrorism, seriously, this cheese-fest doesn't respect the viewers' intelligence at all.  They pull every heartstring and throw every cheap trick they can think of at the camera.  Not of it ties together in any coherent way and the "make love not war" ending reeks of junior-high-school sophistry
I really enjoyed Goodbye Lenin, and it was mostly on the basis of seeing thatm film that I decided to watch this one. The film follows three idealistic, politically right-on young people rebelling against what they see as unthinking, selfish and uncaring Bourgeois consumer society. This rebellion takes the form of breaking into rich peoples houses, moving their furniture around, and leaving notes like 'You are too wealthy' - very situationist (never mind the fact that this point is probably largely lost on the rich people they break into).All this is fine and well, but the problem with the film is that on the one hand it glamourises these young people, and on the other paints every single other person in the film as some rich, ignorant Bourgeois pig. In the first ten minutes or so, I thought this might be a clever bit of directing, in which we view society as seen through their eyes, rather than society in its reality. However, this wasn't to be the case. The world remained Bourgeois, the kids are alright. The older generation Bourgeoise are bare cyphers, and none (with the exception of the man they kidnap) is given anything like a personality. When a break-in goes wrong and they have to kidnap the rich man who lives there, and take him away to a shack in the hills. During this time, they decide to 'educate' him about the wrongs of the world and the rich man's part in them. The rich man barely challenges the young people at all, and accepts much of what he has done is probably wrong. The anti-capitalist argument running through the entire film is very one-sided. I could appreciate the film a little bit more if it was balanced, but this wasn't. Furthermore, there are all the usual cliches associated with this type of work - the Edukators are young, good-looking and artistic - the subtext being that because they are arty, they can see things that others can't. At one point, one of the characters is on a bus when three men (presumably police, though its not made clear) hassle a drunk for not having a ticket. The character angrily bursts in and tells them to leave the drunk alone, gives the drunk his ticket, and gets off the bus. Do drunks even get hassled on buses by gangs of police? Can't say that's my experience - amybe they do in Germany. This is a recurring problem with the film - situations designed to show the main characters in a good light are contrived and unrealstic.The anarchist/marxist/anti-capitalist dialouge the characters preach is so generic that it actually ends up being meaningless - by the end of the film you don't actually know what exactly they stand for, or what their solutions are to the problems of society. Basically, the one-sided political argument hamstrings the characters development. Their views are never challenged, so they don't change. It is left to the kidnapping and love triangle to create the conflict in the film. The ending is also unbeleivably cynical, and completely undoes any idealism that had been generated in the course of the film.Generally, it feels like a script written by a 1st year politics student, being so utterly simplistic in it's 'the Rich are all bad' message. I would recommend this to anyone who is 17 years old and angry at society, but at the same time I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wanted some insight into how we should solve the world's problems. There has been a rash of good political films lately - Good Night and Good Luck, Syriana, The Constant Gardener. Unfortunately, and given so much potential, this film is not one of them. Shame
They spend the first half of this movie saying how great the Ultimate Warrior was.  The journey is awesome!  Then all of the sudden, the paid WWE guys just began to bad-mouth the Warrior. Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved?  They take some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young, and I really can't distinguish one's ability from the other. They just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this, they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug use? Which drugs? Presumably they're talking about steroids. But what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug use. Let's not talk about that - let's just keep ganging up on the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don't! He excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don't even let the Warrior defend himself.  Why did I have to find out from IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don't they address this?  This "docu" is more slanted than "Fahrenheitt 911" Every wrestling and Ultimate Warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it. It just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth, tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking.
This DVD was a total disappointment.  First of all, this video was a rip off of Baby Genius series, but without the production value.  Second, this video promises to introduce your child to fruits and vegetables and healthy eating habits.  To be fair, there are fruits and vegetables, but not so cleverly disguised in this video you will find dead and burned animals (grilled turkeys etc.) and rotten milk (in other term cheese), chicken period (eggs), ice cream ( I think it's a child abuse to feed your 6 month old ice cream!) and other non-fruit and non-vegetable foods.  This video shows a toddler chewing on a hunk of parmasan cheese that's bigger than baby's head!  I believe it is morally right to properly advertise your product and not misrepresent what your product has to offer, especially when it comes to offering children first look at health and nutrition.  I would NOT recommend this video for vegetarians, vegans, or other parents looking to teach their children proper health and eating habits.
I was very disappointed with this show. Having read the reviews I decided to buy the dvd, now I feel cheated. The jokes are weak, his inaccurate depiction of Africa and his off-the-mark African accent were more annoying than amusing. Jamie was crude, disgusting and even more disappointingly, not funny at all. He will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it wasn't his best performance. He had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly. I do not recommend this dvd at all
These plays were okay, I'm glad I rented them before buying them.  The props and things were very nice, the actors didn't gel well with each other or connect with their characters and the singing was mediocre ( definitely no Tyler Perry quality on that note) but the messages were good just seemed a little unrealistic and too drawn out.  I thought Alexander O'Neal sang in one of them but he didn't
This movie is a rehash of the first, but it is a crappy, unconvincing, emotionally uninspiring movie. Let me guess what part 3 will be about: A guy who looks at video or pictures goes back in time, does not alter that timeline the way he wants (i.e. always worst case scenario) and ends up killing himself in the end for the sake of everyone else
this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television.NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD  SOME GREAT TALENTA song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.    
Maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the Russian President and Jack Ryan are talking to each other through the computer, repeat is spelled "reapeat".  On top of that, the acting was horrible...this movie didn't take itself seriously enough.  Ben Affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in Pearl Harbor
I could not force myself to watch this film in its entirety. I think I made it about 45 minutes in. Despite many fine actors, esp. the always interesting Jeff Bridges, who brings a layered sadness to many of his roles, I simply could not connect and did not care about these people.It was this huge budget American movie shorthand: we're supposed to care because we've been given a snippit of a scene that reminds us of something else, but it just doesn't work for me. If I don't care this far into the movie, it just won't happen.Visually beautiful, and sky high production values on costumes and sets, it is wasted in these disjointed storytelling. Whoever cast the extras has wonderful faces, which the cinematographer and editor took full advantage of, but why don't we get faces like that in the major characters. Of course Chris Cooper has that kind of face, but many others (esp. all the "size 2 women" in the supporting roles)seem to have stepped out of a commercial.The Chicago tribune called this film "sleek and beautiful." I will completely agree with that, but so are music videos. I kept asking myself, what is wrong, what is misfiring? I really wanted to like it. Some of it is the short-hand story telling, but the look was almost too pretty. When the cinematography is this gorgeous, you want and need to linger on something smaller and deeper, or really take all the time you need to connect with something bigger -a mini-series. Ultimately, I began wondering if the original length was much longer, and it was cut down so much that it became fractured, and if that is the case, my apologies to the director. This is the kind of film that makes me ponder, what is it that European film-makers "get" that we lose in our big budget studio films? Is the system itself hurting some films, by sanitizing and conforming them, when they need to stick out like an unruly horse's nose at the starting gate?Very beautiful, but no connection, and not satisfying... well, that's a lot of things in Hollywood in a nutshell, isn't it? There are lots of special features on this DVD, but if I can't sit through the film, I don't care about the extras.  So glad I borrowed this instead of buying it!  I hear the book is something wonderful...
I got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development. My baby watched about two mintues and was gone. I think this is pitched as a baby video but it's really more geared toward older children. None of the elements have anything to do with the music, making is virtually useless as a learning development product. I give it a big "thumbs down". Try any one of the baby faith products like God Made Me, God Made Music and God Made Animals. They're awesome!
I had higher expectations when I purchased this DVD.I was not disappointed technically but I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the acting as a whole and with the uneven singing of Rachel York.  She couldn't seem to decide whether she wanted a pop, jazz, or traditional musical theatre sound.  Her voice was all over the place.  Furthermore, I found her character very annoying...she was screechy and not at all vunerable.  I preferred Kathryn Grayson's performance in the movie as she managed to be vunerable, witty, and charming, as well as screechy, demanding, and somewhat tyrannical.  Truly, I could barely watch this entire video and at the end I could have cared less if Fred and Lilli got together.  I think that was the most powerful statement for me.The production was acted (or directed) with a lot of mugging and so much of it was over the top.  Can today's directors PLEASE leave something for the audience to think about and figure out themselves?  Everything need not be a commentary!I wish I had seen Marin Mazzie because I heard she was incredible. Rent this before buying it or better yet do what I did and buy it used.  It hardly cost anything and that is what is it worth
Unable to see the movie. Received the original shipment, and later a replacement, and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie
I'm not a mainstream Beavis & Butthead fan...the fans that jumped on the bandwagon when they became popular.  I was there from the beginning.  Where the hell is FROG BASEBALL and BURGER WORLD.  I want to see BURGER WARS!!!!  There was a time when Beavis didn't even talk he just laughed (heh, heh, heh).  Fire....Fire!!!  I want Season 1,2,3.  Just release them as Seasons....let us be the judge of what is good and what sucks.  I want full episodes with videos included.  EVERY TV SHOW IS LIKE THIS ON DVD.  Why is this one different?!  DEMAND FULL EPISODES AND FULL SEASONS!!! 
This movie was the most disappointing piece of garbage I have ever seen.  Aniston's character goes through hell to see this guy wake up and when he finally does and shows her that he is ready to give her what she has been wanting she up and rejects him.  That is total nonsense.  I expected them to get back together in the end.  Real people do not behave like this.  Or maybe they do... it would go a long way in explaining the suicide rate in this country
Sit down under a tree, give it a big hug, fire up you bong and go to sleep. That's what I was waiting for Freeman to do all movie. It's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this Sci-fi Hippie flick. I'm surprised that Freeman's suit wasn't tie-dyed. Keep your money say no to drugs!
The Long Long Trailer is a good movie but Too Many Girls is when Lucy and Desi were very young and thin but the movie Too Many Girls is awful and Forever Darling is awful
I was all geeked to watch this but was disapponted...I don't feel lke they picked the right person to direct this movie.  It seemed very empty to me! The fighting scenes were blah and that was what really blew it for me...maybe if it was longer it would have been better?  I don't know...and then there was a mini plot with a brother and sister that SEEMED OUT OF PLACE!!  sigh...Azumi was a much better martial arts sword movie
This movie made no sense to me whatsoever. it wasn't really funny and it wasn't scary. the only thing that i got was that he killed Zombies or "Returners" as he called theme. and was upssed with one. i have to admit the female lead in the film was hot. but that was the only good thing in the film. it was also boring. but if you are into forgin fright films this is the movie for you
This movie was just plain bad. It doesn't just stink, it reeks. If I was to say this movie was horrible that would be a compliment. I can't believe that the other reviews were so complimentary. It's the reason why I purchased the movie and I regret my decision. I should have read the reviews more closely. Some of the reviewers hadn't acutally seen the film while I am convinced that a few of the other reviews were written by people associated with the film. Everything about this movie is sup-par. The script was horrible. The sets amateurish. The dialogue stilted. (And not in the funny style reminiscent of the TV series - which I loved). There are a number of things about the movie that were warning signs that this movie was going to stink.First the only footage they used was from the Batman movie. Not the TV series. I have a feeling that the people who have the rights to the TV series realized that this movie was so bad they didn't want to associate themselves with it. They didn't use the original Batmobile but a cheap rip off. I could continue by why make you suffer.The chemistry between Adam West and Burt Ward is non-existent. And the chemistry between the `actors' playing Adam West and Burt Ward in the `flashback' scenes is substandard at best. This movie is beyond dreadful. There are cameos from a few villains from the original TV show but they're dreadful too. Not because they are bad actors but because the script and plot are that bad. I wish I could say I laughed. I wish I could say that I at least cracked a smiled but unfortunately all I can say is that I watched this movie in dead silence. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVI
So I decided maybe I'll give this exploitation thing a try considering I love gore,violence, and horror movies. The reason I give it a 1 star is because it just isn't that good of a movie. It's VERY boring for most of the movie. About the first 20 or so minutes few words are even said. Then the guys just rape this woman several times, then she comes back for a very unsatisfying revenge. It's very slow paced and doesn't live up to the hype. It isn't all that gory, and it isn't scary either. Also, the rape isn't that convincing. I'm not saying I need everything shown in detail, but the acting is so bad it makes it seem as if its not even a big deal. Oh, and the woman gets revenge on one of the men who raped her...and he was practically mentally retarded. The guy really just fell in with the wrong crowd and they convinced him to do something bad. That is not grounds for what she did to him, which in my opinion was the worst of the killings. Anyways. not that good of a movie, don't let the lure of sleaze and violence make you think it will be worth your time because its not
I hated, hated, hated, hated this movie. It didn't make sense to me. To depresssing
Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look act so dumb by English Dubb. ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots, and bulls though
I am big horror movie fan so this flick sat with me fairly well.It was kind of cornie but with Yvonne(lily munster)DeCarlo and a great actor in Rod Steiger it held my interest,also throw in Michael J Pollard who always plays an off the wall character and I guess that is what keeps this movie afloat
Don't buy this. "From the Grave" is overdubbed b/w film without Bruce Lee in it. The other two aren't great either
Belushi's crowning jewel perfomance in my opinion is when he played opposite Monty Python's Michael Palin as the MANLY  Captain Ned in the Miles Cowperthwaite skits. They are both absent from this DVD nor on any SNL video I can find.
most boring of the barbie movies, i am sure glad my daughter has stopped asking to watch it over and over. and when it is so boring it seems to drag on forever. and i agree with another reviewer, princess and the pauper and rapunzel, much better!!!
I watched parts of all the "Let's Dance Salsa" DVDs and what a joke.  Is this guy serious?  He needs to get a few DVDs himself to find out about Salsa, rhythm, lead and following, and just general concepts of dancing.  I agree with a few other folks who wrote reviews...what qualifies him as an instructor?  I think he's doing an injustice to Salsa.  If anyone is considering learning from these DVDs...don't.  You'll not only learn some bad habits in dancing, but you'll be a joke on the dance floor.The only worth these DVDs have to anyone interested in Salsa is for a good laugh.  Seriously...Amazon should consider removing this product
    While the story may be entertaining in its own right, and ANY chance to see Donald O'Conner dance is worth it, this can be a very disappointing film to Porter buffs.  The plot has nothing to do with the stage play except that some of it does take place on a ship. The story line is totally different and therefore some of Porter's original songs have been taken out and replaced by songs of Sammy Cahn and James Van Huesen which do not live up to Porter's quality.     The best examples I can give is the fact that there is no Evangelist so the title song "Anything Goes" turns into a second act number, sung by Mitzi and chorus (with horrific word changes) and "Blow Gabriel Blow" becomes a finale in the broadway show (sung by the four main characters) that comes at the end of the picture and has nothing to do with any character or plot line.    If you haven't seen it on stage it's pleasant enough, but if you're expecting the broadway show it's a major disappointment
This particular DVD edition of Nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film's mood.  I'm not sure when this "score" was "written", although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film.  Nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film.  With this edition's music, I got confused at times between what I saw and what I heard, and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while.  If you want an affective, edge-of-the-seat experience out of Nosferatu, I reccomend another edition. 
Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre. Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, "The Descent" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made.  In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, "The Descent""The Descent" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.At the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.Even though "The Descent" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity."The Descent" is unrated and contains violence and language
This is one of the worst edited documentary I have ever seen.You can not have a single shot spoiled with flashes, slow motion, and unnecessary digital FX. I have nothing against crazy editing when it is for a 3 min MTV music clip or a TV add. But on a 7 hours documentary you get airsick.If fine edited, all this interresting story could have been told in less than two hours.Each episode has a more than 2 min introduction... During the episodes you see some shots more than ten times.By the way, I am a very long time aviation enthousiast
Just look how many are for sale, thats got to be a clue on how horrible this film is. It has so much nudity and bad language it was disgusting. I fastforwarded about 70% of the movie! and what got me was on the back it says "Family-Friendly" im still laughing about that! What has this world come to? I would never let my kids watch it let alone anyone! Even my husband was disgusted and wanted me to write this review so some poor person doesn't buy or rent this movie. Im embarassed that I rented it! Please turn away now
I bought the DVD for my collection after watching the film on TCM.  The musical perfomances are terrific.  Upon receiving the DVD, I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD production.  The DVD states Digital sound, but the sound quality is very poor and not at all as enjoyable as the broadcast on TCM. 
 If you believe in the Devil, and I mean *really* believe in the devil, I can't think of one good reason why you'd want to summon the Devil into this world. At worst, he's purported to be the father of lies, and one of the fallen angels. This means that anything he tells you is suspect, anything he gives you is suspect, and he probably has the power to make you believe in him. Yikes. Not a safe trip. Not a terribly sane trip, for that matter.Yet that is precisely what Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) desired. He had one copy of "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadow", and there were three extant. One or all of these books is a forgery, and one or all holds the secret to summoning Satan. He hires Corso (played a bit too understated by Johnny Depp) to research the other texts.The movie is based on the novel "The Club Dumas" by Arturo Perez Reverte, which I favorably reviewed.I can't give a similar review to The Ninth Gate for a number of reasons. First, Depp's portrayal of Corso was one dimensional, and Corso was a multi-dimensional character. Whether that's the filmmaker's fault or Depp's I don't know, but Depp's Corso was a dreadful bore.A mysterious girl appeared and became an ally of his, demonstrating supernatural abilities. We are never given ample evidence as to why she might have had an interest in helping Corso, or in what her abilities might have been (never mind her identity). Yet since this is a character from the book, I know why she was there, I have a pretty good idea who she was (and good job to the author on how he handled that!) and her character's interests and abilities could have been better communicated, with very little difficulty.Also, in a rather silly departure from the book (departures are fine...I'm not being a book snob), they substitute an average sized platinum-blonde haired black male for a character in the book who was tall, white, and physically imposing. There's nothing that irritates me more than a "quota substitute". I don't think this particular sub had any speaking lines, which makes it that much more of an insult.I love intelligent thrillers. (I didn't care for The Da Vinci Code.) This was a thriller that spent time in libraries, that examined woodcuttings drawn, perhaps, by Lucifer himself - yet I wasn't engaged.In 1999, when the film was released, I couldn't sit through it. After reading The Club Dumas and then discovering that there was a connection between the two, I approached the film again, hoping that understanding where the book was coming from would help. It did not. In fact, it raised more questions.I would give this movie 2.5 stars and round it up to 3; however, I'm reviewing the DVD and the DVD gets a big spanking for not having subtitles. There's no excuse, in this day and age, for a mainstream DVD not to offer subtitles.
I did not like this DVD at all.  It requires too many props such as bricks, belts, towels, blankets, chairs, etc... Each pose takes too long due to lengthy explanations.  As a beginner I find this too boring and studio based and unable keep my attention.  I feel it was a waste of money and don't recommend it
2 1/2 stars.This is a very good concert teaming up a pre-"grammy" Santana with Wayne Shorter of Weather Report fame. great rhythm section, drums, conga, timbale. top notch musicians, first rate performance, very entertaining. my big problem comes with the quality of the DVD. I don't see the excellent picture others are raving about and when it comes to the audio options even if the back cover states DD 2.0, DD 5.1 and DTS, the menus are showing something else (DD2.0, DTS 2.0 and DTS 5.1) but neither DTS stream seem to be working. only DD stereo works. I own close to 200 DVD's and all work fine, DTS and all. Bought it directly from amazon, I had it replaced and the new one is the same. This is not part of the great Live at Montreux series productions which are all great, no matter how old the concert is.So the 2 1/2 stars overall rating comes from 4 star performance combined with a 1 star DVD quality.
Over half of this movie consists of scenes taken  from the original 1939 classic film directed by Zoltan Korda. Even those scenes can't disguise the remake's network TV-movie quality. Beau Bridges is generally a good actor,  but he is terribly miscast on this film. Go rent both versions of The Four  Feathers and see it for yourself
I'm watching the film right now, and it is perhaps the most moronic and stupidly annoying film I've ever seen.  There's nothing amusing going on.  It's all fluff and show.  It is such garbage.  I find it offensively stupid
Dirty Deeds is one of those movies that you sit through saying to yourself, "this is idiotic", but instead of abandoning it midway through you find yourself still sitting through it until the credits begin to roll.It's silly. It's a teenager movie. It's been done a million times before in Hollywood (most of the time poorly). Dirty Deeds is one of the sub-par high-schoolers-making-mischief-attempts where if you're perusing cable late one night--and can't find anything else on your 500 channels--is maybe worth a stop if you're determined to watch TV instead of just going to bed.But who knows...you might be seeing the beginning of some great careers! Just look what 1980's teeneager movie Hollywood Knights launched for the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer, Tony Danza, Robert Wuhl and Fran Drescher. Everybody's got to start somewhere, right?
So I finally rented this tripe as I was curious.Gee, making fun of former Soviet block nations/people and rednecks.. now there's some seriously funny stuff..NOT! What's next? A cutting edge comedy on the rap culture?..oops, he already did this with the Ali G show. Gross out potty humour, now that's inventive and we've never seen that before! I also like the lame-o attempt to show how Americans are all anti semitic by putting words into the mouths of those trying to sell him something. These are your imagined demons/foes Sacha and overall your film is pretty boring and about as fresh as a Yakov Smirnoff comedy bit
This is Arnolds fakiest film.  I mean, a demigod?  I can't believe this at all...fakiest film.  Yes Arnold is in peak condition in this film, but his other films are simply a little easier to swallow...come on Arnold, no one talks back to Zeus
This was the word used by one reviewer, and it just about sums up the film. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head by saying that many young wannabe creative persons start off with highly auto-biographical and introspective pieces of work. Usually these are binned, as the person matures. Asia seems to have the advantage of a parental environment sufficiently indulgent and well-heeled to let her have her way on film, instead of on scraps of paper like the great majority. But good art is more than self-expression, self-promotion, self-pity and self-indulgence. It should have a satisfying underlying form, say something new to its audience, expose some as yet unperceived truth about life and humanity. Art is boring if it merely tells us something we already know, especially if it's told in a semi-familiar way. Most of what Asia says in this film we do already know, if we are half-aware of what goes on around us. Still, the girl has a cute face, and she's put a lot of effort into this performance. Something more may come with time.  
The film seems to focus on 70's punk exclusively.  Anything post-1980 is glossed over, clumped together and generally viewed with dissapointment by this "documentary".  I think the film does well documenting the roots of punk, seeing as how Letts was steeped in the scene at that time (although The Misfits weren't mentioned, which I found odd).  The interviews with Henry Rollins and Jello Biafra were great as well.  However, in order to claim to be a documentary, the evolution of punk rock is just as integral (perhaps more so) as its origins.  I think, basically, Letts based the film on his own opinions, likes and dislikes instead of actually documenting punk.  I was disapointed.       
This smarmy Kevin Costner vehicle is a trite half-baked movie.  I found this movie nearly unwatchable.  If you're looking for outstanding movies with a baseball theme try Bull Durham and Eight Men Out
this movie is the worst movie I have ever seen!  Complete waste of my time
This production is misleadingly named.  Far from being a biography of Grand Duchess Anastasia, it is really the story of how the deaths of her family at the hands of Russian revolutionaries in 1918 spawned one of the 20th century's enduring mysteries -- a mystery which was given a unique lease on life when, among the myriad male and female claimants to be survivors of the imperial family, one woman began to pick up supporters in the 1920's among at least some people who had had contact with the original family.I do not fault this production for failing to be a real biography.  After all, how much of a biography can one write on a 17-year-old girl whose life was largely one of sheltered privilege?  However, I do fault this production for being a badly-flawed recounting of history.  And I am not talking about the interminable debate that still rages in the arcane world of Romanov history buffs about whether Anna Anderson was really Anastasia.This work's take on the life of Anastasia paints a very tilted picture both of the world of the Romanovs, their support among their subjects, and their reputation among today's Russians.First, life in the inner sanctum of Nicholas's family was not the halcyon existence this production claims.  Certainly the family had great wealth and huge staff at its disposal.  But neither Nicholas nor Alexandra were well-suited to their roles, and they lived under the strain of it.  They were increasingly isolated from the extended Romanov clan, who shared the dawning awareness of the Russian people that the monarchy was in serious trouble.  While these forces might not have touched Anastasia directly, she was certainly touched by her brother's hemophilia and her mother's response of sinking into frail health, chronic emotional distress, and a religious mysticism that almost bordered on hysteria at times.Secondly, this film's portrayal of the counter-revolutionary White Army as determined to save their beloved tsar from captivity is just plain wrong.  While the Whites wanted to unseat the Bolshevik revolution, there was virtually no support for a Romanov restoration among the leadership of the White Army.  Nor are there any known attempts by the counter-revolutionary forces to rescue their former imperial family.  In fact, one senior White military leader once remarked, "having seen the monarchy at close quarters, I have no desire to see its return."And thirdly, while there is a gradual rehabilitation of the last Romanov's reputation underway in Russia today, the notion that the murdered Romanovs are saints is not nearly the widespread sentiment that this production claims.  In fact, the great masses of modern Russians are far more interested in making their new democracy work than in figuring out how to get the sainted Romanovs back on a throne.I do not know whether these flaws arise from some agenda to rehabilitate the Romanovs, whether they arise from sloppy research that relied too much on the fawning pseudo-history that plagues serious study of the Russian monarchy's fading years, or whether this production did not have access to newly-opened archives.  But -- whatever the reason(s) -- it does a disservice to the study of history by claiming to be history when it is, in fact, closer to a grocery-store romance novel
With a very good scenario and a fantastic Kris Kristofferson the film is slow, over male attitude, and finally  poorly made and boring
The movie has a great story. Unlike Streetfighter Alpha the Movie, Alpha Generations actually follows the correct storyline. It had the potential to be a great movie, but there is to much wrong with it that cannot be overlooked that will irritate you immediately. The character design sucks(Why dosen't Ryu look like Ryu?), the English voice acting sucks(I recommend watching it in japanese with subtitles) and the fights suck. The only fight worth watching during the whole movie is Ryu vs. Sakura. This film dosen't even deserve a 1 star rating. I just gave it that because there's no way to go lower
In this sixth (but not final) installment of the movie series, what we get is little story and too much senseless action (with a sprinkling of hot tub sex).  This is a very disappointing film.  Although it is the last such LWnC movie from this creative team, it does not end the storyline (with 28 volumes in the manga series, we probably would have needed another 3-7 films).  So the patient, constant viewer gets instead a hack-and-slash film of mid-caliber.The ending -- an over-extending action sequence set on a snowy slope -- is very unsatisfying; so are the characters:  unlike other LWnC films, we do not get to meet any new incidental characters.  As a result, the film is less about "Edo" soceity (which one cannot argue is the secondary if not primary goal of the manga team) and instead just a big showdown waiting to happen...waiting, waiting to happen.  The film is way too long and its pacing is horrible.I think the fault with the film lies in these two things:1) the writers/filmmakers chose poor source material.  The "five wheel" assassin team denies Itto and son the chance to mingle with regular Edo joes.  As a result, you do not get as I argued the best part of the series:  the rich detail of Edo life.2) the filmmakers must have been overwhelmed with James Bond films like "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" and whatnot with their decision to make this movie "samurai on skis".  After the first few minutes of fighting on the snow, I was thinking "Enough already, I get it:  samurai can be badass even on slippery surfaces!"Watch the first five and forever skip this sixth installment
This is nothing but a huge dissapointment. There's almost nothing on this video about baseball. If there was a rating lower than zero stars, I would give it that rating.
Just a warning to everyone that buys this version of the DVD, it's fullscreen and doesn't have any special features.  Now if you've seen the scenes that weren't included in the extended VHS, but were for some reason on the cable version, you'd see that they were among some of the funniest in the movie.  I'd really like to see this one get maybe a double DVD release with When Nature Calls, souped up and some of those great missing scenes including Ace singing onstage with Cannibal Corpse (funniest scene in the whole movie I thought), Ace conversing with a few drunks in Ray Finkle's hometown and some others.  
I was so excited when I read the reviews for this intermediate level Pilates tape. Thought I would purchase it for variety from my 'The Method' Pilates tape. I was very disappointed. The tape does not even allow you to get your heart racing much less to break a sweat. I didn't feel like I got a good tone workout. I actually wanted to fall asleep. I felt it was 40 minutes of stretch for an intermediate level student. I give two stars because I do believe he knows what is talking about in terms of form but I shall be passing this on to an elderly relative
As a character movie this is largely a failure, unless you find poignancy in "average-ness." The characters are all one-note half-stereotypes who seem to be sleeping their way through the non-existent plot. "Oh, look how average they are! Isn't it charming how they sit around and talk about nothing? It's so lifelike!" And the main character's seeming inability to be anything other than perfectly angelic at all times makes it awfully hard to sympathize with her.If this is intended to be an issue movie with the message Robert Ebert has suggested (that anti-abortion laws are really just a form of discrimination against poor women), it's taking a rather belabored approach just to tell us what anyone with a head on their shoulders already knows. Munich and Syriana also "bring to light" ideas that are not new or novel or shocking to anyone who cares to be informed and think about the world. Perhaps the only thing truly shocking is that movies like this would need to be made to say such obvious things. Perhaps next they'll make a movie to make the point that, shockingly enough, the sky is blue, or that paint dries when applied to walls, or that grass grows. I imagine they'd be somewhat more interesting than this effort
Why?Why waste your time and money on producing crap?Sony execs must be out of their minds. The Ghostbuster fans have been waiting years, and writing countless petitions to get the episodes on DVD, and this is what they come up with?No. Give us season DVDs. Give us a 140 episode box set. Give us something. Not 4 non-sequential episodes on a disc that can hold MANY times that.What a waste. This product gets 1 star because, apparently, you can't give it zero
Abraham Lincoln's law partner once wanted to read some maudlin poetry to Abe.  Once he was done, Lincoln said "The people who like this sort of thing will find it the sort of thing they like."Beaches is fine.  It is obviously a chick flick.  Bette Midler has some real opportunities to sing.  The acting is good.  The problem is that the plot is so predictable
Warning: Spoilers Abound.Okay folks, I was flipping channels and came across a movie called The Hole, starring Thora Birch, Keira Knightley and Desmond Harrington. Now, aside from this terrible blunder I'm going to tell you about in just a few more sentences, the film was fairly entertaining. I dig Thora Birch, and her character was really well-played. What really shocked me though, was my quick research after the film was over. I mean, I checked IMdB, Rotten Tomatoes and Wikipedia. Although all reputable sources, none mentioned this ridiculous mistake.Have you ever been so utterly sure of something so blantantly, painstakingly obvious that it would literally take an entirely different, alien planet to be able to even minutely comprehend the vast insipidness of its vacuous residents? That's how I felt after watching this movie and realizing that apparently I'm the only goddamn human being on this prosaic, infantile planet who immediately saw the dimwitted aberration for what it was!And what exactly was this stupendous error, you ask? Well... It's very simple. I mean, it couldn't get more common sensically moronic than this. The basic plot of the film is four teenagers trapped in an old war bunker. The movie begins with Thora Birch's rendition of what happened: that her friend set this whole thing up, locked them in the 'hole' and didn't come back when he was supposed to. She escapes and the three others die. The story changes from what she originally told her psychiatrist to what actually happened. Turns out the only way out was actually locked from the inside and Thora had the key the whole time. The other teenagers die for various reasons, irrelevant to the blunder at hand, and she ends up telling the tale to her psychiatrist from inside the bunker. In the end, she kills the guy who set it up and plants the key on him. The police come and find Thora and her psychiatrist in the 'hole' and after rebuking the psychiatrist, mention that the case is now closed. At that moment, a flashback shows Thora murdering her friend that set everything up and planting the key on him. Right after that moment, I said to myself: "What the heck? The door locks from the inside?! It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that either a) the door was never locked, or b) someone had to unlock it from the inside!" Alright, those weren't my exact words, but good god, it's so obvious!And that, my friends, has got to be possibly the worst film blunder ever
This film is visually stunning and impressive, and has talented and credible actors.  Unfortunately, there is barely a story with a lot of poorly-developed characters who are "trained"/brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity.  The settings and group "sermons" from Nazi officials are striking and convincing, but there is nothing that ties it all together.  Our hero fails to strike the "killer blow" and is stripped, literally and figuratively, of all status and walks away.  The end.I'm forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film, and I was surprised by how un-gay it was.  In fact, the two boy "friends" work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress.  It's more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else. I have issues with some of the pacing as well.  I found myself pressing the fast forward button several times, and didn't really seem to miss much.  Not a good sign.So, for what it is, it's okay.  Certainly not a masterpiece, and certainly not something to run out and buy. 
This mediocre effort is disappointingly unfunny. Considering the comedic caliber of its two stars, Billy Crystal and Robin Williams, I was expecting a laugh riot, but that's not what this is. It's not their fault, it's the scriptwriter's. I guess maybe it was just one of those scripts that read funny on paper, but that humor just didn't translate to the screen, despite the best efforts of Mssrs. Crystal and Williams. They deserve better, and so do we
 This is bring to your notice that the product that i have orderd has not reached me yet. I request you to do the needful.Thanking youPrince Georg
This is the WORST transfer to DVD I've ever seen!!! I think the VHS copy looks and sounds better, do NOT waste your money!!
I used to have respect for Bill Maher. He used to actually inspire me when it came to being brave enough to argue my own opinions without making apologies; but not anymore. My respect dissipated as his fairness was replaced by blinding hatred for GWB and religion. I watched "I'm Swiss" once and almost couldn't refrain from vomiting. He talks about the usual suspects: the president, religion, obesity, same-sex marriage, Rap, and few other things that "comedians" are good at joking about and liberals are good at preaching about. I know, I know, he's not a liberal, he's a libertarian. Well, I have watched and listened to Bill Maher and I know which side he's on most of the time, and it sure isn't on the right. He hates organized religion and traditional morality too much to be on the right much of the time. I don't know why his panties are in such a bunch. Being organized is better than being disorganized (I can tell jokes too). I'm not religious; and I can't help but see much of it as hard to swallow, but I'm not arrogant enough to call all of it just a bunch of fairytales created and believed by people with neurological disorders. I wasn't there when the Bible was written or when the events took place. I can't say it's all fairtyales. I can only say some of it isn't logical. But, I respect religion and its purposes; which is what separates me from him. He has no qualms about crushing the hope of people who believe in an afterlife or religion, which are both things that make life more bearable for them. The purpose of religion is to provide hope and solace and relief to people who are living in desperation. The same purpose of drugs I might add: something Maher not only defends but abuses. Why the double standard?  This is no longer the eleventh century where Protestants are killing Catholics. The only people k/illing in the name of religion are fanatical Muslims, but most religious people are good, decent, nonviolent individuals. Maher's not an atheist, but he has recently expressed a "could be, could be not" attitude toward the existence of a G/od, which would make him agnostic. But one thing is for sure, atheism has more blood on its hands than religion does. Two of our biggest mass murderers--Hitler and Stalin--were atheist. It's a shame when non comedians are actually funnier than Maher, who wears the comedian label but is too bitter to be a good one. Most of the time, he can barely get the joke out without laughing at himself. I laughed twice during the entire show. No one has ever accused Maher of being modest. He's a smug, intellectual elitist. And those are his GOOD qualities. "I'm Swiss" displays this all too clearly. In case you didn't know, "I'm Swiss" is a running joke of Maher's embarrassment of being an American. He'd rather belong to a country where ethics are a substitution for, not an extension of, morality; where any depraved activity that has no victim is not immoral at all; where adultery is seen as cute, not sinful; where there are no fat people; where the only women who exist are the pretty ones he can sleep with or the ugly ones who agree with his opinions.Thank God I live in America and not Switzerland.
No No No!!! DVD technology is for quality image and  movie  collectors. This time Artisan did not pay respect. I think it's the worst DVD in my collection. Bad transfer, full frame and etc
I have always had a morbid fascination with that segment of the population that believes that the Bible is the only book one has to read, and that great literature consists entirely of the Left Behind series.  I bought this movie to get a sense of this group.Banal is the kindest word I can find for this tripe.  Third rate actors, low-rent science fiction backdrops, and completely out of touch with reality.  The movie opens with the Israeli agricultural "miracle."  What it does not tell the audience is that Israel would be a dead state if it were not for the 20% of the Israeli government's budget funded by US taxpayers through the US Government's very unwise investment in this apartheid regime (see Jimmy Carter's new book) and if it were not for the blatant Israeli underground pipes that are literally looting the Arab aquifers at long range and from way beneath the earth.  Israeli agriculture is not a miracle, it is a travesty--it consumes 50% of all the water used in Israel, and produces less than 5% of the Gross Domestic Product.The movie goes downhill from there.  Just to place it in a proper religous movie context, if the "Ten Commandments" was a perfect 10, this movie is no more than a 1 and certainly not even close to a 2
sorry, can't finish this garbage movie. is this girl retarded  or what? watching her father been killed in cold blood and got no feeling or emotion at all. how and why the garbage collecting, turned cow feeder young guy, would then have turned into a cold blood stone cold killer? there's no enough logic and explanation why he would have turned into a psychopath. the girl didn't look a bit retarded but acted and behaved like one is also a not quite well developed character. the whole movie just looked too deadbeat and senseless. what? life was too boring then what? started becoming natural born killer? give me a break. bone chilling? you can always say that again, but won't make me care a bit more.
HYPOCRISY ALERT! HYPOCRISY ALERT! I just wanted to get that out of the way right at the start. Not more than twenty-four hours ago I wrote a review waxing philosophic on the state of the modern horror film. I argued that fans shouldn't viciously tear apart every movie they find objectionable because the current spate of horror films is better than no horror films at all. In other words, we should accept the bad with the good rather than stop renting and thus face a potential drought of horror movies. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, I shall proceed to trash "Adam & Evil." I didn't set out to heap scorn on this film when I popped it in the DVD player a few weeks ago, although a cursory glance at the cover art sent a chill of disappointment through my body and I felt my heart sinking. In fact, nothing screams "straight to video" more loudly than a film entitled "Adam & Evil." Well, perhaps something like "Adam & the Bollweevil," or even "Adam & Evil Knievel" might rank as likelier candidates, but you get the idea. "Adam & Evil" does not inspire confidence that I'm about to watch a slasher film on par with Carpenter's "Halloween."Right from the start of the film we learn the filmmakers have cast us into the ninth circle of clichd slasher film hell. The movie introduces us to the typical bunch of young airheads getting ready to embark on a camping trip out in the sticks. There is Seth (Kevin Robson), the goofy virgin who tries too hard with the ladies but hopes that the trip will finally cure him of his unwanted condition. Then there is the snotty and narcissistic brunette Yvonne (Erica Cerra). Next up is a staple of every poorly made horror film, the ever important "loud guy" Matt (Brody Harms). Along for the ride are Evelyn (Barbara Kottmeier), Adam himself (Sean Arnfinson), Adam's girlfriend Yvette (Lynsey Brothers), and a few other kids. I am willing to bet that as you look at this list you will notice the Eve connotation in the three girls' names, and that Seth is also a name pulled straight out of the Old Testament. Where Matt comes in is a mystery unless we look to the New Testament. Something tells me the Matthew responsible for the gospel didn't go around announcing to everyone who would listen that he wanted to be known as "Matt." Call it a gut feeling.Anyway, these dolts head out to the forest for a few fun filled days of gossip, drinking, and romping around in the water. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? See those bright objects moving in your peripheral vision? They're called red flags. Things get a little tense when they stop off at a local bar populated with the usual Hollywood redneck stereotypes in order to ask some questions only to discover that the locals, with the exception of the busty wife of the local sheriff, aren't interested in helping out. Too, a creepy park custodian stumbles into the campground and gives everyone a scare before scurrying back into the forest. If you think we'll see him again before the credits roll, that's one bet I won't take. I should also mention a couple of other potential stresses facing the group. Adam and his friend Matt did something quite idiotic a few years before--namely setting a house ablaze with fireworks that claimed the lives of the family living there--that continues to haunt them to this day. Too, one of the gals worries about a stalker boyfriend she recently broke up with. Both of these scenarios serve to provide us with potential red herrings in order to make the film more suspenseful. I laugh defiantly at such nonsense.I won't spoil the ending for you, but I will take a few seconds to describe the incredibly banal lead up to the "twist" ending. For a slasher film, "Adam & Evil" is downright puritanical with the red stuff. I felt like a bizarro Clara Peller hollering, "Where's the gore?" every time a killing went down. Seth, for example, perishes in his tent in a particularly bloodless, off camera fashion. A couple of the other kids meet their maker when they run into the killer while floating around on a raft in a pond, again a rather bloodless affair. The presence of a bow and arrows and a shed full of sharp instruments promised great things--a promise unfulfilled, unfortunately. "Adam & Evil" is one of the tamest slashers I have ever seen. What did they do, turn the script over to the Hayes Commission before shooting scenes? Note to aspiring filmmakers: if you're going to make a low budget slasher film that will never see a theatrical release, go over the top with the sauce. At least then you've got a shot at making a cult classic. And another thing: make sure you pick people with a modicum of acting skills instead of the mannequins posing as living beings in this film. Sure, you'll have to shell out a few more bucks, but it's worth it. Remember, unless I'm laughing so hard at the bad acting that the film achieves the coveted "so bad it's good" label, ham handed performances can only hurt you. Surprisingly, the DVD comes with a commentary track. Not that you'll want to listen to it, but there it is. We also get a few trailers for three other schlock films: "Contagion," "Hallow's End," and "Asylum Days." Forget about picking up a copy of "Adam & Evil." It's not the sort of film a hardcore horror fan wants friends to see prominently displayed on the movie shelf. There are plenty of other worthier slashers out there that demand your attention.
This is an excellent film, which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor.  I was very disapointed in the quality of the release- the picture quality is poor, inter-titles appear to be missing, and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that don't match the action on-screen.  It's a shame, because a film like this one deserves much better
When I first purchased the low-budget movie named "Pranks", I didn't really know what to expect.  After all, "Pranks" is a slasher/horror movie from the 80s, a very fertile period for such movies and time period which quite honestly produced some pretty good slasher and horror movies in general...unfortunately, after viewing "Pranks", I can honestly say that this is not one of them."Pranks" is about a group of college kids who are staying on campus over the holidays preparing a building which is going to be torn down I think (herein lies another problem in that it is very difficult to understand what is going on in this movie because the acting is so poor).  Obviously, most kids have gone home for Christmas and New Year's except for this group of kids and one "weird" kid who ostensibly becomes the lead suspect as gruesome murders begin to occur.  The murders remain largely unbeknownst to the characters in the movie, so the director and screenplay writer wanted to give the audience information to which the main characters are not privileged.  The plot is decent enough although the execution is formulaic/generic and lacks luster throughout the film.  One of the reasons for this is the pathetic acting we see in this movie, which really overshadows any kind of merit this movie is able to produce as a horror movie.  There is no question that "Pranks" is a low budget production to begin with and along with that, there is going to be some subpar acting, but the acting in "Pranks" is borderline-awful!!  It is this acting and poor direction that really makes it difficult for the tasteful horror movie viewer to stay interested.  In fact, the movie comes off very generic in style and substance, and rather predictable and boring.  The only thing that is even remotely interesting are the kills which aren't too bad considering the era in which this movie came out from.  The Director does use some weak misdirection to attempt to keep the audience guessing as to who the killer is, but the savy horror movie audience can clearly identify the "weird guy" as a "red herring" as another reviewer put it.  In summary, "Pranks" is a poorly executed attempt at a horror movie which suffers from terrible acting, extremely poor production values and flawed direction.  The result is a dull, boring and weak horror movie with a few decent kills...certainly nothing to write home about.  Also, as a final note, the actor who plays the killer does a terrible job and comes off, in the end at least, like a total wuss
Whether William Golding deserved Nobel Prize or not is still a debatable point, but it is true that he wrote one marvelous book, and its name is `Lord of the Flies.' But let's not talk about the differences between the book and the film for a while - because after all no one I am afraid can bring the multi-layered world of words onto the screen. Even those who loved the 1963 version would admit that. You can interpret the meaning of `Lord of the Flies' but who can really visualize it, or the imaginary conversations of Simon for that matter?The biggest problem of Harry Hook's new version is not the changes done to the film. The boys are American military school cadets, using dirty words frequently, but those parts didn't annoy me much. Real problem is something more essential to the film, which is storytelling. In short the 1990 film doesn't know what it wants to be. On the film's video cover you can read (and I quote) `this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the human soul." Well, not exactly.For as adventure story it lacks pace; the film always feels rushed and often needs better editing. As allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for each character. The conflict between Ralph and Jack should be clearer, and Piggy's role should be more than that of a whining fat boy. And don't forget Simon, who sees things, it is true, but definitely not those things that the film actually shows us.It is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful. It could have been a perfect backdrop against which dark allegorical survival story would develop, opposite of optimistic tales of Jules Verne's adventure stories. By watching this film you can follow the story of the book, but find no tension or thought-provoking words in it.Balthazar Getty's feature film debut. And Lewis M. Allen, one of the producers of the film, had also produced Peter Brook version in 1963
I bought this because Raquel Welch was in it. She did a good job but it's not worth it. I loss interest as sonn as I heard the guy talking about the people in the movie. This DVD was dated back to the 1920s and How a movie star struggles to get his life back
Really not worth the effort to find it, even if George MacDonald Fraser was involved with the screenplay. The producers chose the "least best" of the Flashman novels to adapt, they cast the wrong actor to play the role, and they reduced the whole story to a bawdy, not-very-funny, slapstick comedy. Don't bother searching for it. True Flashman fans will be disappointed
If the girls in this film were considered "hot" back in 1979 then I'm glad I was still in preschool.Some unattractive women, not college age girls, but actual 30-year-old women who cannot get into the popular Pi sorority start their own sorority called H.O.T.S. which stands for Help Out The Seals and sadly their pet seal was the best part of the movie.The goal of the H.O.T.S. girls is to steal all the guys away from Pi house, so they throw "wild" parties, jump topless out of a airplane (too bad the camera was on the ground), fly a hot air balloon over the Pi house to launch pies on the Pi girls as they sunbathe topless, etc.  The script seems to have been written by a 12-year-old, which isn't a bad thing.  I liked the fast-paced wackiness of it all and the frequent topless scenes were nice.  Unfortunately I didn't find any of the girls even remotely attractive.If this film was remade today with the same amount of nudity and with Nikki Ziering, Brittany Daniel, Shannon Elizabeth and Jenna Jameson as the four main H.O.T.S. girls and maybe Catherine Bell as the house mom it would gross over $800 million in DVD sales.I also agree with one of the previous reviewers who complained about the lack of rear shots.  How rude
im sure ill here alot from this review but everyone giving this movie 5 stars i dont see how or why.have you people just been introduced to the movie world?this movie is awful between the bad acting and the annoying music playing during talking scenes its flat out frustrating.rusty james brother in this movie acts like a mental case for you peole that havent seen this he dies in the end (i just saved you an hour and a half of your life cause now you wont have to waste it on this crappy movie).between the bad music the bad acting and the plot/storyline going all over the place in this movie its seriously like being on a bad acid trip.what a waste of money and time on this one.ill donate mine to goodwill or the garbage can..not worthy of my movie collection
I felt a little ripped off, when I got volume 1 and 2 together as an offer from Amazon.Com. Movie wise, volume 2 is actually exactly the same as volume 1, with volume 2 having the option for japanese dialog and Eng subtitle. Amazon could have at least indicated that in the &quot;description&quot;
I have now seen several Gerry Anderson projects, many hits and some misses, this one is close to dead last for me (wait, it is dead last). A priest driving a model T is the hero in this one. He also has a shrinking ray (shrinks to like 1/3 normal) that he uses on his assistant who is a groundskeeper/secret agent. Sound interesting? Well, I got the set cheap so why not buy it? If your an Anderson fan as I am, it was worth the price, just don't expect to show it to your friends as it's really tame and slow plodding with model T car chases and not a whole lot of action. Here is my ranking of the shows I like from Gerry Anderson so take that into account of your own tastes. #1 UFO (a live adult sci-fi show with some great character development), #2 Joe 90(the concept is great and the non continuous storylines work good here), #3 Captain Scarlet (I love the concept and a lot of the shows fit in with the current war on terror to me), #4 Thunderbirds (had a Corgi toy as a kid, it was the best show for kids on TV at the time), #5 Stingray (for the time, it was a great action kids show), #6 Fireball XL5 (like a Stingray except in space and black and white), #7 The Protectors (eh, it's OK), #8 Space 1999 (this is where my recommended shows stop, this show was so highly anticipated and quickly got really stupid even I couldn't stay with it in the 70's),#9 Terrahawks (just started watching it now it may move up above Space 1999 and the Protectors), #10 Secret Service. I haven't watched his other stuff and I know there is stuff out there like Supercar but that would probably rank above Secret Service for me.    
They say all the major characters come back in `Stitch the Movie,' quickly made direct-to-video sequel to the hugely popular `Lilo and Stitch.' For me, the original film's most appealing part is, and will be, Lilo and Stitch, one of the most delightful characters Disney created in the last decade. Do we still need Pleakley when we have Stitch? How about Cobra? Or some alien whose name you have forgotten? Do we need them? No, I don't think so.But `Stitch the Movie' crammed all these characters into this small film of which running time barely exceeds one hour, together with a weak story that repeats exactly what the original was doing. The original's idea of `Ohana' or `family' is changed to `cousin' this time, but for most of the viewers this is literally a twice-told story, no longer attractive enough.What makes us feel short-changed is, however, the lack of music and scenery, the impressive parts of `Lilo and Stitch.' Instead of Elvis songs, they have thrown in parodies or homage to other films and TVs like Monty Python and Ed Wood, completely missing the target audiences who would buy this DVD to experience the joyful sound and rhythm of this great singer. Moreover, the charming, water-color Hawaiian scenery is reduced to the generic, unimaginative backdrop which is barely OK even by the lower standard of the Disney's cheap sequels.The only saving grace is the presence of the actors who provided the voices to the characters. Except that, and the funny but brief scenes about the lovely pair Lilo and Stitch, `Stitch the Movie' looks like a pilot film for the original. Or perhaps it is.
The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality. The only problem is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one. I'm using the Plextor DVD burner (love it!!), but I'm going to try my luck with a different DVD brand. The failure rate for Memorex is unacceptable. It's less the cost that bothers me, but more the time wasted on burning coasters
We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!!  They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center!  Boxed it up and it's going right back where it came from.  If it's okay not to have battery back up, it might deserve a chance, however, what's the use in having an alarm clock if you can't trust that it will indeed wake you up
Before the repair process there was one bad track on my CD.  After the "repair" process the entire disk was unplayable.  Took it back for a refund. With billions of CDs in the world, is this the best that the 21st century has to offer?
Do NOT buy this product.  It is incredibly slow, by far the slowest USB drive out of the dozen or so that I've used.  It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files.  I attempted to copy ~50MB (1500 files, 800 directories) to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy!  That's roughly 27K/second.  Deleting the files was painful as well, taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything.  For kicks, I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds.  Bottom line is don't be fooled by the drive's small physical size, large capacity and price point: it simply doesn't perform
This remote is so hard to use and setup. The Xpress functions don't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time. Most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons, instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers. Get something else
Notice, all the happy....five star ratings, are from people that JUST bought this MP3. I have had mine for 9 months. I have had this MP3 since Christmas 2005. I bought the white 512 for my son at the same time. Whith in 3 weeks, my son's was no longer working at all, he had it in his back pack, and some how it got crunched enough to never work again!! I was not happy. Also in a few months, mine started to have issues. The very "tiny" menu button is rediculous. And the main toggle was a complete failure for Sony. I accually removed the cover to the toggle, and just moved the joy stick under it, to change songs, or volume. How stupid. I am so mad about this MP3 player. I am going to buy a Creative V. I have done a lot of research this time, and I will not buy another Sony. The hold button, that is part of this sliding door never works, I find the player dead in my gym bag, all the time!!! Apparently, the door slides over a bit, and the player will turn on, FOR HOURS, and than you have a dead player. Maybe Sony should have given us a on/off button, than this would not happen! Dont do it folks, look into other options, even my mom's iPod Nano is better designed than this joke of an MP3 player.
I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x.  Something is wrong with the DVDs because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner.  So if you are looking for 16x, do not buy this one
The product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car.  The mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it.  I have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail.  I will not purchase another thing from Amazon until my money is refunded
This isn't a consistent product. 99% of the time, I can't get it to work. After MONTHS of emails and phone calls, customer service responded. What a joke! They told me the plug in the unit and then unplug, wait 30 seconds, and then plug in. Gimme a break! I shouldn't have to do the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work. By the way, their process didn't work. Poor product, Poor customer service, Poor price
But I won't because I paid good money for it.  As you can see from the other reviews, the speed on this thing is pathetic, almost to the point of non-functional when it comes to many small files.  I had a small game on the drive, but it has tons of small files in the folder. It took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder... makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing. Stay away.. or if you really want one, buy mine please
This item was promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of Casio Exilim camera, but was never delivered. Now Amazon wants me to review it, so here your are..
This media did not work on my brand new asus burner, even after updating the firmware
I ordered the 2-year service plan on May 1st, this day (July 31st), I still have not recievied it. I have contacted them a number of times, and still nothing.  Do not buy from this company
Good thing first, efficient on battery,convenient and compact..doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge. Thats it.As most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in SONY. utterly non user friendly.I develop software for a living and I am not afraid to use new software...even though I was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy..I had 1gb of Atrac songs on this player from my computer. Then one day my computer HDD crashed. I was kind of thankful that I had saved atleast 1 GB of music on this bean walkman. Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did not go waste.As soon as I fixed the new HDD and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer..the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back...I tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me( a very indifferent group of people). It is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money.Of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and I dont want to go abt that..It is absolutely infuriating
N.E.W. will waste your time, money, and your every last nerve before repairing your product.  Eventually they will, but not without an exhausting, protracted fight
I bought the ADS upconverter because I bought a HDTV only to find out that my cable co. didn't offer HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer HDTV (too many trees around my house).  I wasn't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV picture, but for $550+ I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable.  When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought.  She looked at the TV and said okay I'm ready turn it on.  I said &quot;it IS ON!!&quot; This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it.  The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different, but that's all it was, different.  It was NOT noticably better.  In fact, in some instances I though the picture was worse.  I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for (even though that's not what I got it for).  So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter.  It didn't matter what display format I put it in it just didn't do anything to improve the picture.  Save your money.  If you can't get HDTV don't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing
This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all the features I need, but its mp3 player is really bad: Audio just pops before moving to a next song . It looks like what Philips' people just do in all of their electronics.  I really don't want to talk about this any more because William R. French and  A. Isaicu all talke about these problems
Sound quality was fine but this CD changer doesnt work well at all. I am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many others with the CD changer. Tried to play shuffle with all discs and it just stops playing after a while. It also has problems just changing to the next sequential CD. Apparently Sony didn't do proper quality testing on this product. I returned mine and after these other reviews won't be replacing it with a Sony. I hope this is a message to Sony. 
for $20 bucks...After finally figuring out that I had to turn my mic inputs ALL the way up, I still can't get more than a -20db signal from my guitar...Save your money..
are you serious?  I bought this a while ago to see if it was cool. It is a piece of junk, u can barely get any channels, and even if you do, you can barely see them and it has loud static.  dont buy it its garbage
I bought this product as a way to keep a large amount of backup data saved, however I have fought with the drivers for days now. Whenever the drive is working the usb on my computer does not work, if I try to use multiple computers on the same drives it crashes (even with the newest updates) I will be returning this product ASAP. I'm very disappointed and will not be buy netgear again! I only wish there was a 0 star revie
There are many aspects of the T5 people want to count as negatives. For me I consider them annoyances but not killers. I would like to have WiFi with my PDA but I am not dead with out it. More memory is always good but the T5 isn't on the hurting side. It's not a good mp3 player with the memory it has. And even if you have a 2G card with mp3's it's not like this is what you would buy for MP3s. But as far as contact information, on the go applications etc.. I would consider this as good as any other. The problem as I have just found out is these are known to die. I haven't heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the T5 will at some point Die. It will lock up and even after all the resets listed from Palm it will not come back to even a factory state. You will have a Palm Powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top. There are a couple of fixes. If you are under warranty you can send it back to Palm for them to make it better. Or you can remove the battery and solder it back. This is a serious design issue that Palm is more than happy to charge you for.Until I ran into this I would have rated this a 4/5. Until this happened the device did what I expected it to do. I read the box before buying it and knew it had some lack of cool factor with the no WiFi. But it has one of the fastest processors (available at that time) in a PDA. Which was a different type of cool. The bluetoothworks well enough I haven't had any issues with it. You can surf the net with bluetooth so wifi isn't really that big of a deal.But if you can't trust your device is going to be working the next day it really doesn't matter what cool feature it has. This has been a very expensive let down.I don't want to buy another Palm after this experience but I am not sure what toswitch to...
I ordered the A1500 and received the A1000. I opted not to send it back when I read the other feedback on this page. I didn't want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed (as the other fellow did below). Amazon is usually pretty good, not this time, and not on this product.If you want, you can call them at: 1.800.201.7575 (Toll free, US and Canada)1.206.346.2992 or 1.206.266.2992 (Outside US and Canada)1.877.586.3230 (Canada only)UK customer service: +44.208.636.9200
There's a reason this thing is only 6 bucks.  It's absolute junk.  I put it into the cassette player in my car, and the sounds were completely distorted.  The voice constantly skips, and the casette sometimes clicks.  The quality of sound in my car is usually amazing, and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device.  I've tried both sides, but still no avail.  I plan on returning it if shipping doesn't cost more than the product itself
Nice product before they decided to save a few pennies - I have purchased seven, but now it is made with out the handle - so if that was part of the atraction of this case, note that the discription says 'sturdy padded handle' -- NOT!5 STARS if it still had the handle or if you don't need one
This is just a general review, of all DVD cases. I have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs. I was stationed in Germany for over 2 years, and anyone who had been there knows that AFN sucks, so DVD's is your only source of video entertainment. My collection grew to more than 400. I have been trying to find a good case, that hold equal number of title books as it does DVD's. But that seems to be asking to much, or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers, you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly?????  Then when you look at the furniture options, everything seems to be made for function, and not style at all, they are generally pressboard P.O.S's and nothing I would want to keep in my garage.......... I hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions, cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to be satisfied!!!!!

After using these radios two months I can say that battery life is poor.A full charge doesn't hold three hours.Perhaps my batteries didn't come in good condition. I didn't use them on AAA yet... 10 mile range is not true in a normal environment, open sea or desert perhaps.Product works fine while battery las
The principal benefit of this product is in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at the product reviews. I was never able to get the card to do anything. I tried removing and reinstalling the drivers. I tried getting assistance through the web site. I tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my phone call. I've decided to cut my losses and buy a different card
Bought it for my wife - the pink just didn't match anything in my wardrobe...She uses her player for the gym, and treats it somewhat rough.  This "case" doesn't protect the screen from scratches (see most other reviews), but it hasn't fallen off while she's worn it, either.  About 1/2 useful, really.On the other hand....it was cheap, right?  Right?
It worked OK for 2 months, but the KB kept on falling off. When I complained, I was told that the KB was not compatible with my Viewsonic v37. Yet, it was advertised as compatible with the VS PPC 2002. The worse came when I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stopped working. I contacted Targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC. I do not believe that this should be permitted. If you sell something, stand behind it. Very disappointing
I just purchased this item -  now I'm planning to return it tomorrow.  One of the advertised features, the ability to store liner notes just doesn't work properly.  They just don't into the pocket without bending and/or forcing them in.  To me, the liner notes have value and I'm not willing to fold, spindle, or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet
This printer has been a piece of garbage since the day I bought it. I don't know why I kept trying, as the purchase was made about a year ago. It should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and I would have cut my losses (instead I did buy one more package of paper and ink. Mistake.) I have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message, turning the printer off, turning it back on, doing that several times, and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day. Now it says the cartridge should be replaced, when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge (and I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures, which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridge. I have printed about 6.) The ironic thing is, the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful. The one that I printed today was perfect. But several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours. This is the last time I try to use the printer, it is finally going in the trash
The only good thing I can say is the print quality is fine and the wireless network works.  But...software installation is long and tedious (and took three times on one laptop to get to work). Installed drivers cause my PC to take 45+ seconds longer to boot and sometimes (about 30%) stop the shut-down sequence (I have to click "end" in a dialogue box).  The ink runs out (even the big black one) amazingly quickly and replacements are $54 at Costco.  It seems you gotta get ONLY HP cartridges, as third-party cartridges fail.  I'll never buy another HP printer
I am on my 2nd unit and both lockup after a short time. Neither the remote nor the front buttons will work when it locks up. You have to unplug it and leave it unplugged for at least 5 minutes - maybe longer.  It works good when it is working
Easy to set up and worked great for 2 months then it just stopped working.  Horrible customer service!  Will never buy from this company again!
Hard to believe this product is still being sold when it's not even friendly with the current hot selling ipods.  Also the claims of good design I feel are overstated.  Finally the speakers are weak and sound like it won't be long until they're shaking, this may influence what music you'll end up playing through the system.All said, though, I'd be happy with it for the price if only they'd update it to fully handle my ipod
I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman
I do not leave feedback of any kind on amazon.com, but this time as I was listening to my car audio today, I was compelled to leave one for others. This product is probably the worst of any electrical equipments I bought for mp3 player/audio system. Its sound reproducing/transmission from mp3 player to car audio is of inferior quality. It does not balance well the low/high frequency sounds, resulting in dampened sound with absolutely no clarity. Mine worked ok for the first several hours I assume. I think it damaged the speaker, and it now sounds like it's going to rip apart. Someone else left review explaing this trouble, which I ignored, which was a mistake. Again, don't buy.
I bought this item because Amazon never had the 3M model I wanted in stock.  So I settled for this one.  That was a big mistake.  The wheels on this stand are only about 8 inches apart which makes your CPU very unstable.  The spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the CPU.  It is really a two person operation.  Finally, if your CPU has a side access panel, you will have to remove it from the stand to gain access since the stand uses a pressure fit to hold it to the computer.  Take a look at the 3M CS100 stand.  I think it is a much better design
I bought two Lexar thumbdrives, over other brands, partially based on their rebate offers. Despite my methodical record keeping and submission, I simply got post cards saying that I did not "meet" the rebate requirements (in place of the rebate checks).  The first time it happened, I thought it was, oh well, my fault, But the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission. This is simply frank fraud by Lexar, on a smaller scale, therefore not worth customers' time to file a complaint or to pursue it further. I hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again
While I'm driving, this thing doesn't work at all. There's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time. The only time this FM transmitter works is when my car is still. Maybe it's because my antenna is on the back of my rear window and the transmitter can't reach it. Overall, I'd say this product is garbage
Has anyone else experienced the following ?: Used the first twenty or so in a stack of 100 without any problems, then have run into (so far) a run of at least 30 defective discs after the remainder sat unused for a few months. After various attempts to narrow down the problem, I tracked it down to the blank CD-Rs. I had exactly the same problem occur with another brand, which was replaced with these TDKs. Is there some unwritten shelf life for blank CD-Rs or am I just unlucky?
I purchased this to work with my Xbox 360, I wanted to try this cable type with my new Onkyo 7.1 home theater since I was using the old composite for sound. I heard more disortion and fuzz then if you but a soda can in a blender. I qucikly ran to Best Buy to buy a Monster fiber optical cable it was about 50.00 dollars more. But then the sound was incredible I couldn't beleive what I was hearing. I gave it two stars since the cables build was so so but not half as thick as Monsters. (Maybe I got a bad model give it a shot it's only a couple dollars)
I bought this last Christmas for my three year old and five year old.  Thesound of the piano is a little off, but all in all the piano is nice for the price.  The leg of the stool breaks very easily.  Don't buy unless you can fix
We bought this machine for a Christmas present for the inlaws, knowing I'd wind up installing it. The first disk played fine, but while I was eating lunch my father-in-law tried moving to a different CD. It wouldn't play. It'd go back to the first disk and play it fine. So, I shut it down, restarted on disk 2 and now it played fine, but wouldn't go back and play disk 1! I moved the disks around to other slots and still they skipped like an old-fashioned vinyl record with a scratch. Both CDs worked fine in another player. In the meantime, mother-in-law is busy putting her collection of CDs into groups for me to program. Not this holiday season. This sucker's going back to the big box store from wence it came!
Should have believed all the other negative reviews.  Didn't work in my Honda Civic and didn't work in my Nissan Altima, both with original manufacturer tape decks.  In both cases, the tape deck whirred for a bit, then ejected the SmartDeck
Obviously, it's cheap. But I've had mine over a year now.... no it hasn't failed, but it does scare me.  besides the plastic cracking, the fan is making me nervous.  About half the time now when I turn it on the fan make this really loud buzzing noise, which changes frequency over time, slowing down.  I have a bad feeling that the fan is not held in alignment well, and that the loud noise is the fan blades scraping against their surroundings (because it vibrates quite a bit).  This vibration can only mean bad things for the drive inside, and I'm not looking forward to the day when my cheapo choice of enclosure causes my HD to crash and lose all my photos, music, backups, etc.Currently shopping for a replacement, and I would not recommend this
I have owned the DMR-ES40V for over 6 months. It is a combo DVD/VCR unit. I have had sufficient time to become intimately familiar with the pros and cons of the unit. The MANUAL:  It is imperative to have the manual. This machine is somewhat complicated, and frequent trips to the instructions is necessary. If everything is working correctly, you can usually find the instructions that you need somewhere in it. It is overly time-consuming though, since the items don't seem to logically flow. If you dig long and hard enough though, they are in there somewhere.The SET-UP: Being somewhat experienced at setting-up a home theater, this was generally easy. The text and pictures were sufficient. Searching through the Function Menu, I learned that to perform the same action and different levels required using different imput buttons. This is needlessly confusing. Of course the auto clock set function isn't very accurate ( I haven't seen an accurate one yet). DVD PLAYBACK: The general playback is pretty straight-forward. I really miss some of the extra playback features that are on my JVC progressive player (which is 3 years older). Finding a scene in a movie is comparatively difficult. A Zoom feature is missing. Many convenience features are not present. DVD RECORDING: Recording onto a DVD-RAM disc is a dream compared to old fashioned VCR tapes. I really enjoy using them. A quirk--you must have the unit in stand-by to record from the scheduler. This mandates that to watch a recorded show while recording another(on the same disc) you must wait until the unit begins recording, then select the show to watch from the Navigator. The UHF tuner has some trouble recording somewhat weak signals from channel 19. Other weak channels record but not 19. This problem started about 6 months after initial set-up. There is an annoying bug with Daylight Savings Time, and the newer extended time period. The Panasonic Web Site suggests going into the set-up menu and unchecking the DST box; thus removing the feature. If this did anything, it would allow you to set the clock manually. Being without the automatic DST adjustment would not be annoying, but even though you turn-off this feature it still resets your clock twice a day at noon and at 7pm EST. This ruins any TV scheduling you had set. This malady persisted until the date of the former DST Spring-Ahead arrived. Several weeks of scheduling hell! I requested assistance from customer service but never received the telephone call that was promised. No message, no number to call--just a promise to call again when I was home. THE VCR USE: This feature is really buggy. You are supposed to be able to eject a cassette with the remote; but this only worked for a month or two. When a TV show is scheduled for recording the unit won't tape it if you merely insert a cassette. It doesn't recognize the insertion of the cassette unless the tape has been made to move--either playing a little or fast forwarding/reversing. This is really annoying.LAST IMPRESSION: The last movie (Last King of Scotland) I watched took over the machine. The remote control would not function, the disc would not stop, and the disc could not be ejected. It was necessary to unplug the unit, restart it, eject the disc, and totally reset all menu items--which were randomly reset to various settings. Worse some settings are no longer selectable. One other movie would not even play in the machine--forcing me to use the trusty JVC unit. I must say that this machine has many of the same problems that are still occurring in the new units from what I read at this forum and other ones. These units are being released for sale way before they are ready for public consumption. I recommend looking elsewhere.
I bought this printer based on its good reviews. It does print beautiful photos BUT I haven't used it that hard for it to have failed so soon. Canon said they will send me a factory refurbished replacement for the body only. The problem began with a squeak in the rollers and yesterday it would not feed the paper properly. After several attempts to get it working per the instructions in the manual I contacted Canon. They ran me through a test with the machine after which they said the only thing they would do is send the replacement body
The phone was very annoying. Everytime I tried to call on the phone, it would not connect. I would have to either change the channel or just not call. I was only able to connect to the number I was calling once in the 30+ times I attempted to call. I returned the phone and went and purchase a different manufactured phone. Consumers Report was very wrong in their rating of this phone. The phone was terrible !
J&R packs them so poorly that over half of them were shattered beyond repair upon arrival
As the title, it not worth the money at all even at such a low price. The picture quality is bad, very bad. I'd rather spend this money for other web-cam
I sent it back. The price was right but the caller ID didn't function. When I got in touch with AT&T, they told me, maybe this phone is not compatible with the other phones in my home. (Stupid Response!) I then asked, why would AT&T put a phone on the market that's not compatible with my other phones, I didn't get a reply!!! They wanted to send me a replacement. I told them there is no point in doing that, if, the replacement phone was not compatible with my other phones! I guess AMAZON will be sending it back to AT&T
I ordered the unit twice, and twice I received a Carrying Case. not the adapter.  I returned both and ordered direct from Cobra.  When I had called customer support for Amazon the second time, I got connected to India of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong.  I guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says.
I was very disappointed when I got to South America and went to curl my hair and nothing happened.  Take a look at the product specifications.  It has limited use for appliances between 500 and 1600 watts. I had two different curling irons with me - one was rated 85 watts and the other 125 watts.  I am not sure what appliances this converter was designed for.  Take my recommendation.  Buy the converter by Tumi instead.  It is twice the price, but it is one piece, easy to travel, and works with many different types of appliances. I am very satisfied with it.
I have been using this drive for 5 months and recently upgraded my computer to Windows Vista.  As a result of the Windows upgrade, this product just lost half its value for me.  The drive works fine physically, but the included backup software will not work with Vista when I try to schedule an overnight backup; the software refuses to recognize that you have selected files for backup and refuses to move past that point of the scheduling.  As others have noticed here, Western Digital offers ZERO support for its software - I cannot even find an indication that they recognize there is a problem
if you can make it work or if you are lucky to get a non defective unit:it can only read 1 card at a timeneeds specific usb power requirements (needs the usb power be +5v and not +5vsb) else you will get "USB hub power exceeded errors" the worst part is that the mainboard i tested is +5v... and still didn't workthe cards inserted on the lower card slots have to be inserted upside downfrom time to time you can get the message usb device not recognized...contacted support... service there = average/not so good (support forum has several topics complaining about this product)couldn't get a replacement since 30 days tigerdirect warranty have expired, can't send the unit to ultra because currently I'm outside the US and as i stated customer service is not good.bottom linedon't buy this item
I am glad I purchased my Cardscan 700, but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all.  My impression is that this is the best product on the market, due to its scanning properties, which are quite good.  There are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed, and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless, since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place.PROs: It does a pretty good job of scanning.  The algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive.  Even cards that catch and rotate as they go through, producing a funny smeared image, have some of their contents scanned correctly.  The superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product.  There is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards.  Operationally the product is especially nice- I can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one, glancing at the screen to catch errors.  The card image is retained in the record in the Cardscan database, which is important. CONs: 1) the exit path has places that cards can hang up, and they can catch as they go through.  This happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat, so part of the operation is to try to prevent that, by straightening out bent corners ahead of time, and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck.  Quite needless- if the exit path was smooth and continuous, this wouldn't happen - the problem is in the rear of the plastic case.  2) Although the product retains the image of the business card, there's no way to pass that through to Outlook or export it to any other format.  This is very unfortunate.  I could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one, except that Cardscan software does not permit copy / paste functions on the image.  Why not?  It's easy to implement.  3) Every time I start the program it harasses me about registering, even though I've been specific that I do not wish to.  It also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though I've asked it not to do that.  It therefore ignores the user wishes.  4) The data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file, in a simple text or csv format.  There is no way to create an Outlook format .pst file, which would simplify importing, and allow for the future option of including an image.  Outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record, but apparently Cardscan folks aren't even close to thinking about this.  5) If I indicate that a data export for a file is destined for Outlook, the field names are not set up correctly, so unless I do some heavy editing of field names, nothing much other than the contact name gets across.  If I export directly to the running Outlook program, it isn't perfect, but it's close enough to be usable.  Why did Cardscan get one right and not the other??  In neither case can I send the card image over.  6) I was forced to install Microsoft .NET software even though I intended to do all my exports via files.  I didn't get a choice- if I didn't install .NET, the installer stopped and exited without installing any Cardscan software.
I spent two days tried to have it formatted by my Powerbook G4 and set up a wireless network to replace my Microsoft wireless router.  No luck.  It is on the shelf ever since. People at the Genius Bar in local apple store may be able to help but it is too much troubel.To set up other routers with a PC you can easily hire some one to set it up for you at your home for a couple of hundred dollars.  Not Apple.  If you don't have time don't buy this product. 
Why not sell the thing with a battery, it's a special battery, not available in the boonies, so I have a choice....Drive 30 miles or wait another week for a battery to come in the mail.  Iknow, Iknow in the text it does say battery not included but who reads that?  So for the folks who read this... BUY A BATTERY TOO!!!
I purchased this cable and the pins were weak and clumsy.  I could not even plug it in and one of the pins broke.  I threw it away.  It is a piece of junk
tapes are cheaply priced and the picture quality offered by them is even cheaper.i say if your doing everyday recording and dont care about the quality these tapes are for you.but if you wanna save your favorite movie or show jvc or fuji is the way to go they both offer incredible picture and sound quality
I use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the GPS-360 device further down the dashboard. This adapter apparently can't sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle. I've only used it twice - first time, it snapped off the back half of the cradle and the second time finished off the front half. The connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable, but I'm going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again. I don't want the connector to snap off next
The new iPods do not have the connections to work with FireWire. So this cable will only charge the new iPods with video. Besides this this is a good product for the iPods
When I first got this camera, I was satisfied.  It is complicated to use (definitely not intuitive) because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want.  However, it took pretty good pictures.  However, soon after the warranty expired, it began to overexpose pictures and we couldn't stop it from doing that.  We tried to contact Fuji but have gotten no response.  My wife found that this is a common problem (overeposure and lack of response from Fuji), which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell.  Hopefully, they have fixed the problem but I wouldn't bet my money on it.  This camera has given us more frustration than it is worth
It was time to get a new cordless phone and I bought this because it was on sale, and featured hard number buttons -- I find it more difficult to dial phones with soft, squishy buttons. Bad decision. You can't hear anyone even with the volume set to maximum, the answering system is just as bad in terms of registering voices, and apparently no one can hear me. I plugged in my headset to the jack, and they can hear me, but I can't hear them. There is static everywhere -- you can't use it in range of fluorescent lights, TVs, computers, speakers, etc. In a small house with compact fluorescent bulbs everywhere, try that! This phone is worthless and if I can return it, I will
This product didn't work with my wireless mouse, scanner, and it would mess up my print que and I would have to restart the Keyspan software to get it working again.I returned it
I spent $60 on this and it broke after 6 months.. I guess the old saying, "you get what you paid for" is true. :(
I wish I had read the Amazon reviews of this item before I paid $19 for it at an office supply store. It may seem a bit trivial, but the smell of this wrist pad was a deal breaker. It's unfortunate, too, because everything else about it is perfect: the color, the comfortable gel support and soft fabric, and the size (it runs the length of my Mac keyboard and provides support when I use my mouse). But the smell: a piercing, toxic smell that does not go away. It doesn't matter if I spend five minutes or five hours in front of my computer, I still smell the synthetic backing of the wrist pad, and it's made it impossible for me to work. I finally had to get rid of it
I purchased these earphone to use for swimming with a otterbox and an ipod shuffle.  They are were very uncomfortable from the start, but I could listen to music.  That didn't last long.  The connection would not hold and if I didn't hold it together, the music faded out. Also, music faded in and out from ear to ear. I finally gave up and bought earbud waterproof earphones that have worked quite well and cost less
I purchased this product to share my DVI monitor and Logitech Bluetooth keyboard/mouse between my two main machines - the exact use promoted by the manufacturer.  I successfully patched the firmware to eliminate the incessant beeping, but am extremely disappointed with the DVI video at 1600 by 1200 (severe streaking and noise), and the audio is totally unuseable given the severe hum and noise.  BTW, I am using Belkin KVM cables.Don't even THINK about purchasing this unit
We used the CD player one time.  The next time we attempted to use it, it would not play the CD. We ended up having to return it because it was defective
I purchased the MD781 + MD71 expansion phone after briefly having its predecessor the MD681.  I really like the MD681 but I could never locate one of its expansion handsets (everyone online/offline was constantly out of stock).  Overall I'm disappointed with this new model and after two weeks of use I am already looking for another phone.  Handheld phones:  I like them more than any other phone I've tried.  Unlike most phones these days they're big and have a very solid feel to them...it's just easier to hold onto a phone like this for a longer conversation.  The buttons are a nice size and easy to use. The hands free/speak phone on the handheld works well. With one person on a handheld line the sound is pretty good, but with two people on handsets you get significant background noise that is so bad it hurts your ear and it's hard to hear the person on the other end of the conversation.The shared phonebook is a terrific idea but it could have been done better. It's a few clicks and slow to access...almost as quick to have the old rolodex on hand...or copy the number to the local units phonebook...which defeats the purpose.As for the Answer Machine:  Once you play messages you no longer have a visible indicator of  how many messages, if any, are in the system (is it just me or is that poor design), so if you listen to messages when you partner isn't around you need to leave a note for them to check messages.   The quality of voice messages is a bit grainy.I also like how the handset docked in the older M681;  it laid on the base so you had the option of wall mounting the base...the MD781 sits up on the base like some sort of obelisk.
FM transmitters of this size don't last forever. That is a fact I accept but I had hoped it would last longer than 2 weeks. I bought my first one from Target before a road trip in a uhaul without a cd player. The sound was marginal at best and by the end of the three day drive to Oregon it was extremely noisy. I plugged it in to my computer to transmit some streaming stations and it had trouble hitting the receiver (direct line of sight) no more than 40 feet away. Two more days and it crackled its last and died. I exchanged the transmitter at Target for a new one and a week and a half later I was returning that one as well. Spend a few extra bucks, save yourself the hassle and get a Belkin.
The product didn't do what it said it would. I cut the power to use it in my car (I shouldn't have assumed it worked properly) so I couldn't return it and ended wasting $50. I was extremly dissapointed in this product
I doubt that they are all this bad.  Maybe I just got &quot;lucky&quot;.  The first time I put the tape in, the motor could hardly pull the tape.  When I tried to record, it played back all shaky, like a playing a record off-center on a turntable.  I returned it
I will never buy a brand new product release from Linksys again. Their Q.C. stinks. I am on the third WRT54GX4 router and it is the first that was not defective. I got it set up and tried my new WPC54GX4 network card(SRX400) and got a weak signal, but I had my second laptop with a WPC54GX card(SRX200) on the desk getting 100% signal strength. I switched cards in the two computers, and the old SRX200 card was better in either computer(both XP Pro). After hours with semi-English speaking techs, they came to the same conclusion I came to in five minutes...a bad antenna in the new WPC54GX4. So once again Amazon will replace a defective Linksys product for me. I had been a Linksys fan in the past, but not any more. Here's a link to a picture of the first router I got and its defect.http://vowe.net/archives/006639.htm
This router has been in operation for about 3 weeks.  When it is functioning correctly, it is a pleasure to use.  Unfortunately, it requires almost daily power cycling to keep it running - all the idiot lights show normal operation, but there's no wired or wireless connectivity until it's power cycled
The bag is very nice looking, nice material, everybody loves it.  Lots of compartments inside fit all accessories I need plus some documents.  But the top part (the zipper) is a BIG problem, it just has to get 200% in a way, while the notebook pocket doesn't provide any flexibility.  I just have to scratch my brand new notebook in and out, very frustrating.  (same as another review here).  My opinion, find another one, I'm gonna do it myself
I did not like the fact that this microphone needs a hard to find battery which is not included in the box it was sold
The range on this product is no where near what was advertised.  I purchased (2) units and neither will work consistently beyond 4-5 feet from mac.  Attempted to improve operation by relocating mac, using USB extension cable, and changing ID on transmitter with no improvement.  Extremely disappointed
I didn't purchase this one...it was a gift. I was hoping for a laser printer like one of the Brother All-In-Ones.I opted to install the Lite version of the software from hp.com. I would suggest that everyone do this. The Lite version only has the drivers, none of the HP bull software that is included usually.The thing that bothered me the most was the Automatic Document Feeder. I would start a scan job and everything is going fine, and then on the 5th or 6th page the whole process would just hang. I had over 500 pages of documents to scan, and this machine really let me down.Amazing how Hewlett-Packard can't even write reliable drivers.I gave the item 2 stars because I got it to print sometimes. No buy
the alarms don't pay any attention to the settings in sounds and notifications. they repeat twice and then quit. the light doesn't flash except the first time. half of the time they don't work. i sent it back for repair and they didn't do a thing to it but send it back to me the next day. same problem, it is the way it is designed but they won't admit it
Followed the instructions to the letter.  PCs would not work once connected and even worse stopped XP starting up - had to go back to restore point.  Belkin email support is next to useless.  I would strongely recommend buying a KVM product from another supplier
I would love to try this. First one was shipped broken (make a clanking noise and woulnd't work). Sent it back and got a new one that didn't read a DVD.  I may try one more time.Its pretty heavy, but I am hoping the larger screen is better then other small portables or i-pod type machines
I bought 2 of these and they are horrible!  Youu put them in and they sometimes work and sometimes dont its such a pain in the arse!
I bought it, and USB was fine, but the FireWire ports didn't work.  Lost time and money sending it in for warranty service
This drive has a great aesthetic design, but did not work out of the box when I received it. Amazon delivered promptly as usual, but quality of this product is definitely lacking. Look at the Western Digital... that's what I now have and have had no issues.
300-500 yards under the best conditions. Given its heft, a waste of mone
It seems nice enough and it's cheap, but it is apparently incompatible with the Canon Powershot Digital Elphs. For use with those cameras, buy Sandisck instead. Seriously
Purchased a total of 20 of these. I previously sold the American International brand Sirius antenna but there was a temporary shortage in the market.Four of the twenty Terk brand units were dead on installation. Sadly, I thought Terk was a quality brand. My mistake!
I bought this router hoping that some of the quality in Cisco's excellent enterprise-market routers would have worn off on adopted child Linksys.  Unfortunately, my experience has me convinced that Linksys is a red-headed stepchild (my apologies to all you red-heads) who has learned very little from its adoptive parent.That being said, the router does work out of the box, and it is probably about par for current market offerings on home-network routers.  My perusals of the DSL reports hardware forums have left me with the impression that all sub-$300 routers on the market suffer their quirks and behavioral anomalies, and this one is certainly no exception.Pros:This router is configured to work right out of the box.  You can pretty much just connect the cables and turn it on, and have functional connectivity without ever looking at a configuration screen.The HTML-based configuration interface is incredibly easy to use.  You don't have to learn one single command line to configure this router.Default configuration was stealth mode -- meaning the router did not respond to _any_ unsolicited connection requests, forming a protective "black hole" on my IP for most uninvited packets.Cons:Not all of the features worked out of the box.  Several of the links in the HTML command pages simply did not link to anything.  Strange that Linksys would ship the firmware without at least taking 30 minutes to hide the links that don't point to anything.Turning on the poorly documented "firewall" feature causes the router to respond irregularly to unsolicited connection requests.  Sometimes the router responds "port closed" to all requests.  Sometimes it responds "port closed" to some and "port open" to others (the set of which does not remain consistent from one trial to the next).  Never does it maintain the stealth operation of its default configuration (with "firewall" inactive).  I'm not sure how the "firewall" in this router is configured to behave, but my initial tests suggest it is more security hindrance than feature.The router's DHCP functionality works great -- when it works.  It mysteriously disengages at random intervals, requiring a reboot (and sometimes a flash to factory defaults) to remedy.Flashing a new BIOS image is risky; router failure during a flash means shipping the router back to the manufacturer - or File13, if the warranty is out.For what it's worth, I am still using this router.  It serves its basic purpose, and while its functionality issues are annoying, there are workarounds for all of them.  I probably will not buy another Linksys, but the problems with this one aren't annoying enough to warrant a return.-sean hennin
I purchased this to replace my 10 year-old Bel 846i, and was really disappointed.It is difficult to tell in the picture, but the portion of the detector that appears light grey is actually kind of silver. On its own, I wouldn't particularly like the color scheme, but what makes the design terrible s that the shiny silver reflects on your windshield. I can't believe they'd think this was a good idea. For some reason, I was getting false laser alerts like crazy -- empty subdivisions, on the expressway without a police car in sight, parking lots... At first, I thought my phone might be interfering with the detector, but I was getting just as many falses with the phone turned off.I'd expect this with a Cobra detector that cost half as much, but this is pretty terrible. Based on other reviews, I don't think this is isolated to a defective unit.
Product arrived damaged.  Company (ANTOnline)was unwilling to exchange for new item.  Would never buy from them again
I bought this drive in late 2003, and it's gone through a moderate amount of use in a home environment since then. The positives first - though it has an 8MB buffer it is very fast, and can even stand its ground against some newer disks with larger buffers. It does make quite a bit of noise and heats up a bit more compared to my older 40gig and 20gig WD's, and the newer seagates. 2.5 years after purchase, the drive started corrupting files like crazy. WD has tools on their site to check your disk status, and sure enough it was due for an RMA. When I checked the warranty status online, 6 months had mysteriously 'vanished' from my warranty period. The drive warranty had started 6 months before I'd purchased it! Anyway, it was still valid and they sent me a replacement very quick.Still, this is my second WD drive to die, and I'm going with other brands from now.
I am very happy with my Meridian Color and the other mapsend products I have purchased, however, at first I couldnt get this product to work.I had no problem getting this software to run with XP (even without the patch), however I couldnt view the basemap I had loaded onto my Magellan.  I tried to address this with the company.  It has been three days now and they have not even returned my emails.  Customer service for this product is nonexistant.I joined the Yahoo message board and got a simple answer to my question in about four hours someone posted the answer.  Turns out I just had to go to the Menu -- Card Utilities and maunually select the basemap.  I did not know that basemaps dont change automaticaly like the detailed maps do.I cannt say enough great things about my experience with my magellan meridian color though.  Navigating through Hungary like a pro, I didnt miss a single turn.  I would never recommend any of their products to someone who isnt willing or doesnt have the aptitude to learn about it.  The Magellan Meridian series is in my opinion the finest product on the market for what it does, portability it provides and is 100 percent upgradable with new software and new maps.Get you head out of your a__ Thales.  You have some great products, but you are blowing your customer support base with non existant customer support.  I recommend anyone with a question about softward or the GPS join the yahoo groups and post the question there.  Dont waste your time with customer support.
The printer works great as a usb printer, a fax machine, and copier.It may as well not even have a network port on it.The networking driver will find the printer ,but then it goes back to searching for a printer, and this loop continues till you give up.I can't tell if thr network scanning works because of the above driver problem.I can tell you that a Dell 1600 works great as a network printer, network scanner, fax & copier. We have 3 of these and we tried this Hp 3055 and I would not reccommend it to anyon
While I have been very pleased with the performance of this product, configuration and setup was very easy, and even updates to the device are easy to do, it's not reliable.It seems that every 3 or 4 days I lose connection to the Internet. This is a 7 PC network, couple of servers.  There really isn't huge bandwidth being used.  But it is like it gets frozen - you can't ping it, you can't get to anything on the outside like the gateway or DNS servers, and a simple power reset gets it working again.Nothing is in the log, I have to believe this is some sort of firmware problem.  I have checked all the ideas on Netgear's site without help. I know at least some of the time it freezes during the middle of the night, when no one is using it.  Could it be getting zapped from the outside somehow? But it sure is not reliable, I can't recommend it
I find these ear buds to be absolutely uncomfortable. I would rate the product a zero if it were an option. I can't even use them because they're too uncomfortable to wear. Not worth the money, even though they're cheap
After reading a number a positive reviews on the product, I wanted to try it.  I am glad I just went to my local Whole Foods Supermarket, instead of paying excessive ship/g costs when ordering online.  Basically, I do Not like it...don't like the taste or texture; I am not really bothered by the smell once it is rinsed.  I eat Tofu products regularly and I also eat pasta occasionally and would rather eat my whole wheat pasta 1-2x/mth than eat this tofu-noodle regularly.  However, everyone has different tastes. So if you want to try it, get it from your local grocer (if they carry it), otherwise don't waste your money on ship/g

I was very disappointed. It has a definite after taste. I was surprised at the small container size. After tasting I was glad it was small. Would I order it again? Yuck!
We were  really looking forward to having some Omaha Steaks again. Unfortunately, every steak had grissle and was very tuff. The flavor was not what we remebered either, they were very bland. I could have gotten a better steak at the supermarket and saved myself alot of money
I really prefer the Shoumei Green Tea which is one of the only green teas I can find that isn't bitter. The white tea doesn't have any sweetness to it and isn't much fun to drink. I only drink it because it's good for me.
I find tomatoes to be overrated.  They're an important ingredient in many things, obviously, but as an item themselves they're of limited use.  They taste alright, but their texture is too screwed up.  The only time I ever really eat raw tomatoes is on hamburgers and sandwiches, and usually prefer not to have them, as they destablilize the whole sandwich so that it all falls apart.  Obnoxious, that is
Years ago, these really were ground steak burgers with a very special flavor.  The most recent shipment I had was tastless with an unusually chewy texture.  Not recommended
Personally, I didn't like Tazo's Red Bush Tea very much.  I've had three different kinds of roiboos teas so far and this was my least favorite.  It seems like the flavor of roiboos itself is pretty mild, and in the case of Tazo's tea, the flavors they add completely overwhelm it.  I found that I had to remove the tea bag very quickly lest the cup become overwhelmingly lemony and acidic.  Perhaps other pallettes will appreciate the strength of those flavors.  Personally, I couldn't wait to finish off the box so that I could find a better flavor.The other roiboos teas I have tried have had a milder mix of flavors, to a much better overall effect.  My personal choice right now is Trader Joe's Orange Spice Roiboos, which apparently can be bought in some, but not all of their stores.  The orange flavor is much less up front than the lemon & citrus flavors in the tazo tea, and the overall effect of the other spices is very nice.  The tea smells a lot like other spiced foods (pumpkin pie comes to mind) and is very nice on a gloomy afternoon.  Also unlike the Tazo version, the flavor of this tea gets nicer and richer the longer you let the tea bag steep, although even just pouring the water over the bag and leaving it for a few seconds is usually enough for a nice cup.  Admittedly, there are a lot of other roiboos teas I have not tried, but this one has been a hit with me because of its good flavor and local availability.Keep in mind this is not the opinion of a tea expert, and I have never had roiboos tea in Africa so I don't know what it is supposed to taste like in its authentic presentation.  Just my personal taste
We were happy with the gift baskets that were delivered. However the company only has one distribution center in California, which is obviously not efficient to deliver to the East Coast. Despite the company's ambitions to become a national company, they are not willing to pony up the money to get additional distribution facilities outside of California. This maybe great if you live in California. However I live in Florida and I ordered on December 22 and my basket did not arrive until January 4th. I think that would be unacceptable in anyone's view, espescially since giving a gift basket can be time-sensitive. Until this company gets with the program and gets other distribution facilities I would stay away unless you want to wait two weeks for a simple basket to be delivered.
I have liked other Hot Pockets, like the ham and cheese is not bad if you spread some mustard on them but I think they over spiced the Pizza Hot Pockets. They taste kind of strong and weird
I must admit, the first one that I ate was indeed tasty though slightly undercooked.  However, the second one was much less cooked and when I went to cut it, blood from the sausage squirted into my eye.  Now I am beside myself because I remembered my wife going on one night about blood- borne diseases.  I am scared that I might have unwittingly acquired Hepatitus or AIDS.  My wife told me not to worry because the animals the sausages are made from do not carry these diseases.  I refuse to take any chances because my wife and I are having problems.  I still await the results from the blood tests my doctor ordered.
What is the weight of this product?  Am I paying for one ounce or one pound?It's frustrating to be about to place an order and find vital info is missing.Catherine in Yuma, A
I have to agree with the guy who complained about consistency.  I have wasted two very expensive pods so far.  The first time I used a Kona pod the machine jammed and I could not open it for 24 hours,(caused a steam lock), about 5 tablespoons of undrinkable crap came out of my senseo.  The next time I tried a Kona pod I got a quarter amount of what should have been a two cup try. I am not very impressed so far.  I am now afraid to try again.
The prime rib slices I had were pre-cooked and they are terrible. Nothing like what you would expect from a good restaurant or make at home. They lack in both flavor and texture. The remaining slices I have will probably be sliced up and used in tacos
Rice paper crumbles off-- possible due to product being very old or improperly stored. Disappointing
I like marshmallows, I like them plain in hot cocoa and I like them toasted, and as a fan of jelly beans I tasted this toasted marshmallow flavored jelly bean from Jelly belly and I didn't like this flavor at all. I personally didn't think It really tasted all that much like toasted marshmallows and was just kind of weird tasting
I picked up a 1 Oz tin of same brand for 14.99 in Dallas are
I ordered what I thought was matcha tea powder. a comment on the page said it was SLIGHTLY sweetened, no specific nutritional info was available when looking to order. on the info when the tea arrived was a calorie count of 393cal/serving, and ingredients which include corn syrup solids and partial hydrogenated oils. not what I was expecting from a green tea powder. would NOT recommend
I thought I would be receiving bread, but I thought wrong. Rocks, I received rocks. And there is no softening them up either. Nor do they contain any ham. Just hard rocks
This cocoa is gritty and has a bitter taste.  The dark chocolate mint is particularly bitter.  We don't care for the chocolate raspberry and chocolate vanilla flavors either.  The chocolate supreme flavor is sweeter and tastier than the other flavors, but the child in our family still remarked that his cocoa "tasted strange".  There are many non-gourmet commercial mixes that are smoother, more palatable and less expensive than this gourmet brand.  We won't buy this cocoa again.  This gift box selection is very handsomely packaged and looks great in holiday gift baskets. But the cocoa fails the taste test.  
When I received the item the box was busted open and all the cookies in both packages were crushed up.  One of the packages was open and leaking cookies dust all over my car when I pulled it out of the mailing box.  On top of that the one or two cookies that were salvaged were stale!  Ill never order anything from this company again!!!  My entire $11.00 went down the tubes.  What a waste!!!
This product was so disappointing that I discarded the entire box after trying one bar.  There are much better raw food bars on the market in terms of both nutrition and taste
This popcorn is rather bland. I purchased it because generally I like Newman's own brand and I liked the idea of Organic popcorn but it is flavorless. I would not buy again. 
I bought both the Ahi Tuna Jerky and Salmon Jerky. Both were dried out and brittle. Absolutely the worst.Incredibly, the Salmon Jerky was worse (i.e., drier, harder) than the Ahi Tuna Jerky
Although this is a good coffee, I was expecting something that tasted like a cappuccino.  This coffee tastes nothing like it, it doesn't even have a hint of cinnimon flavor as the package suggests.  If you want regular coffee, then this is the coffee to buy, but if you're looking for cappuccino, save your money
These cookies were ok, just ok.  I may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies, every last cookies was broken.  I understand this is probably due to poor packaging.  The consistency was a bit grainy and dry though.  And milk did not help.  Next time I'll purchase a chewy brand or Mrs. Fields
This coffee doesn't have anything special about it. I like good Kona coffee and I think 2 stars really tells it all
I was very disappointed in this product. I wanted to use them for snacks and pie crusts, but they are too stale to use. They are NOT crunchy as advertised since moisture has definitely entered through the packaging. Unfortunately Amazon will not let me return them, so I'm out $20. I was going to try some other products by this brand, but now I will not
Date on bottom of can shows an expiration of June 2007. I would expect a longer shelf life.Also the label shows mechanically extracted chicken meat. This generally equates to bone fragments. I'm not confident with this product
i have been buying Stoneridge Orchards products for a long time, so i decided to try the variety pack for quick snacks. not only the product seems inferior to their regular packages, but also, the pouches were half open in the box. what a rip of
Okay, yes, I know the brand is Dr. Kracker and maybe that should have been a clue as to the texture of this product.  However, I have had flatbreads made by other companies that were actually the texture of a pita.  These are VERY crunchy and don't have a whole lot of flavor.  Additionally, they were shipped and arrived expired.  If you are shopping for a super-healthy cracker, this may be it.  If you are looking for a whole grain flatbread with the texture of a pita, keep shopping - this is not it.  My next venture for this product is to grind it up and use as bread crumbs on top of broiled tilapia
This product is way too salty.  I didn't like it at all, and neither did any of my family.  you can't get the taste out your mouth either after tasting one.
The product has way too much liquid.  Good for in a pinch
I beat this mix longer than the 10 minutes suggested, and it was still too runny to even stay in my angelfood cake pan.  It baked flat & a disgusting rubbery texture, and was completely inedible.  When I very nicely wrote about my concerns and to request a product refund, the Customer Service person said they could not give me a refund, and said "thank you for your understanding" -- huh??  I'll never purchase any more of their products
This tastes nothing like buttered corn on the cob. In fact it tastes exactly like regular salted white popcorn with no butter. On the positive side it's not greasy... but don't expect anything exciting from the taste
I tossed it out. The texture is aweful and brittle. Only a few pieces were over 2 inches long and there was some sand like grit making it completely unedible. GROSS! you get what you pay for.
Hello,I have not received this item. Please send me the delivery receipt details
Terribly waxy chocolate pieces that all sunk to the bottom of the bowl while the flakes floated on top.  The flakes seem to have a chocolate flavoring added to enhance the experience but those disgusting chocolate pieces made me gag and I wondered what I was eating...!  Alone they were nearly tasteless and I'll never purchase again.  Yuck
There are bugs in the tea bags. Now, these aren't the 'organic' bugs you find in your garden when you plant veggies. These are the bugs that dig into expired produce. There are about 4-5 bugs in each bag. If you want some protein boost while relaxing before you go to bed, this is the product to buy. Also, the tea bags aren't made from organdy. It's some sort of plastic/polyester. I burnt a bag and it melted, turned black, and glued onto itself. Horrible, unethical company
Skippy pulls the worst kind of nonsense with this product - claiming it's all natural, which is technically true, but also implying that since it's natural, it's healthy, which is false for this product sice they ruined it.  Real peanut butter contains one ingredient: peanuts, and maybe a dash of salt.  Nothing else.  Real peanut butter is very good for you.  Skippy adds palm oil, a tropical oil which, while it's slightlybetter than soem other tropical oils, still contains saturated fats and is completely unnecessary, to this "spread".  Why?  So the poor widdle you doesn't have to spend a whole four seconds stirring it.  Of course, this would all be a lot more clear if amazon actually had the nutrtion labels available, but they don't - nor do they carry ANY kind of actual all-natural peanut butter.Skip this, skip all the so-called "peanut butters" carreied here, and go to yoru local store to get soem real natural peanut butter.  Look at the label - if it has any other ingredient than peanuts and salt, put it back on the shelf.  Nothing else is necessary
Although the product claims to be a viable additive for shakes/drinks, our experience is it won't dissolve without a blender.  Simply put it clumps.The taste is fine, actually good, so my recommendation is to look elsewhere for a drink supplement
As another viewer pointed out this product contains CORN SYRUP not at all organic. In fact the only organic thing in this product is the Fig. For those of us trying to maintain a healthy organic eating lifestyle you MUST read the list of ingredients before assuming the front label is accurate. This goes for all products not at all an attack against Paul Newman products which my family does consume we enjoy their products that are truly organic
I normally buy Special K cereal.  I found these boxes to be stale
I thought these would be slightly sour, like dried cherries I have enjoyed in the past. No--HFCS is High Fructose Corn Syrup--so these taste strangely sweet, like weird raisins. They are OK if I cook them in oatmeal or if I'm really hungry, but I wouldn't buy them again. If you are looking for tart dried cherries look elsewhere
It arrived rancid with mold in all 4 jars ... not so great. I have purchased there other products and enjoyed but not this. Pretty Gross overall.
Sorry guys, I don't know if I wasn't tasting REAL Miso Soup at my local restaurant, but the thing is I didn't like this one bit, and I still have lots of packages left! haha.. I gave it a chance because I love the soup from the Japanese restaurant I visited and I wanted to taste this soup whenever I wanted, at home. But, I didn't like the flavor, don't know if I'm missing something, but better buy one (ONE) a see for yourself
Edited Review:  My first order came with leaking jars.  Amazon replaced and the second order arrived in good condition.  The one star, which I can't seem to change, reflected that fact.  My updated review is three stars.I was mildy disappointed in this topping.  Out of the jar, the black olives and the artichokes provide a flavor that has definate sour notes.  The texture of the ingrediants was pasty (as opposed to chunky).  I would have given this only two stars if this was supposed to be a pasta sauce.  However, I followed the directions on the jar to create their version of Bruschetta.  It is acceptable.  Since this is billed as a "topping" I am willing to give it three stars since in that capacity to performs at a pleasurable level.The Vodka sauce is much more to my liking.       
These were a sticky mess in the bag - the fruit juice leaked from the lollypops and leaked out of the plastic wrap.  They were also soft and seemed stale.  Great ingredients, but the final product was disappointing
I bought a CASE, they expire in one month. They taste great, But SHAME on AMAZON. I also bough Butter Rounds, they expired LAST YEAR
I ordered both this and Honey Nut version.  I wish I had paid more attention to the Low Fat part of this version.  This version is hard and too cinnamon/sugary which seems to happen w/ some low-fat cereals.  They compensate for the low fat by sugaring it up and end up w/ a hard less tasty and less filling product.  However, the Honey Nut version is very good.  It has good crunch, but is not too hard and has tasty almond slivers in it.  It's sweet, but not overly for granola, and no cinnamon taste at all.  I understand many products w/ raisins add cinnamon and I typically like cinnamon, but this version is too much and the raisins too dried out and hard.  The package is very convenient though.I now have to mix in the regular version w/ this product to help me get rid of the Low Fat stuff.Some label info:  Low Fat w/ Raisin (LF) has 180 calories per 1/2 cup while Honey Nut (HN) has only 20 more at 200.  There are 12 1/2 cup servings in the HN while the LF only has 10.  Product weight is HN 24 oz and LF 20.5 oz.  Finally sugars are HN 11g while the LF has 15g
These apples are coated in sugar and other gunk (like sunflower oil) which gives them a strange taste. I was very disappointed when I tried them. I was wanting nice dried apples that taste like apples instead of oil, sugar and preservatives. Now I'm stuck with two bags of a product that is not very good. I also got stuck with the dried strawberries which are even worse. I will not be trying any more Stoneridge Orchard products. BE AWARE!!, these products cannot be returned to Amazon so be sure before you order
I was disappointed with this product. I love dried fruit but this product is overly sweet and does not have much strawberry taste. They have a strange smell but not a nice strawberry smell. They are very dark in color and moist from sunflower oil. Simple dried fruit without the oil and fructose additions would be much nicer. You should also know that this food product cannot be returned. I would have sent it back in a flash if I could have
Do not be fooled by this sugar coated seemingly delectable pastry!  I have been a long time fan of the original Pop-Tart and the Go-Tart just seemed like the natural progression of things, so I went along with the newest technology in mass produced baked goods.  The Go-Tart offers you a Pop-Tart on the go, because everyone knows this is the 21st century and we are on the move.  I'm venturing to guess that Go-gurt was a success so why not make a Go-Tart?  Well, there are a number of reasons.  Actually just one.  You can already eat a Pop Tart on the go.It's too bad the Go-Tart ruined everything I loved about the Pop-Tart.  The greatest hope I had for this flop of a product was that the frosting (or what you'd like to call that sugary stuff on the top) would reach the corners of the tart, unlike the original Pop-Tart.  Though the sugar covers the corners, there is barely any frosting at all on this tart!  It is but a thin line of the sugary goodness we would all expect from a normal Pop-Tart.  The filling has a gooey consistency, and worst of all, the breading part crumbled in my hand.  I had to eat my Go-Tart in pieces.  This is clearly not on the go.  This is worse than a Pop-tart, and is probably more fattening than one.  Save your money, boycott the Go-Tart
This bar would be great if it wasn't so full of sugar. It gives me a sugar headache.
very sad to say that this is salty, no I mean SALTY! Will try something else for my son. Annie, please make these less salty and I will try them again
Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months.  They are heat sensitive. As the packaging states "IMPORTANT- STORE IN COOL DRY AREA". The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together.  They probably cooked during shipping and are not a "Raw Food" and not as "Nutritious" anymore.  Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened.   Amazon.com does not accept grocery returns.  It was a waste of $40.
The pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell -- what are these "packaging engineers" thinking? It took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it, and then I took the scissors to it, and the hard packaging almost broke them!But I was thrilled.  A handsome object, thought I, and I loved the clip in the back that you pinch to open.  So much better than having to wrestle it down over a soft waistband.  I yanked out the plastic battery protector and set to work to rev the thing up to speed.  But, alas, it would not follow instructions as they were written.  "Press and hold the Set button.  Hour display blinking."  (Could they not have said, "The hour display will blink"?  I pressed.  "Press Memory button to adjust the hour."  I did.  The Memory button never did a thing.  So I asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either.  We both tried several combinations of maneuvers, but nothing worked.  To this moment, the hour display is blinking, blinking, blinking.I'd like to get my money back, but ya know what?  J & R Music & Computer World in NY demand such a rigamarole to send it back, including with all the original packaging (I threw the OP in the trash), that you almost have to be a genius in packaging to follow their instructions, which, of course, are not designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves.  Now I'm afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the trash, while I will make sure I never order from J&R again.    
Be sure to measure your arm before purchasing... it's annoying to receive the unit with the Standard Adult Arm Cuff (fits arms 9 to 13 inches around) and find out I have to order a larger arm cuff!Don't bother calling Omron "Customer Service" at 1-800-634-4350... just a typical big company voice mail hell! It even tells you to call another number to order the piece...My 1 Star rating is only for the ordering information not provided and Omrons "customer service
The reading magnifiers I ordered 09/29/04 finally arrived 10/19/04 after a call to the seller. (Original order was shipped to Amazon.com so it had to be reshipped to me.) It only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading magnifiers, and it is possible to adjust it to just about any position with the clever arm.  The weighted base does keep it from falling over. Unfortunately, the thin plastic lense is such poor quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the device.  If the user turned the adjustment knob too far, it and the nut that holds it together would fall off.  The nut is small and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to assemble the device.  The knob actually turns the nut onto the screw. Presumably the device is for someone with low vision.  If the small nut falls to the floor, I'm not sure someone with low vision would be able to find it.  My advice is to save your money and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens.... and if possible, try the device out before buying.
The foil is a bit misleading, because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves (under the zipper) the timmer will catch you and it hurts, a lot. The foil can ONLY be used on straight surfaces. The two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle. If you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer.... well, be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa
like many other negative reviews, i've experienced the same problems with this razor.  i guess less blades is more and i'm going back to the m3 power.i'll be brief about the problems:1.  there's more "pulling" when you shave.  it felt like the hair on my face was being pulled out than cut.2.  the razor is harder to clean off.3.  i would get slight razor burn and i never get razor burn.4.  it's more expensive than other better razors out there.so there you have it.  if you HAVE to try it out, hey it might work for you.  but please, keep your receipt (and packaging) in case you want to get a refund.**  if you're reading this is 2009, chances are that gillette's money back guarantee will no longer be around.  however, there will probably be a gillette razor with 12 blades by then
What a disappointment!  The device just wasn't predictable.  Sometimes it would do as expected, sometimes not.  It was just a crapshoot.  Finally unplugged it and it's in a drawer somewhere.  Yes, I played with the sensitivity with no success.  Getting up to turn lights on and off was far less effort and aggravation than trying to convince The Clapper to do its thing.  Save your money and look elsewhere
I had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews. I used the razor as directed in the instruction manual. The manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use. I used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse. I had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal. Do not buy this product
I've got this meter a month ago. I intended to use it to measure my pulse during exercise, but I've never been able to do so! At rest, the meter gives a reading after several attempts, but often inaccurate. You have to stay still as a statue for 10-20 seconds to get a reading. Now I'm using it as an exercise watch/stopwatch
This pedometer is so much cheaper (~$7) than the typical decent ones (that go for about $18 - $20).. now I know it is for a reason.. the buttons are flimsy, the package looks very cheap, the one I bought and presented to a senior citizen - did not work, also found that the Sr Citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device.. terrible ergonomics/form factor.Would recommend spending a bit more and getting the Omron/Oregon Sc  $18 pedometers - much better form factor, high reliability and quality
It never ceases to amaze me how often Gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it's loyal clientele. The Fusion is a classic example, from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a Sensor Excel.Don't buy into the hype, the Fusion is an expensive joke of a product.
Pedometer part is fine.  Radio part is useless
The item pictured here is not what you will receive. You will receive a different model that has a different external and possibly internal design. Most important is that the model you get will NOT have the little orange change filter indicator. This very important feature takes the guess-work out of when to change the filter. Don't buy this item from this seller if you expect to get what is pictured. Thanks, pj-berk
I bought this item and returned it after it stopped working after two days. The massages were not that strong and I feel it was not a good buy even though the price at Amazon was way lower than most places. I have since bought another product and it is much nicer
I hate this product. I receive it as a gift, and all the products are not adapted for babies, plus, looks very cheap!
It warms ok, not great. But the worst thing is, the massage is LOUD! I work at home, in my basement, where it gets cold, and was thrilled to get this to keep my feet warm, and was excited to get massage too. However, I can't use the massage feature while I am on the phone - it is way too loud. And there is no control on the heating element, just on and off. A disappointment. I still use the heat feature, but also wear thick socks
This is not one of the best hair dryers I've had.  At best, it's average.  The nozzle is too long, and the concentrator attachment is fixed at horizontal.  I like attachments that can rotate so that I can change the angle to reach different parts of my hair.  The ionic feature makes no difference to the length of drying time or texture of my hair.  After using this hair dryer for 1 yr and 3 mths (about 3X a week), the switch for heat settings is now loose.  The dryer only blows cool air even though I slide the switch for higher temperatures.  My rating has gone from average to below average
When the internal rechargable battery dies so does the unit.The power cord will not power the shaver once the battery can no longer hold a charge.   You cannot replace the regargable battery yourself!Sending the unit for factory repair after its warranty will cost you more than buying a new one.As for the shave: not bad, but not exceptional either.The cutters a very tiny, not built to last, and are not durable.All rechargable batteries have a limited life depening on conditions on how they are used.This shaver may last you a few months - a year, 2 to 3 years will be a stretch.  I also have a braun and a norelco, the norelco is 10years old and running fine, the braun is 15 years - both have original cutters and foil - I heavy duty clean them in 97% alchohol about once a year, and brush out debris about once every 7 uses, these units dont have batteries and this is why I purchased the remington to have acess when there is no power plug available.The Remington shaver really needs to have it's cutter blades cleaned (brushed off or washed) after every use (what a Pain)!I find this shaver to be a waste of money as it is more akin to being a disposable electric shaver - than one that will last
The seams on the pillow are sharp and uncomfortable.  The extra pouches that supposedly provide additional support don't measure up.  THe snaps that should hold the ends together don't work.  Basically, it would be OK if it came with a soft cover
I am in my early 30's and never had a problem with acne until my mid 20's.  I had been using proactiv for quite some time (5 years or so) and it worked pretty well.  I say pretty well since it did clear my face some, but my face has not been totally clear in a long time.Along comes AcneFree which is "better" than Proactiv since you can buy it locally and it contains more of the active ingredient--cool, I am sick of ordering it online and it is cheaper!Well, I guess you get what you pay for--I don't consider myself to have particularly sensitive skin, but I used AcneFree one time in the morning.  So far so good--until 2 am the next morning when I broke out in hives all over my entire body.  So no more AcneFree for me, just wanted to give my experience for anyone who might be in the same situation
This is the first time in my life I have been inspired to come online and write a review of a product.When I first saw the ad for this on TV, I thought it sounded like just what I needed.  I rushed to the store, but it wasn't even on sale yet.  Finally I found it yesterday at walgreen's- and I hate to say- it stinks!I have just below shoulder length curly hair.  I generally throw in some gel and let it air dry- I hate spending a lot of time on my hair.  But once in a while I straighten it- which involves blow dry with a round brush, and then using a ceramic flatiron to finish.  I am not very good with a hair dryer, and it takes me a long time and I find it awkward managing the brush and the dryer, and I don't do a very good job.  Plus then I need to use the iron too, and it takes me a good 30-45 min total.So I thought this product would be great.  All in one! A time-saver! Easier to use!Well, I was wrong.First of all, it took about twice as long just to dry my hair as it would with my hairdryer.  It's not very powerful.  Next, it was barely straight!  Even on the "4" setting, there wasn't much tension at all.  It left my hair puffy and frizzy and barely straight.  So after an hour, I had hair that was not as straight as if I had just dried it alone- and I still needed to use the flatiron.Don't be fooled.  It will NOT give you the flat sleek hair that they picture on the box.I just hope I can return it.Guess I will stick with my CHI iron for now.I *might* try the "long hair" version of this dryer to see if that's any better
This brush is worth about 10 bucks. Anything more and you are throwing money down the drain.
This glove will simply temporarily mask some of the symtoms associated with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and repetitive strain injuries and make problems worse. Since one still has full function of his/her hands when using this, you are further injuring your hands by using the flexor muscles in grabing and squeezing. When using these gloves, your hands and wrist will feel better at first, but once the glove is removed your problems will persist and get progressively worse
The light was very good, the magnifier (very tiny) made of plastic which was optically difficult to look thru if you already wear glasses.  But the worst part were the tweezers in themselves.  They were difficult to squeeze togeter because of their placement on the handle.  Also, I am used to sharp tweezers that come together tightly over the hair.  These did not.  So they do not tweeze well at all.  Wasn't worth all the bother of a return.  I just threw it away.  It was a good idea for a product, just poorly made. 
This shaver is ok but has an electronic problem. I get clean shave with little bit of effort but, My main problem is with ON/OFF button. Just after using this for 3-4 months my shaver ON/OFF button stopped working.  It is always in ON position I can't switch off the razor. The only way it switches off is when the battery runs out
I'd give it 0 starts if that was an option! A total piece of crap! Try cleaning it, and the head falls apart! Try putting it back together, and plan on doing nothing else for a LONG TIME! DO NOT buy this razor
This will require a large mitten in colder weather.  This does not appear to use electrical impulse.This will require more adapting to than you might think.When working, it is accurate.
I had boughten this as a gift which turned out to be an aweful idea. It is way too loud and the force of air is way too strong. It literally causes loss of hearing and causes your hair to look like you were just caught in a tornado. I do not recommend this hair dryer for anyone.
This remington razor is actually too sharp if you ask me.  I used it for a period of several weeks and it caused my face to blister and it actually gave me more cuts than a 10 cent disposable razor. Ouch. However, the shave is very close - expect to use a lot of cooling lotion with this razor.  The design of the shaver mechanically is fine and appears to be fairly reliable - although its a touch hard to clean because the blades are super sharp underneath the foils. I have owned Norelco and Braun for more than 15 years and on the whole found them to be a more agreeable shave
I purchased the Kaz Ultra King Size Heating Pad off eBay to replace another Kaz heating pad that stopped working after 2-3 months.  Well, this is no different except I now have more expensive heating pad that is useless.  Just like the other reviewers, my controller suddenly started blinking red and would not allow me to press any other button to start the heat process.  I plugged and unplugged the unit several times with several long time increments each time.  I also tried holding down all of the hear setting buttons for several seconds, sometimes two or three at once.  Nothing worked.  Its was nice while it lasted-- heated well without getting too hot.  It is just a shame that the quality could not last for more than two months.  Thumbs down!DO NOT PURCHASE A KAZ SOFTHEAT HEATING PAD IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEY.
I won't be buying these, because there is not enough public comments or even actual photos of people using these goggles. If you look closely on the example photos provided by amazon the people that supposingly wear these things, then you'll notice they aren't really wearing them its just drawn
They claim that it helps you fall asleep and keeps you asleep. I did fall asleep sooner, but wasn't able to stay asleep. I didn't find it to workwell at all.
Upon purchasing this product, I'd hoped it would be equivilant to the product I normally purchase at the salon.  I was horribly disappointed.  It was nothing at all like the typical product, rather much more like water.  The normal scent was not present, the product made my hair greasy and my head itched all day long.  I would very much like to return this.  It's not at all the same product that is purchased at the salon.  I was sorely disappointed
I was overwhelmed by the choices, and selected this model, in part, because of the reasonal price.  I had read reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the product, but I decided there was only a small possibility of that happening.  The instructions said to use the lowest setting initially, which certainly made sense.  However, the INSTRUCTIONS said to move the adjustment "toward the tip", which turned out to be the highest, not the lowest setting!  The diagram on the handle indicated that the movement was toward the LARGER opening, but I read the directions and did not look at the diagram until later.  The spray was very powerful and actually "hurt", especially when it was by my tooth with a crown.  The next day I tried adjusting the settings with the pik over my sink, not in my mouth!  It felt wonderful on the lower setting!  I reread the directions again (and again over the next several days) to see if the error was mine or theirs.  I still think the directions were not written properly.  The third day I had trouble getting any spray at all.  This continued for about a week, some days getting more or less, but never a full spray ON ANY SETTING!  My guess is that it was in a permanent "pause" mode. I gave up and pursued returning the item.  It needed to be returned to an "authorized repair", which luckily was only a few miles away (there were only three in my state).  The repair man had told me, over the phone, it was a discontinued model and hadn't been made in about  a year.  When he looked at it, he found it had been made in 2006.  He said he could fix it, but wasn't allowed to; I am awaiting a replacement to arrive in the mail. 
my door handle was to the left and therefore could not use although product said that this lever could be used on all lever handles--shipping costs were more than item purchased so it would cost me way too much to try to retur
After a very positive review by a popular consumer magazine, I purchased this scale. On the unit I received, the upper weight range appears to be overstated by some 20 lbs. The scale I was previously using and the one in my doctors office clearly have my weight below the 300 lb limit. I have been lifting weights and somewhat discouraged by the scale alone. I wanted to see if I was having an impact on body fat so I purchased this scale. When I attempt to use this scale, it errors out with the OL code. Perhaps the magazine should retract another article
I went through 3 of these in less than 2 months.  After about 2-3 weeks of use, the first two dryers wouldn't shut off when the switch was placed in the "off" position; the dryers had to be unplugged to turn them off.  The 3rd dryer just stopped working completely after about 2 weeks.  I definitely do not recommend buying this product
I bought this product after having taken Diet Fuel w/ ephedra several years ago. I needed energy this time and to lose a few extra baby pounds.  Within minutes of taking my FIRST and ONLY pill I had a horrible reaction.  I broke out in WELTS within 10 minutes all over my body. I was shaky and sick to my stomach.  I drank 5 glasses of milk to neutralize it and finally started to feel better. I thought I was going to die.  My only thought was there was no way losing weight was worth never seeing my kids again. After about 2 hours the welts disappeared but I felt horrible for the rest of the day.  Obviously there is something in it that doesn't get along with my body but after that reaction I had I have decided that no diet pill is worth the chance of what can happen to you.  
Although I am definitely on the 'Sonicare' bandwagon in so far as this product's ability to clean my teeth--it does a great job--this model brush is made quite poorly. The battery compartment (the e3000 uses 'AA' batteries) on mine, regardless of it having an o-ring on the door, seems to be continually wet inside, with the negative (-) terminal on one of the AA-cells rusting after only two weeks use. Philips acknowledges this is a problem but offers no solution.Also, there are many small crevices in/around the nameplate on the side, and a large gap under the nut for the brush-head that accumulates 'gook' on a daily basis. Philips advises that this is probably 'mold' and the brush should be 'disassembled and air-dried' after every use. It takes longer to do this than to brush my teeth--Again, while this is probably one of the best ways to clean your teeth at this point in time, and an economical way to try one of the products that normally start out at $64e (and up), there is no reason why the e3000 shouldn't be made as well as the better units, or hold up to water/daily use as well as some of the $9 Crest electrics we commonly see
The adjustable slider combs are horrible and I found the Conair where you had several combs to choose from worked better for me.  I cannot get it to cut the hair on my husband who likes it very short, it would not even take any hair off.  All it did was waste money and electricity to charge the battery.  I thought this was the best brand out there, but Conair beats them by a mile. I think I will take it back and get a refund and go buy a Conair with the money. 
I bought two boxes of these Luv diapers (thats 448 diapers!) and I sure wish I had spent a little extra for Pampers Swaddlers.  These diapers leak out the top because they don't have any elastic on the tabs or anywhere on the waist.  Even the generic Kroger diapers have elastic waistbands!  I am just sad that I have to use these crappy diapers for so long! I also think they run small so I probably will not even use them all. What a waste!  The only good thing about these diapers is the price, but, I would highly recommend that you just buy your store brand instead if money is an issue.  P.S. I don't like Huggies either because they leak out the legs! Hard to find a good diaper
I was happy to see this type of product available, but was not happy when I received it.  It seems like a flimsy piece of plastic, and the "magnets" looked like they were painted on, a gold-tone, and the paint looked like it was chipping off.  The base of the item is separate from the top of the item, which seems to be attached with springs?  It did run, but was very loud, like it was working too hard.  There is a note not to use it more than 20 minutes, which I'm not sure is because of a potential adverse affect with the user, or because the unit might overheat.  There were some spelling errors on the outside of the box (a few places said "reflexology" and a few places said "relexology")-- but maybe that just bothers me?  I think it is also important to note that the buyer pays shipping, and if returned -- also pays RETURN shipping charges; and when combined, nearly equals the original cost of the item.  ;o(
I couldn't send this item back quickly enough.  I presumed by its price being 2 to 3 times that of other foot massagers, that it would be an effective, high quality item. NEVER PRESUME!  With a low powered hair dryer mounted in the middle, it sounds like a small aircract while the base vibrates uncontrolably.  I'd say about twice as much energy was disbursed out the feet of the unit to my hardwood floor than to my feet.  I'm not someone with unreasonable expectactions as many of the reviewers I've read seem to have.  This is just an unusable product.  The materials look cheaper in person, it offers virtually no "massage" to the foot, and it is incredibly loud.  There is no redeeming quality to this item.  Before I bought it, I looked all over the web for a review, unable to find one.  Hopefully I can save someone else the disappointment.  Did I mention I hated it
Worst product on the market! A huge disappointment. I was very careful to use as directed. The result? One big mess! The lens were smeared and foggy with bubbles in them and I had no choice but to throw them away
Had to return this b/p cuff. Could not get it to work properly. Medical devices need to be made a great deal better than this one..
Unless you have the physique of an NBA player find another make of massager.  This one is too heavy, hard or impossible to hold, and very awkward to use.  If used by one person on another it might be usable.  On the positive side it does give you a good massage
I really wanted to love this fragrance...after all, it is quite expensive and I'd read rave reviews on many websites...but after one spritz I sold it to a friend of mine! My favorite perfumes are Beyond Paradise, Ralph Lauren Romance, Ralph Lauren Style, and DKNY Be Delicious. Light Blue, to me, smells overwhelmingly of musk. I wore it all day and I ended up feeling nauseous, with a bad headache. This must be one of those perfumes that works well on most everyone else except for me
This may work well, but the cuff size is not as it is in the description. It says this will work on an arm circumference of up to 18 inches. Not even close. My arm is a little under 13 inches and was too large for the cuff by far. Sure, you can get the cuff to go around your arm, but there are indications on the cuff that have to line up for it to work properly, and there was just no way to even come close
I have had this straightener for about a year.  It will get my wavy hair straight but not quickly and I have to use the high heat settings.  Also, my hair does not get stick straight but if your hair is already pretty straight then this is a good straightener
Made of cheap plastic. Generate loud noise. The switch broke off the 2nd week I got it.
Because if you do, this is the unit to do it with! The combination of a demineraliztion cartridge that does not work and/or the silver stick has resulted in the total coating of my new macbook pro's internal circuitry with metal deposits. No, I do not work in a metal shop. I use my computer solely in my apartment room. Yes, it is from the humidifer. The dispersion pattern is heaviest around the fan intake areas.
Would work great, except...this doesn't fit my new WaterPik Ultra (WP-100). 
I agree with the other reviews. It was a huge disappointment that it didn't heat the water. It is only supposed to maintain the temperature, but after using it for about 20 minutes, it didn't even do that. The manual rollers hurt my feet and it sloshes water around and spills it when you move your feet back and forth. Back to the store indeed
This dryer made my wavy hair straighter than a seperate brush and dryer ever could.  THe problem is that it just shuts off.  The first time I used it, it shut off twice within a 20-minute period.  It wouldn't restart when I plugged it back in, or even when I tried a different outlet.  No matter what I tried, it wouldn't restart for about 5 minutes.  I've used an older model of this dryer and the same thing happened.  I wouldn't recommend buying this product
I saw a commercial, I read a reviews - and so I bough one box at Walmart. It's not worth it, that's my conclusion. The trays are made of very thin plastic-like material, and are very difficult to position properly on your teeth. The active gel easy goes out of trays, and fills your mouth. During first couple od uses, after 20 min or so I started to feel a vague pain in my gum.  Nevertheless, I continued using the product for all 7 days, as advertised, 30 min a day. After the whole package was gone, the change of color of my teeth is barely visible. I hope you will have better luck.  
I am suppose to be receiving a refund  because I have done sent it back but I have not heard anything from ya'll
The batteries that come with this charger we're not a problem for me.  In fact, I was surprised that they were fully charged right out of the package and seem to work fine.  I was however, disappointed in the charger.  The charger requires that all four AA batteries be in the charger for it to work.  You cannot charge just one, two or three batteries because the circuit is not complete without all four batteries inserted. Also, there are a maximum of two slots for AAA batteries and when they are in use none of the other AA slots are usable.  Given the price of NiMH batteries, the charger works out to be about $2... which is about what it's worth at best.
I read the directions and followed them to a T. The pain was just too intense (on my gums - they started to bleed!). I tried to adjust the "trays" every which way, but there was no way not to get the gel on my gums. After all the time, trouble and pain, I didn't see ANY improvement in whiteness. I have used the older Crest Whitestrips, and liked them much better.
Last month,Feb.10, I ordered one box this wipes. But when I opened it today, all bag showed the exp.12/31/2006. I am wondering how to contact them
Well I have used Philips LadyShave before,and I regret for making my mind to try this one...It hardly does shave any hair of my legs and leaves a lot of painful red scars
Both my wife and I have high blood pressure, which our doctor would like us to track at home. After checking out many brands and styles of automatic monitors, and based on the reviews here, I didn't hesitate to buy the Mark of Fitness, Inc monitor (Prevention edition).  When I received it, there were two problems: First, there was no owner's manual inside. Since I kept getting an "err 2" message, I had no way of checking what that meant. (Amazon.com suggested I look online for a pdf version somewhere. Unfortunately, the Mark of Fitness' web site didn't have online manuals.)  The second and more important problem with this product was that it was clearly very inaccurate.  When I finally was able to get some readings, they were: 112/64, 106/60, 96/61, 106/62, 109/64, and 115/62.  Oh, how I wish some of those WERE my readings!  Maybe it was just my misfortune to get that one in 500 lemons with no owner's manual and who knows what else wrong with it, but unfortunately, I won't take a chance on trying another one.  It's going back today
These did NOT suppress my appetite, though many days I took 3 tablets three times a day!  Had very good luck with a bottle of Dytrexil (also a Hoodia product), but the next bottle of THAT, nothing.  I guess like crops, you can get good batches and bad batches.  These struck me as a bad batch.  As one reviewer said, I actually felt HUNGRIER many days.  Egad!  Better luck next time!  Sigh
The mirror's light is quite dim and the magnification (5x)is inadequate for most purposes
i order it on july 14th, but i still have to wait for more than a month to get it.
I have not recieved the vitamins!!!!!!!!!  Lost in the mail??????   Please let me know what I can do, it has been a month
This product is a piece of garbage.When it works, it does what it is suppose to do. However, it worked for the first two weeks and then totally died on me.Do not buy this product
Bayer is a name-brand aspirin.  Any brand-name drug will cost at least double of that of the equivalent generic aspirin.  I give this a one-star rating not because it is a poor product, rather, because it is so expensive. The dosage is 81 mg, taken to thin the blood to prevent heart attacks and strokes (generally taken by older individuals who perhaps have arteriosclerosis, have had a heart attack or stroke).  Aspirin is a wonder-drug, the very first analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to hit the market over 100 years ago. It is for mild to moderate pain and treats many different conditions such as arthritis, bone inflammation, joint pain, and even reduces fever. Aspirin causes blood platelets to not adhere to each other, thus it "thins" the blood and prevents blood clots from forming. Aspirin is thus used in emergency treatment of heart attacks and strokes. Some folks take a "baby" aspirin (81-160 mgs) each day to prevent blood clots from forming. Aspirin is actually acetyl-salicylic acid. Manufacturers alter the structure of aspirin slightly to grant it different properties in terms of its digestion, to make digestion easier. Some buffer it with antacids while others coat the tablet with a coating that prevents its digestion in the stomach (like Ecotrin). Regular aspirin, without any buffering or coatings is tolerated by most people, but some cannot take it without severe stomach upset. For these folks, the buffered form is a god-send. Unfortunately, Aspirin fell out of favor in the 60's and 70's when Reye's Syndrome developed in some children (under the age of 16) who took aspirin while they had the flu and/or chickenpox. About 30% of the children affected died and many more had permanent brain damage. Because of Reye's Syndrome, alternate analgesics were placed on the market, the premier being Tylenol. There is no reason to fear using aspirin if you are an adult, as Reye's Syndrome only occurred in children under 16 years of age. The usual dose of aspirin is 350 mg, with the "extra-strength form at 500 mg. Most adults will easily tolerate a dose of 650 mg (2 tablets) every 4 hours with a maximum daily dose of 5,200 mg. (Some with rheumatoid arthritis take up to 7200 mg/day with a doctor's supervision). There is no additional benefit to taking more than 1,000 mg every 4 hours. Increasing the dose beyond this point will only increase the toxicity of aspirin. Aspirin should be avoided in people taking blood-thinning medications, those with stomach ulcers, and used with caution in insulin-dependent diabetics. Allergies can develop to aspirin as well. Never mix aspirin with any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, such as Ibuprofen, as there is no pain benefit and the gastric upset chance is greatly increased. Don't mix aspirin with alcohol either, as it is hard on the stomach. Used properly, aspirin is a terrific medication. I prefer to buy my aspirin in a generic form. One pays more for aspirin if it is produced by a name-brand manufacturer. However, the big-manufacturers also package aspirin in some of the buffered forms that some people tolerate better.

I don't know, but.. I couldn't get myself to swallow it. It made me, literally, vomit. I wish I just ordered Power Bar's Vanilla-Yoghurt flavored one, which tastes fantastic and I love so very much.Anyway, probably it's just me but, it really really makes me sick.. I thought I would taste something new but oh well..
This mirror is unsatisfactory becasue the light is negligible and the magnification (5x) is not sufficient
This product is called a "Bouffant Style Oversized" shower cap.It is so small that it would not fit over my wife's head.The product features list claims it is made of "soft, pretty fabric."In fact it is made of thin, crunchy plastic.It is so poorly made that the stiching is crooked, overlaps and has threads hanging in several places.This shower cap went directly in the garbage
The "original" Glide was made by (or used) Gore Tex material. The photo for this product showed the logo for Gore Tex. The product shipped was the product now marketed by Crest; no mention of Gore Tex. The Crest product is vastly inferior to the "original" Gore Tex
The size is good but the second one we ordered leaked. The cap did not fit... The after taste is not so strong but very difficult to see the difference from an ordinary stainless steel container/warmer which costs only $6-$10 dollars in the market around. Too pricy and the thin plastic cap does not match well with the product
WARNING:  THIS SYSTEM COULD BE HARMFUL TO YOUR HEALTH AND HAPPINESS and walls.1.)  The danged clippy thingy is very difficult to snap on to the HOT, damp, roller, so it is very easy to burn fingers while trying to manipulate it. 2.) This is very frustrating, and made this reviewer want to throw roller and clippy thingy at the wall.3.) The Sadistic designer only made ONE WAY for the You-can't-put-a-square-peg-in-a-round-hole variously sized rollers to be replaced in the unit after use.  This puzzle remains unsolved by this reviewer. 4.) This is very frustrating, and made this reviewer want to throw the whole danged unit, rollers and clippy thingies included, at the wall.5.) Even if you only use a few of the rollers on your hair, you have to take them ALL OUT of the unit - (the better to play the afore-mentioned puzzle game, my dear) to dump the unused water out of the unit prior to storage.6.) This is very frustrating, and made this reviewer want to throw the whole danged water-filled unit, rollers and clippy thingies included, at the wall./TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer
This item was recommended in a magazine article for calluses on your feet, so I bought this specifically for that use. I used the triangular pumice attachment only.I was under the impression that the attachment would rotate,but in general it's just a vibrating(2 levels) machine with attachments that you move around your body manually. The vibrations weren't intense enough to make any difference. The actual machine has no function. The body resurfacing cream which has little scrubbing crystals was ok , but can easily be used without this machine
I searched around for a quite long time before I decide to purchase this model - the performance of this clipper is very poor, I have to switched back to my old kit to cut my son's hair.  Very dispointed
Don't buy this product. I went through two units with the same problem. The trimmer is made of cheap plastic with plastic tabs to snap onto to the blade. Within less than one week the tabs broke and the trimmer would no longer stay attached. Further the base/stand is just a lightweight piece of junk that does not properly hold the handle and accessories - very poorly designed, Wahl should be embararssed. It did a nice job of trimming my beard but the attachments are so awkward to install and remove, the base practically useless and the trimmer tabs break so easily that I would have given it no stars if possible. The fact that I returned one unit only to get a second that broke within a week makes me wonder what good the two year warranty is worth
Over time (9 months) my aquasana filter developed cracks in both the shower head and filter housing. Customer service told me to buy a new one. I guess it really is 'All about the money'. Pass this loser. Buy a metal body filter
It does let you shake and mix up the protein well. But no matter how tightly you screw the cap on liquid gets all around the edge and in the threads. Then as soon as you put it down it all runs down the sides and leaks everywhere. It's a horribly cheap and leaky design. I would look elsewhere or just be prepared with a lot of paper towels every time you use it. (and if you find a good one that doesn't leak please post the info here and let me know). Thanks
Worked well five times. Then it slowed down and made cutting more difficult despite removing head and running water through it to clean, as per instructions. Then it would run before cutting, but upon trying to edge trim my moustache, it would stop immediately, as if a single hair could jam it. Removing head, as required for cleaning, showed that bottom part with its drive motor worked fine, with a rotating metal stub that fit loosely into a poorly made plastic part that moved the blade. It appears that this plastic part's stability, shape and alignment changed after a few uses allowing hairs to jam its movement. A poor design that shouldn't have used plastic. Do not bu
I was pretty excited to try an ION hairdryer. I got this one because I liked the idea of being able to 'control' the amount of ions coming out. My hair DID seem a little shinier after using it (the only reason I gave it two stars and not one) but my hair felt a little drier. Almost straw-ish...it never felt like that with my old drier. Also the buttons really are hard to switch...all of them! I read another review that said that and I thought well how bad can it be? I dry my hair with a round brush in my right hand and the dryer in the left. I turn the dryer on and off during different times while I am doing my hair. With this dryer I could NOT turn the on/off switch with my left hand. I had to put down my brush and use both hands. I could not believe how hard it was to switch! This was the main deciding factor in returning the dryer, it was SO frustrating not to be able to switch it easily with a flick of your thumb. Not to mention made me feel like a big wussy!!!The speed setting only has two settings, low and high. The low setting was way too low and the high setting was way too high. A middle ground would have been nice. Lastly, the dryer smelled a little weird. Granted, I only had it two days before I returned it, so the smell might eventually disappear. But it wasn't your normal 'new hairdryer, hot plastic' smell. It was almost a slight mildew smell. Yuk.So, I would NOT recommend getting it. I exchanged it for the Vidal Sassoon ion sensor dryer. That seems to be working better. The low speed setting is perfect. The smell is normal 'new dryer' smell so far. The buttons are EASY to push!!!!  The sensor (it automatically turns off when you pur it down) is a little off, it takes a while to turn off. But all in all I like it. And it also DOES make my hair shiny and DOES NOT make it feel drier or like straw!
One I started using the shaver it fell apart.  It has plastic tabs to hold it together and they just don't work.  The shaver is a waste of money
I had a waterpik which started having problems after a year (planned obsolescence, LA water...Who knows). I bought this hoping for better longevity but it is disappointing. I like the layout of the reservoir and controls but it is not nearly as powerful as the water pick and the reservoir is way to small. Just my opinion (humble as it may be
This product does not work if you have soft blonde hair.  My hair is not coarse and this razor just glided right over top with out cutting a thing.  It's comfortable to hold and seems like it is made well, but it is definatly not for those of us with soft hair. 
The drywalls in my house apparently have some insulation blown into them, and I could not get the hooks to work.  I finally did get one  in place and hung a medium large picture on it, and it failed.  Far short of the maximum weight on the package.   In all fariness the walls were not the right kind of walls and I think whey would work fine for small and medium pics.  The laser tool that was included is neat and I used it for all of my pictures, which I had to hang with other hardware
I bought this Apple humidifier in early November. It stopped working soon at the first time I used it. I later found out that there was no water exchange unless you shake it or move it so that it might continue to work for a while and then stopped again. You have to repeat the above steps in order to keep it working. I contacted the manufacturer and got replacement. However, the new one has the same problem, and what's worse, it leaks!! I talked to the manufacturer again, but they didn't think there should be such problem and refused to do anything else. Now I have to keep this defected machine and have no idea what to do
Original purchase had two dead batteries, then a replacement set had the same results , it's as if they were bundling two dead batteries with every order. But the bottom line says it all in fine print on the back down low "MADE IN CHINA".
I've used GHDs and even though they're pricier they are worth every penny. After using the Hai Stick just one time, I had terrible split ends, and the stick did not 'glide' over my hair in the same way but seemed to tear. Terrible! I think I'll upgrade
I am a reviewer and I was checking out this 'sleep aid' when it struck me as strange that almost every review for this product sounds like a promotion of the product, not a review, AND note that the reviewers have only one review (click on their 'see all my reviews').  Beware of this shoddy marketing ploy.  This 'crud' alone merits my one star rating.  Amazon needs to censor these reviews
Terrible reception.  Tinny speaker.  Radio does not "remember" last used station when turned off.  Don't waste your money
I first bought the standard, and then the large size in an attempt to have a pair that fit well. I used them riding a bike in the winter months. Neither pair fit well and there are most likely very few people who will obtain a good fit. For the goggles to be snug enough to prevent wind from entering (and prevent tearing) causes great pressure above the ear. The rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely. I retired my Clics when I found foam padded sunglasses for motorcyclists.
I purchased the product, used it for 2 days and it has not worked since.  The compnay has yet to respond to my request for return, and Amazon excepts no liabilty.  Needless to say I wasted money
Very simple review - the hair dryer worked fine for a little over a month, then it didn't.  SAVE YOUR BOX IF YOU BUY THIS, you may need to return it
So, yeah, it mounts in your bathroom with the suction cups, and once it's mounted, it stays put pretty well.  Unfortunately, it has so far never actually been "fogless."  Get a good shower going, and the mirror fogs up in record time.  Splash some water on it, and you can see yourself for half a minute, but overall, this is a disappointment. 
This item is garbage; I purchased it about a month ago and already dumped it in the trash. Sure it looks and sounds good but take it from me, it's not worth the frustratio
I bought this press to do crafts.  The dimensions I were given were completely wrong.  I was told the Product in Inches (L x W x H): 9.0 x 20.0 x 15.0  It really is barely 6 1/2 inches wide and a little over 12 inches long, 17 inces long at the angle.   It was so small that I could maybe iron one sock at a time.  Also, the green light never came on after 1 hour of warming up and   Real waste of money and very misleading picture on the amazon website
I simply love most all of Olay products..especially the Regenerist line... until I bought the Tone Enhancer. It did nothing for my face.  Not one thing stated on the tube happened to my skin.  I guess I will use it as a moisturizer until it's gone.  
This cannot be the real thing.  The scent doesn't last 5 minutes.  What a waste of $50.00.  I am so disappointed. 
The description says "slipcover zips off for easy cleaning", but the product did not come with a slipcover.  The pillow itself is in the blue gingham pattern.  Now I have to find a slipcover that won't blend in with the blue gingham pattern underneath
At Christmas 2003 I was very excited with the $50 scale my family purchased for me. It worked as advertised for about six months. Then it displayed the ERR message more and more. We replaced the battery. Then it would not permit any function buttons to perform. We just sighed and used my expensive gift as any $7 bathroom scale. When it went completely blank this week, battery of no use, I hopped on the internet to see what anyone else's experience is. To be fair, I will contact the manufacturer and see if they can make it right. I hope they can. If not, I will see what the Weight Watchers scales is like. Sigh ...
If you get it wet it stops working, which is quite ironic given its a toothbrush. If you want something to work for a month or two its fine, otherwise avoid it entirely. I intitally thought the water was effecting the battery compartment but after cleaing the contacts and replacing the batteries it seems clear to me that the motor fails due to moisture, pretty quickly after ordinary use
This one is too small for a bedroom, just like a toy.  I returned this one and reordered Sunbeam 701-000 Ultrasonic Humidifier, which is much bigger.  Generally speaking, the ultrasonic humidifier is much quieter than the regular ones
These earrings are very pretty, but the post is WAY TOO THICK.  They killed my ears and I had to return them.  I would guess the post is at least 2.5 times as thick as a normal post, and my ears did not like it!!!
This supposedly "new" item looked like it had been either used a few times or someone had left it out in the rain.  It arrived with the one-page instruction sheet wrapped around the plastic tool.  The silver knob that you can see on the left side of this "tool" was rusted and would not turn very easily.  I'm not sure how this tool is effective in removing stubborn watch band pins.  Maybe this tool is effective in only removing pins from cheaply manufactured watches - much like this item.  When I attempted to use it, the entire plastic body would flex and I was afraid that it would snap if I twisted the knob any further.  Not worth the sale price that it was advertised.  The most effective way of using it was to remove the knob and pin from the apparatus and gently tap the end with a hammer in order to loosen the pins.  This is definitely not worth the sale price
It's doesn't look like as it appears in the photos...i bought it to gift  my husband and i wz very disappointed !! I returned it back !
Make sure you read the fine print!This bracelet is silver TONED, not sterling silver. The embossing is also not the greatest - clear on the one side, but hard to see the letters on the other
The product doesnt appear as is shown on the picture at all. Its not Red and its too small to even imagine.I knew it would appear bit smaller than on picture but this is beyond my imagination.The chain can break any time!!! And the stud!!!!!!!gosh...i cant even see it! Now i'm gonna check if its really gold or not!!DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY
I purchased this watch as a birthday present for my husband.  When he opened it he noticed that the days of the week were in both Spanish and English, and there doesn't seem to be a way to set it to just one or the other, since there were limited instructions with the watch.  By the time he looked at it there was no way for us to return it for a refund. Not happ
The Topaz earring is nice enough and probably worth $45, but be aware that it is smaller than it looks on the web page. The shaft that hangs between the two stones is about 5/16" long; the larger stone is about 3/16" wide and 1/4" high; the small stone is about 3/32" wide. Essentially, you get what you pay for
I got this as well under the assumption that it wasnt a high end watch.  After wearing Invicta's for a while this feels like a gum wrapper on my wrist.When I received it, I noticed the small scratches all over the crystal.  Nothing deep, but they really pick up the glare. Atomic signal, I am unable to get it to pick up one.  In Memphis, TN, I think I should be in range, and all my atomic clocks sync up fine.  I have tried it facing 4 different directions and also tried it outside to eliminate any interference from the house.  Still no good.Basically I spent 30 dollars for a cheap watch that doesnt even have a backlight.  Lesson learned
I ordered and paid for the Watch Band Adjusting Sizing Link Removing Tool Kit in Box, because of the picture of the tool box, and I receive a totally different equipment than what is on the picture. Please make the vendor send me the correct item I ordered.
The image really looks much better than the actual product. Stones are quite brownish, not red as one would expect of garnet. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase this.
I was extrememly unhappy with this necklace.  The picture on-line makes it look beautiful with light shining thru the amethyst (ha, looks like cut glass not real amethyst!)/Even putting it up to the natural light it looked dull/fake/plastic.  I emailed and got a reply I would get a full discount just mail it back.  Well, I mailed it back with insurance costing $6.55 after already paying shipping to have it sent to me.  Because I feel it was NOT advertised in a 'correct light' I asked for my shipping back for both charges and disputed the charge with my credit card company.  The refund from Amazon was only the cost of the necklace with neither shipping charge.  I am still going to dispute the the shipping charges because this jewelry did NOT look like it did on the website
It turns out the metal in the stems irritates my wife's ears.  I assume that the stems must not be white gold?  Other than that they are as expected.  Not perfect, but not bad for the price
So beware, for regular size watch's only.  Will not open a Marine Star, or anything bigger
I am very dissapointed with the band on this watch. The band absorbs and holds moisture. The last thing I want while exercising is a sopping wet watch band around my wrist. This could cause irration and a rash. WHAT WAS THE DESIGNER THINKING? Moreover, even when dry the band is rough to the skin and not comfortable to wear.I have liked Timex watches and felt the company was innovative and thoughtful in its watch designs. This watch band is neither innovative nor thoughtful in its design. I don't even want to wear this watch. I really don't think I should have to buy a new watch band for my brand new watch.Furthermore, Timex customer service is like dealing with a bunch of idiots. It is as if they read about 2 words of your email and then reply. I guess they think that if they keep feeding you stupid answers long enough, you'll eventually go awa
The display fogged up within a week. I got a replacement, and it's doing the same thing.  Would NOT recommend this product.
it tarnished on the first day and broke on the third day.  It is in the trash where it belong
I have not yet been able to fasten these things while they are in my ears. They are not useful to me at all
beautiful color, but very small in size, i guess i should have checked he pearl size first instead of just looking at the pictur
I understood the necklace and bracelet to be a matched set. When the pearls arrived the necklace was a different color and grade than the bracelet. It was really too bad because the bracelet was really rather nice looking. The neklace however was some kind of peach color and so full of flaws, Yeach..
I really thought this necklace looked good in the picture, and then I recieved it today wow! it is so light and the quality of the chain is terrible.  I have bought this for my boy friend for Christmas and now im wondering whether to even give it to him.  It should cost 20 bucks maybe.
The picture and description is not at all what you get. It is tiny, looks cheap and I was ashamed of bieng taken of advantage of. One expects better quality from Amazon. Do not buy ..go to a reputable jewelr. Amazon should stick to selling books
I never recieved this watch and about 30 or so days later Amazon refunded my payment.I don' understand why this supplier could not come up with such a common item but I got my money back so I am not upset.This is why I try not to buy from an Amazon seller, preffering to buy directly form the Amazon site
i've had three of these watches, but the band loosens up and falls off with no way to put it back on.  its ridiculus b/c seems like the band worsens in water and this is supposed to be fore Triathlons.  however the interval counter is a great feature.  but whats the point of having a watch that the band wont last more than a year or two
The quality is not so good.  I also got a smaller carat than I bought.  I contacted the seller for a return but they are not cooperative and did not provide information on how to return the item.  Looks like I will dispute the charge on my credit card.  Beware
I bought this watch because of the stylish looks, the reported reliability, and the fact that it was a watch that would never need batteries.  There were also other functions advertised that appealed to me.  I have owned Casios before and they took extreme wear while still maitaining their function.  This watch I have now will not allow me to go more than five days without the solar battery running out - usually at inopportune times where I really need a watch!  It has become very unpredictable.  Please do not get me wrong, it is a nice watch, I have gotten many favorable comments.  But I want a watch I trust to work day-in, day-out and not one I am constantly worried about.  I guess for someone who has the time to set the thing out in the sun on a regular basis, it would be a good purchase
I had a watch like this from Pulsar years ago and it worked well. This one I am returning to Amazon because it can't keep time and the calender keeps resetting to Jan 1. It was made in China so what can I expect. I am deeply disappointed in this product. No more Pulsars for m
I have had an early version of this watch for 17 years, and when it malfunctioned, I decided it was time to get a new one.  The previous watch had been repaired 2 times earlier, and unfortunately every time I got it back from COSERV, it would be less and less accurate, thus I decide to get a new one.  The new one was made in Maylasia vs Japan (I have read on this site that one needs to be concerned about that), and was lighter in weight, but kept time well for about one week.  I bumped the watch on a table (nothing severe, the previous watch endured much more) and it immediately started gaining more than 10 minutes per hour.  I had high hopes that this watch would at least meet, and hopely exceed the durability of the previous watch, but it did not make it passed one week of casual wear.  I returned it in disappointment
Earrings are pretty, but look cheap and very flimsy.  I know they are supposed to be delicate, but they are not what they appear to be from the picture
I received my new Fossil watch just a few weeks ago.  At first, I was pleased with the watch.  The overall appearance is nice, its very dainty with a thin band.  The green dial is a pale lime green, not too bright.  Everything was going good until yesterday when I noticed the watch seemed to have stopped working (and this is only after 2 weeks of having it!!).  I reset the time and it started ticking again, so I thought it was just a fluke.  Now it is working sometimes but is generally running slow (the time keeps falling farther behind).  If this is a battery problem already I am very disappointed that amazon would send out a new watch with an old battery.  I expect to take this up with them, as obtaining a new battery isn't very easy because there isn't a fossil store nearby.  In the manual it says to mail in the watch for a new battery, which costs $15!!  How inconvenient.  I am not impressed
Sometimes it sprays when she barks, most of the time it doesn't. So I would say its effectiveness has been rather low. It's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog. I can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine. (My children found this amusing.
the neighbor has a yapping mutt that barks night and day...since the police won't do anything about it, i bought this bark free...hahaha...what a joke...the darn dog barked more...anyway...it did zero for my problem and i consider it a waste of money...
One might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way, but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier.  Especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup.  I'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum, and then follow with a functional, well-designed good mop (like the old SteamMop they discontinued). These things function better as seperate units, which is why there's no washing machine that's also a dryer. The Flip-It is a very loud machine--so loud, that I didn't hear my phone ring in the same room.  This makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children, too.  It's difficult to push and feels like it's gripping to the floor.  It doesn't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets with it's big fat part-vacuum head.  And, when you're finished, it's a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter(which you're supposed to keep dry somehow) so you can look forward to a second job once you've finished the job of cleaning your floors.  And, because of the "flip it" back and forth design, the thing has no equilibrium...it fell to the floor at least 3 times, even when I was so careful to rest it against something...once when this happened, the "dirty water" recovery tank hit the floor, fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor.  A true nightmare.  I bought this product because I could no longer buy replacement filters/pads for my Bissell SteamMop, and I thought I had better give the latest and greatest a try, but, sadly, I was disappointed.  I don't review things often, but I felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean.  This contraption is not your answer. On a side note, I wrote to Bissell to bring back the SteamMop (what an excellent product), so I'm hoping that they will one day
If you are looking for something with great sound quality or even great accuracy in measurment, this isn't for you. The radio is hard to use since it doesn't have any indication of what frequency you are on, and every time you move it gets overwhelmed by static. The pedometer function is marginal at best. But its what you would expect for $15.
I wanted to buy something that would remove the taste of chlorine from the kitchen faucet but even with the Brita it still tasted like chlorine. After about 2 weeks it started to drip from the where the Brita screws into the faucet. So now you don't have filtered water. My husband replaced washer and it still dripped. If you accidently put the hot water on while someone in the house just before used the filtered part the filter is ruined
I purchased this opener 12/6/06 and the motor quit 3/5/07.  What really troubles me is that I probably only open five or six cans a week.  Please don't waste your money
I have two cats both less than 5 months old. I bought CitiKitty training kit hoping it would save me from scooping the litter box. It turned out a piece of flimsy junk that's way over priced. My cats would rather do their business anywhere but on this piece of plastic. Save your money and use it on something more useful
streaks and scratched the front of my dishwasher. Does a very poor job.
The way this Steamer was advertised, I really thought it gave out alot of steam, and lasted a decent amount of time.  I tried it a few times and was very disappointed. I returned the item
I purchased this through Amazon but returned it.  I intended to use this with their 3qt 10-inch saute pan. But it is huge! It is not an elegant design for this size pan. All Clad should have designed a screen that matches this pan instead of a one-size-fits-all from 8 inches to 13 inches.  Furthermore, the unique handle that curves over the screen takes more storage room.  My wife didn't like it.  Back to the drawing boards All-Clad
I purchased this BonJour frother to replace my old AeroLatte frother.  The difference between the two brands is startling!  The BonJour frothing tip is a solid wavy metal tip which actually OVER-froths the milk.  This causes the bubbles to keep breaking down.  I can only achieve a very thin layer of foam and it won't last long.  On the othe hand, the Aerolatte frothers(also widely available with several models on Amazon) uses more of an open-metal mesh tip on their wand which must be responsible for how thick and dense a foam it will create.  I'm buying another Aerolatte and will use the BonJour wand for things that don't need thick foam (like mixing salad dressing)
I bought Cat Sitter1 for my 3 cats, they enjoyed it so much I gave Cat Sitter 2 a go. What a disappointment!!They were bored within 5 minutes of it being on!  The entire dvd is of birds and only birds as compared to Cat Sitter 1 that has a variety of animals that catches the cats attention span in short segments. Trust me, if you have to choose between the two, don't spend your money on on CS2, however, it may appeal to the (human) avid bird watcher...(?)
I bought this product on my mom's suggestion, because she was impressed with the suction power.  Not only did the suction power fade over the first few months of ownership, but within 6 months the vacuum was completely broken.  I called in to customer service because it was still under warranty, and they were anything but helpful.  They sent me to a small shop 45 minutes away to have it fixed, which took over a month.  They even lost my paperwork.  One month later it broke again, and customer service suggested I take it out in my backyard, take the vacuum apart, and blow the small holes with an air compressor to clean it out.  For $400, this is ridiculous.  I want my $100 vacuum back
While the water tasted better, this model didn't last for more than about two months before leaking and eventually spraying water all over the place
The first time I used it I couldn't even boil water in it on my flat surface stove! A notice that came with it said, "This pot may not work on all stoves, refer to the owners manual." (No owners manual was sent with it.) As soon as the water started to heat, the pot danced and wobbled all over and the water was sloshing out of the top! Nothing in the web site ad referred to the pot not working on a flat surface. It would have been nice to have known before ordering, as I am not a pro cook and have no special knowledge of these details
This toaster lasted for about 8 months before it started to burn toast on one side, even at low settings.  We are very disappointed with this purchase
I should have followed the advice of most of the reviewers here before I purchased this humidifer.  There was a large mineral buildup but that was the least of it.  Worked fairly good for three months but then it stopped working.  One of the controls literally "froze" in place and the machine was unusable.  No way to fix it - had to throw it away.  What a shame.  Next time I will pay closer attention to what people write.  My advice - by something other than a Honeywell.  I have three packages of filters that I purchased separately - another waste of money
I own the graphite style of this set.  I was originally very happy with the purchase - the set looked great, didn't chip easily, and was a great size.After a year of use I've come up with a list of problems:The clear glazed surface on the plates and bowls can be scored by utensils which allows water/dirt to penetrate to the porous ceramic below leaving stains that cannot be removed.The semi-matte finish acquires a "powdery", almost bleached, look to it after many washings (says dishwasher safe, guess that means the colors don't wash away immediately)My biggest complaint:  We bought these because they were "microwave safe".  I don't know what microwave safe means to most people, but it means to me that I could put a plate, bowl or cup in the microwave, heat up the contents, and then safely remove the object and use it.  In the case of the set I purchased, it only seems to mean that the item placed in the microwave will not explode.Unfortunately in the case of the Sango Graphite set, it means that the contents of the set are sheilded by the (plate/bowl/cup) and that the contents will emerge warm at best while you burn your hand attempting to extract the (plate/bowl/cup) that has soaked all of the energy up from the microwave.  They get VERY hot!  (Cup of water heated for 2 mins results in water temperature of 120F while cup surface is 170F!) I've only broken 2 items from the set, both times I dropped the items after getting them partly out of the microwave and realizing that my fingers were being burned (first time I thought it was a fluke, second time I learned my lesson) and dropped the item on the hard stove surface below the microwave.  I emailed Sango several times and received no response at all.  While I liked the set a lot initially, I have been very disappointed over time with its quality. I will never purchase another from Sango again
I bought this sheet set, the newest blue comforter with the light saber duel, and the micro bead pillow as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old son.  He, too, loves Star Wars...and as I read the other reviews, Im nodding my head.  THESE SHEETS FEEL LIKE BURLAP!  I have washed them regularly since December...with no improvement.  They dont fade, though..which I suppose was the motivation behind the manufacturer making them with 70% polyester and only 30% cotton. VERY STIFF AND SCRATCHY
Unfortunately, I ordered these twice and received rectangular bakers instead.  This was *not* Amazon's fault, but Emile Henry's for mislabling the box as oval bakers when they were not.  In fairness to Amazon, they tried to make it right but had a difficult time doing so since the contents of the box were mislabled.Althought I would have preferred the oval bakers, I kept the rectangular ones and do like them
I am becoming steadily more disillusioned with the KitchenAid brand. This blender is only one of several KA appliances I have purchased that only lasted about a year. I don't use a blender much, maybe once a month, so when this died after only eleven months, I was shocked. KitchenAid was no help whatsoever. My husband took it apart & discovered that the motor still works, but the on/off switch went bad; however we found that having it repaired would cost as much as a new blender!! After years of brand loyalty, I am sad to say that I will not be buying anymore KitchenAid
I'm a student in college, and when my first hamper ripped, I decided that it was time to buy a sturdier hamper. My roommate rarely does his laundry, so he has huge loads, but his hamper manages to carry it all. I saw the Whitney Design hamper online, which looked nearly identical to my roommate's hamper, so I bought it.When the hamper arrived, I put my clothes in it, and prepared to do laundry. The shoulder strap ripped right off. I didn't even fill up the hamper all the way, as is shown in the picture. Amazon sent me a replacement, but now I am afraid of using the shoulder strap again, and I have to awkwardly grasp the sides around the metal wires. This hamper may be able to function, but not well. And for a college student, this is definitely not sturdy enough
The set is lovely and coordinates perfectly with my OCR china set. The box is also beautiful. I wish they'd give you a diagram for placement of the flatware in the box for those of us who are first-timers.
We have been searching for a solution to our very uncomfortable seats in our Ford Windstar van. This cushion did not help
You never ever use an electric wok to cook Chinese food.  It is all about the fire and the intensity of the heat.  Only people that use this are people whom have no idea what they're doing.  Do yourself a favor and purchase a real wok
I have the black version, but I'm writing reviews for the white and red as well to save you from buying this toaster model.  From day one, it hasn't been able to toast anything evenly - be it frozen / fresh /refrigerated  bread / bagel / english muffin - you name it.  If you don't believe me, see the photo I uploaded.  The toast is burnt and raw at the same time
Got one as a Christmas present - great concept, but the performance falls well short of the promise.As another reviewer noted, wine from my wine fridge (56 deg.) registered as 74 deg. when placed into the unit; wine at room temp (72 deg.) regularly registered 78 deg. or so.  Although the unit ran through it's cycle and indicated wine had been chilled to the proper temperature it never was.  In fact, if you put the bottle back into the unit immediately and started it again it would register a temperature about 10 degrees warmer than it had indicated just seconds earlier.I tried about half-a-dozen times over a couple days, but it never worked properly.We returned the unit to the store for credit
This griddle performed very poorly and I will not be keeping it.  It cooked very unevenly (the left side of a 4-inch pancake was almost burned, while the right side was practically raw) and the pancakes stuck, even though it is supposed to be preseasoned (it's cast iron) and I heated it first before applying a light coat of vegetable oil.  It also did not sit securely on my gas stove, due to the 'grill' ridges on the other side -- it rocks back and forth slightly--even thought the box says it is suitable for all cooking surfaces except glass.  Because I use my griddle almost every weekend, I am considering the Broil King Ultra Large electric giddle, which got Cook's Illustrated top recommendation in its 2003 tests.  
i bought it. didn't work. exchanged it. the new one didn't work. same problem--the pump is very weak and just barely seaps out a few drops of liquid soap...that's all. and yes, it does very easily rust.spend the extra $5 and get something better
The spice rack looks nice.  Won't know the quality until I can use it and see how much weight it will take.  I had a horrible time getting in under the cabinet.  It is definitely a 2-person job and there was only me.  The self-adhesive tabs didn't work at all even to just put the spice rack up to use the screws.  Very awkward to use the screws.  Doesn't allow for any room especially the back screws.  I did the wrong thing by taking the extending arm hardware off to get the spice rack in place and to make it easier to screw it under the cupboard and that is where it sits.  Now to get the hardware back onto the extender arms is almost impossible.  I wouldn't have purchased this knowing how hard it is to attach to the underneath of the cabinet.  Took much too much time to get it into place
We purchased this purcolator Christmas 2003, and ended up returning the first one after it did not work out of the box.  Amazon was great in sending us out another via exchange.  The second percolator worked.  However, I wished I'd have saved my money.  The coffee basket allowed too many coffee grounds to end up in the coffee.  Don't take that last cup.  You will also need a carafe to store the coffee in after percolating.  The percolator maintains the heat too high when ready, and boils the coffee continuously.  Mmmm, burnt coffee!
I just got this... took it out of the box... plugged it in ... and... it does not work
This was a horrible egg slicer.  I thought something from KitchenAid that was advertised to slice strawberries or mushrooms would be worthwhile, but was I wrong.  Worked fine for eggs, but broke on the first strawberry.  My previous one broke on the first mushroom!  Don't bother.  Use a knife.  Save the slicer for the eggs
I'm not sure how well this coffeemaker works.  I purchased one from Amazon and received one that was obviously in used condition.  The glass was water stained and not factory packaged.  There wasn't a manual or any instructions.  1 star for Amazon on this one
These are great towels if you can get them.  They are very soft and a great price but I ordered them in December and they came in one at a time. Took over 3 months to complete the order and still did not recieve the full order because after 3 months they refunded my money on one towel that was out of stock.  When I ordered them they stated that they were in stock and ready to ship.Buy these only if you have a life time to get the
Product worked well for several months - providing sufficient heating for moderate-sized space.  However, heater now only provides heat for approximately 1-2 minutes after turning on, then *sparks* and the heating mechanism fails.Dangerous for a space heater, no
Unless you love the look of this pepper grinder, I'd suggest you look elsewhere. When compared to a generic grinder, this product produces inferior and very inconsistent grinds. I've gone so far as to grind peppercorns onto a white sheet of paper to look at them. With this grinder you'll always get a huge variation in the grind. Some of the pieces of the peppercorns will be large enough that it would give anyone pause to wonder whether foreign matter had somehow entered the dish. The oval top is quite slippery and when you tighten down the top nut to reduce the grind to something that will prove acceptable, you'll have trouble turning it. Not recommended
We bought this rice cooker because of the reputable brand name. We have been using it for about 4 months now. It cooks good rice. However, the rice does not stay fresh for over 3 days sometimes regardless of what other reviewers said. We've got spoiled rice in it a few times already with no understandable reason. And the rice was in "keep warm" mode at all times. In addition, if you forget to stir the rice and leave it in the "keep warm" mode for a day, the top layer becomes very hard and the bottom layer becomes very soggy. So, you do need to stir the rice quite often to prevent the dryout. I haven't tried cooking porridge or any other kind of rice besides white rice. If I were to decide all over again, I would stay away from this rice cooker. I thought I've bought a top-notched product, now I regret that I spent this much on a rice cooker
Neither the salt mill or pepper grinder work well.  It takes forever  to get salt and pepper from the squeezing of the handles together and still not an adequate amount.  Perhaps the blades that crunch the S&P are not sharp enough?  Very disappointed in product
This item comes with many warnings as it should. It can be hazardous to use this heater with an adaptor for a two pronged outlet. The product itself is of high quality and runs well just not when you are in the process of renovating a house
These refills are ridiculous.  Yes, they are simple to use, but the maximum life span is about two weeks.  I've gone through at least 6 sets of refills this winter season already, and the results are consistent.  I run the Vornado humidifier 24/7, as recommended by the manufacturer and clean it regularly, especially when changing out the wicks.  There is never any gunky build-up to blame the short life-span on.  These are clearly manufactured to last only two weeks.  My ancient Duracraft, which is no longer manufactured, but is the best humidifier I've ever had, easily goes 4 to 6 weeks between wick filter changes, with no deterioration in performance.  This will be the last year I use the Vornado...for next year I'll be purchasing a second Air-o-Swiss, which runs like a dream, but is quite pricey up front
The first dishwasher that I received from Etronics was dented, dirty and looked as though it had been used.  I complained, they picked it up, and one month later I got the replacement.  It wasn't in much better shape, but I kept it anyway because I was tired of waiting. The dishwasher cycle takes about 90 minutes, and although it cleans well, the adapter to hook it up is cheaply made, and it leaks even with teflon tape.  I would not make this purchase again
Poor carafe design makes this Mr. Coffee machine a waste of money. We bought this model to replace our old Mr. Coffe machine after we broke the carafe and couldn't purchase a replacement for that model.  We loved our old Mr. Coffee, but this purchase was completely dissatisfying because, as other reviewers have noted, it's virtually impossible to pour without spilling the coffee/water everywere.  After the first few uses, we decided to purchase a different coffee maker
Ok i have a couple of these tongs sitting in a box and trust me that is where they belong.They are hard to use because when you move the slide lock up they open completly wide and if you want to quickly lock or unlock then forget it there are beter ones on the market that can be locked and unlocked with one hand not two like these require and the metal feels cheap and they are very light a slight wind will knock them right onto the floor.Spend a little more cash for the OXO locking tongshttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000CCY1L/qid=1122017598/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_sbs_1/002-9480983-6492045?v=glance&s=kitchen&n=507846Trust me you will like them bette
This product does work and produces great tasting water--for a while.  I thought maybe we'd done something to make it leak, but a guest said his did the same thing in about the same amount of time (approx 8 months).  There's a part of the filter assembly that becomes loose and leaks, and then eventually squirts water all over the place.  There is no way to fix it.  We won't be buying this brand again.
After reading all of the positive reveiws and only a few negative ones I purchased this humidifier back in Dec. Well here it is early Feb and this thing just plain sucks. I have a digital humidistat sitting right next to it in a med size room (13x13) and it never reaches higher that 29%. In the dry months of winter 29% is unacceptable, and my eyes nose and throat would agree. So don't do what I did, and save your money. Or if you must try it, just be prepared to send it back or donate it to goodwill. Enjoy
I received my bowls today and was very disappointed.  How bowls this size can be referred to as "mixing" bowls I cannot fathom.  Neither do I know what could be mixed in bowls so small.  The second from the largest bowl is about the size of a normal cereal bowl. The bowls nest so the largest bowl holds the "cereal" bowl and the next to the smallest bowl nests in the cereal bowl.  The smallest bowl is a joke.  I doubt it would hold an extra large egg without running over.  The material is nice...melamine... and colorful but those are the only positive statements I can make
I was looking for a set of steak knives and came across the infomercial one night. It sounded great and much cheaper then the Henckels of the world. And look at all the different types of knives. NOT WORTH IT. These knives don't cut well at all (as compared to my Henckel knife). I wish I didn't buy it and just purchased a couple of good quality knives.Also, the block holder is HUGE!  It takes up too much space.  
Okay, I bought for the price. And it is effective enough. But it is very clumsy and unergonomic, so that after a couple minutes of use it is difficult to handle any longer. The main problems are: Balance of weight, and the switch.First, the switch: Because it is a cheap push-in button, which must be constantly depressed to keep the knife on, you lose optimum control quickly. The handle is badly placed for this, as your thumb must always be on TOP of the handle and forward toward the front of it, but you can't hold your hand up there because your wrist angle will be completely wrong for cutting. In addition, keeping that button depressed is difficult not only because it does require a constant application of pressure at a different direction from both the grasp and the application of the knife, but because the button sinks deep into the handle, so your thumb is inside the handle as you're trying to hold and control the knife: Quick cramp. Moreover, as you're pushing it in, if the food you're cutting is moist (like a turkey), juices may run onto the handle, your thumb--and into the hole into which you're pressing the button. NOT safe. A couple times I've wondered whether that shooting pain in my thumb was from nerve torture or electric shock; either way, it wasn't good.Then the weight distribution of the knife is not very good. Look at the huge bulk of the motor--and then look at where the handle is located, and how it is designed. There's no way to hold this at a proper angle with the handle shaped as it is. Add in the need to be depressing the power button as you're holding it awkwardly, and...2 stars for effectiveness; minus 3 for bad functional design
I purchased this fry pan in June of this year - and it is almost to a state where it is ready to be thrown away as of December 1st.  I would have expected the nonstick surface to be of superior quality and durability from All-Clad, but the sad truth is that I have had cheap grocery store pans that have maintained the coating far longer, and a small fraction of the cost.  After just a few weeks the surface became scratched on this pan and the coating started to come off in the food - ick!  I love the uncoated All-Clad, but I will be looking elsewhere for nonstick in the future
The unit has nice, large digits, but the wireless sensors don't work consistantly.  The system works for perhaps 3 days and then the wireless link goes down.  We have to remove the remote sensor batteries and reinstall them for the link to be re-established
The Rubbermaid Chrome Dish Drainer arrived in a timely fashion.  However, the utensil holder was not included.  I promptly contacted the seller by email.  Their representative apologized profusely in her response and assured me that the utensil holder would arrive promptly.  Two weeks later, I did not have a utensil holder and I had received no further communication from the company.  I plan to return the item and dispute the charge on my credit card.  I also have found the same item under a different brand name for a cheaper price at Bed, Bath and Beyond
I knew when I purchased these sheets for only 13 dollars they weren't going to be great, but really these are ridiculous.  They are incredibly  thin sheets and they pill easily.  They also do not stay on my mattress, I am constantly having to put them back on.  I will not purchase these sheets again
The other commentators stress features of this kettle that pretty much any cordless electric kettle will have.  It pales in comparison to my old Hamilton Beach, however, in several respects.  Well, really, one big one.  It's a plastic object.  And it gets very hot.  Too hot.  Hot enough that it smells like it's melting itself.  I got this as a gift, rinsed it thorougly, boiled a pot just to clean it - and it stunk like melted plastic.  Ran it again to try and get the smell out.  Same thing.  Rinsed it with cold water and tried again - still melted odor.  The outside of the kettle near the heating element was very hot even after it shut off (a problem I didn't have with my previous kettle, which I lost in a move), and when I touched it a melted plastic film tacked on to my finger.  You can bet I put this right in the mail back to Amazon.  I normally would hesitate to return a gift, but I'd rather the person have his money back than this thing sit on my counter collecting dust
I ordered this product based on the reviews that were available at the time. I was sorely disappointed. There is no measuring cup, so all water amounts must be estimated (the unit has three "lines" to help, but nothing that denotes how much water to use if you wish to cook a specific number of eggs); there is no buzzer when the unit is finished, so unless you babysit it, everything ends up overcooking. This is a great unit to avoid purchasing unless you plan to always cook 8 eggs at a time and want them all hardboiled
I bought this to make meaty stews with rice for my dogs.  It works for a while then stops working, or just goes on warm.  They replaced it three times--everytime it went out.  This seems to be common with cheap rice cookers--see the reviews on the RIVAL RCS 200, they all go out within days or weeks!  I guess Black and Decker and Rival used the same Chinaman to design these useless things.  I can't understand why Amazon et al are still selling these when obviously they do NOT work.  The companies will replace them but all replacements go out immediately. In frustration I bought the Aroma 60-cupper for $125--and after two months that also went out.  Any suggestions on a 20-cup rice cooker with longevity would be appreciated
Worked just fine for over a year, then started behaving very oddly.Among the various problems this TOB-30BC unit exhibited, the most dangerous was switching itself on even when the main control was set to off, not switching itself off at the end of a toasting cycle, sending alarms when switched off, not being able to switch the unit off!  This unit neds to be unplugged from the outlet and I consider it to be a fire hazard.  Repeated communications to Cuisinart remain unanswered.
The written description of this heater led me to believe that it would perform like the 2 5-yr-old Vornado models that are the best electric heaters I've ever had.  The VH2 has major flaws.  It's single fan speed is way too fast, causing heated air to be cool/cold within 10 ft of the heater.  The fan cannot be slowed down.  The thermostat causes the fan to stop and start in ridiculously short intervals; thereby wasting energy I believe.  Finally, the thermostat is set so that when at the highest (hottest) setting it doesn't allow the heater to bring even the immediate area around it to more than 70 degrees F.I've had the heater &lt;1 mo and will attempt to return it for a full refund in another wk or 2 as soon as I have an alternative brand in my home
I received the sleepwarmer blanket last week and have been very disapointed--it is just not warm enough!!  Even on the highest setting it doesn't get warm enough initially.  It is fine for keeping warm during the night but I want to be able to turn it down to keep warm and have it pretty hot in the beginning and that is not at all what this does.  It is nice and soft but you can absolutely feel the wires as well.  Not worth the money at all
do not buy this.  the steamer stops working in a month and it cannot be fixed.  cleaning doesn't help at all, even after carefully following the instructions.  very cheap, no good
Saw these canisters and fell in love with them. Couldn't wait to get them and when I did they were broken into a million pieces.  They replaced them very timely but one lid is almost too small and the seal doesn't fit properly.  Another lid fits so tight it takes two hands to get the lid off.  I was disppointed in the quality.  I wouldn't buy these again even if I had to buy something more expensive
I've had my vacuum for a few years now only b/c I'm too lazy to buy another one. However, I am at the end of my rope. From Day 1 of having this vacuum the belt broke frequently -- and most of the time I was vacuuming on hardwood. If I accidentally ran over a cat toy or piece of string or anything bigger than a crumb, the belt broke. I took to buying lots of extra belts whenever I went to the store. The other day - surprise - the belt broke for no apparent reason. I promptly replaced it and it broke again the minute I turned the vacuum on. I say: NO MORE. I am now determined to buy the best vacuum EVER. I don't care how much it costs!! The only nice thing about this vacuum is the ability to use to the hose/attachments without having to flip a switch; and it is pretty powerful. But that's it. Changing the cannister can be messy and like a few other reviewers, I frequently run over the cord. Something just wasn't designed right there... You've been warned
The larger of the bowls was broken when I recieved it so it was not packet very well. I have used the smaller bowl and loved it.
The add said it would seperate small berry seeds.  The holes on the smallest grate are about 1/8".  You could fit 20 seed through one of them.  Very disappointing
This "nifty" piece of machinery was the one choice at my local store and so, I got it. I really wanted to get the Air-O-Swiss one but alas, it cannot be found or shipped to Canada... weirdly.So far, I am less than impressed. Took me forever to even get it working. The constant resetting is tiring. I did find a solution (initial anyway) - you fill the tank but also fill the inside reservoir (where the round filter is) and then it works.The noise it makes is NOT easy to get used to, no matter how tired you are.I am trying it for one night, then if I can't sleep I will return it. It's not worth the money. My advice? Save up and get the Air-O-Swiss
I had this vacuum for about a month.  The suction was so bad that after EVERY room I had to empty what little dirt was in the canister just to get back some suction.  I hated it!  Not only that but the bagless was a pain!  I had to go outside everytime to empty the dang thing because it was so messy!  Not to mention that trying to get the canister out and back in was the hardest thing ever.  It made even more of a mess trying to get it out and in!  I did not want that in my house!  I absolutely hated this vacuum
I'm terribly disappointed. The feed chute is tiny (barely big enough for two fingers), the tray above the chute doesn't hold anything (most things fall out), clean-up is a nightmare, and it takes forever to get a usable glass of juice.Stick with a centrifugal juicer like the Breville Elite 800, unless you enjoy torturing yourself
I pre-ordered this right after I saw it on "I Want That Tech Toys" and it finally arrived just after Christmas, after nearly five months of waiting. The first few days had serious set up issues where the water wouldn't drain. My cats were interested in watching it but since the water wouldn't go out they were not interested in using it for its intended purpose. I had it sitting next to their Litter Maid and they wouldn't use the new box. Their excessive use overwhelmed and burned out the Littermaid motor so it had to be thrown out. Now, with just the Cat Genie I hoped they would adapt. They did not - they pee on the floor, poop on the floor. Finally one of the four was willing to use the new box... then it stopped draining and even that one cat would't go near it because it was full of water. I am at my wits end, plugging and unplugging trying to reset it. I have made two attempts to contact the parent company who makes these with no return calls or emails. I am very tech saavy, we have lots of robots around here... roombas, scoobas, spotbots and others so this cat genie was ideal but I guess it isn't ready yet.
I ordered this thinking it would be great for grinding up "big people food" for my grandson.  It could not even grind up a soft hot dog!  We kept trying softer and softer foods to see if it would be able to grind them but since the blade is a cheap plastic material (painted gray to look like metal!) it just couldn't do the job.  Sheesh, I mashed up a banana faster and better than this grinder.  Total waste of money.  Also, my husband tried to put the handle on the carrying case and it snapped right in two.  Junk
What a piece of crap. Just putting this together broke it. And was missing one of the snap parts. Truely a waste of money
Probably have bashed this product enough, but it is insulting to still see &quot;Sturdy lid and side handles for improved grip&quot; advertised.  In no time at all, the handles broke off like peanut brittle; glad I wasn't carrying it around the kitchen. No wonder no one carries replacement handles. Don't know what's better, but sure won't try Rival again
I bought this for my mother a year ago, and I was recently looking for a vacuum myself, so being a person big on checking reviews on items before purchasing, I asked her how she liked it. She said she liked it, and thought it worked well, and loved how light it was (she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis). So... needless to say I went out and purchased it, trusting mother deartest's opinion.I HATE IT! I just moved out of my house, and I had to clean (vacuum) every room in the house. It took three times the amount of time it would ave taken a regular heavy Hoover vacuum to do the job. One sweep for a normal heavy vacuum turns into thirty for this piece of s*** just to pick up some damn crumbs. Also, you have to clean it out every five minutes because the filter gets covered so easily, after only vacuuming about half a room.It WILL NOT suck up hair. Rather, it gets tangled in the wheel, and looks like a thirty year old hairbrush that was never, ever cleaned out. Hence, making it harder and harder to pick things up (not that it does to begin with).It's loud, time-consuming, and the biggest waste of money.The only thing it has going for it is its weight, which is highly overshadowed by how much it sucks anyway.OH... AND I've used this product ONCE. ONCE! One time of use pretty much was all it was worth. IF THAT.I'm taking it back... and throwing it at them.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PEOPLE!!
The windtunnel II is a poorly constructed vacuum.  It is less than six months old and the motor for the HEPA filter had to be replaced.  It is very messy when you have to empty the tank.  Dust and dirt collect around the hepa filter and falls down when you are emptying the tank.
Not up to standard set by other KitchenAid Pro Line appliances. When dessert is frozen will not dispense even with mix engaged, when thawed, dessert turns to near water consistancy. No way to remove dessert other than through dispenser. No control to modulate freezing, either on or off, manual setting. When front comes off for cleaning, retained liquid runs down the front of the machine short of the drip pan.
Very hard to get any actual pepper to come out of this thing.  I just put some pepper on eggs and it took over 10 squeezes.  Imagine trying to grind pepper out for a stock pot full of soup.  Impossible
The machine looks great. It sat nicely on our counter-top next to the Kitchen Aid mixer and looked really classy. If that was all I wanted to do with it, then I would have been very happy with it, but I actually wanted to make decent lattes and espressos.Firstly, I found the steamer wand to be awkward to use. It rotates, but has little movement up or down. As a result, I found it pretty impossible to steam milk without spilling some on the counter-top when I was finished. It produced good foam though.Secondly, the indicator lights are so dim I found it difficult to tell whether the machine was ready or not.Finally the espressos I made had no crema at all. I have been making them for 3 years with our current Saeco machine with a delightful crema on each one. After pulling the shot it continued to leak water from the filter holder. The machine was constantly leaking water & steam when it got up to temperature and the design of the drip tray is such that it is awkward to empty it without spilling everywhere.In summary: If you just want a pretty machine to sit on your counter, buy this machine. If you want to make decent espresso-based drinks, don't
The image in this product is misleading. It looks like this product contains more than 1 piece, but when I opened it I got only one piece which is very small size and also the quality is inferior
I bought this board along with another brand.  This one falls off the sink and is constantly dumping my cuttings in the sink.  It also warped within one month of my purchasing it.  The wood has also splintered.  Not my idea of a good cutting board.  I would not recommend it to my friends, nor would I purchase it as a gift
I received my Granos as a birthday present two years ago.  As had already been reported here, the machine is great--when it works.  I thought I was the only one who had leak problems but most everyone who wrote a review here reported the same problem. Leak from the bottom and leak from the water container.I called customer service to report the problem and they sounded like they've never heard of the problem.  They asked me to return the machine but I didn't bother.  A good customer service should have already heard the problem before customers call.A $600 espresso machine should last more than two years.  I can't believe a company like Bodum is not concerned about its product.  I'm buying another espresso machine and it's not going to be Bodum again
This item is for serving only, it will not keep the liquid hot or cold more than 30 mins
Omie & Izzy are brother/sister kitties about 6 months old. They received this as a gift:"It's fun when someone plays with us with a chasing toy but we don't play in it much on our own. One of the wires broke already and we've had it less than one month." 
There isn't much to like about these sheets. They wrinkle like crazy when you wash them and the stitching leaves a lot to be desired - hanging threads are all over the place. I would not recommend these sheets at all
Had major problems with it leaking and ended up having to get another (different brand). I was shocked and a upset because of the mess it left in my kitchen.
Well after reading the reviews of this vacuum, I decided to give it a try.  I have had it a month now and I have to say that I am sorry I bought this behemoth.  Right out of the box and trying it for the first time I noticed things that I didn't like.  I thought I 'd give it some time though and hoped I could adjust.  Here is what I found:1.  The vacuum is very heavy as other reviewers have stated.2.  Worse than the vacuum being heavy, the darn thing is really hard to push.  Even on hard smooth surfaces it's hard to push.  I have not figured out yet what the heck would cause it to have so much drag.  For it to drag on hard surfaces, it must be a design flaw.3.  The on/off power switch is foot operated.  Not a terrible thing but Dirt Devil decided to put the darn thing out of view and hidden by the accessory carriage.  On my first time of vacuuming I accidentally ran over a sock and it got caught in the floor brush.  While the brush belt was smoking I fumbled around for the damn power switch.  I finally had to reach down and press the switch by hand because I couldn't find it by looking down.  It must have taking me eight to ten seconds to finally turn the thing off.  Unfortunately, the damage was done.  The belt snapped. How nice.  I really liked that.  First time out and the belt snapped. Another note about the switch; there have been times I have had to repeatedly press the switch because it would not lock off.  It takes a firm steady pressure to turn it off.  The fun part of this annoyance is that you think you have it turned off because the motor starts winding down and as soon as you let up on it the motor powers up. Couple that with not being able to really see the darn thing it's a real challenge.  Maybe Dirt Devil thinks we have eyes on our toes.  Hey Dirt Devil here is an idea.  How about putting the on/off switch on the push handle.  What a novel idea. Doh!4. The vacuum hose that detaches is really unwieldy.  It has a long plastic handle that you hold onto and that makes it really difficult to manipulate the hose.  The main reason being is that the hose it too short.  It's like you are fighting the hose all the time.  It gets tiring.5.  The detachable hose is really hard to re-install in it's port.  You have to wedge it in there really hard to get the thing to seat.  6.  The vacuum is terrible on rugs, on any of the floor height settings. It bunches up the rugs and starts smoking baby.  My old vac was not much better but at least with the old one I could lift the vac and kind of drag it over the rug and it wouldn't get all caught up.  I tried the same thing with the Dirt Devil and forget about it.  It jammed up every time.7.  The vacuum is poor at getting dirt off of hard surface floors.  It just moves the dirt around or spits it out the back.  I have to use the hose attachment.8.  The vacuum is horrible on steps.  With my old vac I could drag the vac across each step whilst the vacuum is locked in the upright position.  Easy deal.  The Dirt Devil does not work that way.  When the vacuum is in the upright position the brush is too high off the carpet to do any good.  The only option is to disengage the lock and vacuum with the back slanted.  One little problem with that.  The weight of the vac cause the seal at the base of the dirt canister to open and air begins leaking.  You don't get a good positive suction.  So, you have to play with the position of the tilt to get the proper seal.  The problem is that the proper position you need is so close to where the vacuum locks into the upright position.  It often locks and so then you have to try and un-lock it while balancing this heavy behemoth.  It's a joke.  The only half easy way to do steps is if use the detachable hose and attach the power brush.  The only problem with that is you are fighting the ill designed hose and heavy vacuum, and not to mention that the brush attachment will only really get surface dirt.  If you try putting pressure for some deep cleaning the brush stops. Now for Pros:  1.  The vacuum does seem to get the carpets pretty clean.  It has good suction and it raises the carpet fibers right up.  It almost makes my carpet look like new, and I do not see an excessive amount of carpet fibers in the dirt canister.  Some vacuums like to just tear up carpets.2.  The rotating brush attachment works pretty good for removing cat hair off of couches and bedding.  All in all this vacuum was very very poorly designed.  I may just have to donate this thing and buy something else.  I can't imagine fighting this thing every week for years to come or until the motor dies.  Maybe I'll be lucky and the motor will die soon.  Then I'll just throw the darn thing out and buy something other than Dirt Devil.  Steve
This is horrible at keeping coffee hot. It gets cold quick.Buy another brand. I bought this model and a larger Zojirushi 1.9 liter stainless steel model at the same time. They both are bad and leak heat vapor out like a hissing snake with no off switch. The 1.9 ltr one also leaks fluid out even before you press the open button.  Also it is the worst stainless steel I have ever seen. It stains instantly and for ever. I had another Zhjirushi for more than a decade and it was fantastic. But something has happened over the last 10 years, their quality has really gotten bad
I received this blender for x-mas last year.  It has some nice design features (good heavy base to prevent tipping, measuring cup built into the cap).  However, I experienced the same problems that others here have -- the blender doesn't do well with anything thick like milkshakes.  It just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly, forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart.  While it worked OK for a while, the cutter unit mysteriously jammed after about 9 months
We bought a well-reviewed carpet vacuum from Amazon last year, and absolutely love it. After that positive experience, we were looking for something for our kitchen, bathroom and hallway floors and came upon this cleaner.Starting with the dry vac part, that seems to get smallish pieces of dirt fine, but anything Cheerio sized or larger it pushes around on the floor unless you lean the vacuum back. Which would be fine, but if you lean it back too far, there is a suction filter thing (made for the wet vac part) that sticks and you have to turn off the vacuum and wait about 10 seconds for the suction to release that piece before you can continue. Anyway, the small dirt and dust are really picked up quite well, but if any of you have small children (we have 3 boys under 6), don't have any expectations of this getting up mealtime messes.Now, onto the wet vac part, which was the main reason we got this. Very disappointing. We used the included cleaner, warm tap water, etc as the directions indicated, and both my wife and I swear the floor is no cleaner than when we started. It doesn't look cleaner, shine more or even have a nice smell that we could even close our eyes and pretend it was clean. Spills or stains that normally take 1-3 passes with a mop are taking 8-12 passes with this machine. We bought this to save time and/or get cleaner floors, and I can honestly say that this machine did not do either.As briefly noted above, if you have children, do not expect clean floors out of this, and I can't recommend this at all. This product may be suitable for people who have no children, no pets and only small dust particles and light traffic; I just know this isn't our house
THESE RINGS ARE MUCH TOO BIG  AND TOO LIGHTLY MADE FOR EGG MUFFINS AND THE EGGS SPILL OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE RINGS. TOTAL JUNK. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE RING
First off, this is available at the Ewins site for $30, should you decide to plunge.The construction of the wooden parts is pretty nice, better than what you'd expect for $50, but that's about the only positive thing. The hardware is terrible and they only ship as many as you "need", so you're kind of SOL when the crappy aluminum cams break. I'm sure they'd send some more if I asked, but for now my piece is hanging out, half way assembled because I'm scared of breaking any more of the hardware. Either way, I think I'm going to ditch the cam/bolt paradigm and use wood glue and screws to finish it up.The instructions consist of an exploded diagram that looks like it was blown up from an image on the web. If you've never built flat pack furniture before you will not be able to figure it out. Even if you have, you will put something together incorrectly and have to disassemble the piece
Heavy machine, looked durable, almost commercial. Put her together and began. Within 5 MINUTES of use the belt for the rotating brush burned up and the brush no longer rotated! Returned it the following day and bought a Bissel that has worked great, was cheaper and weighs less!
This is a great idea, but I think it might need more tweaking. The reservoir holds a lot of water, which is good, but there is no filter. So any cat hair, stray food, or whatever your 18-month-old might be trying to throw will end up in the bowl. Then it sits there, usually after sinking to the bottom, until you dig it out. Also, with mine at least, you had to fiddle with it and fiddle with it to get any real bubbles to appear. A shame, since the cat really did like the few bubbles I was able to coax out. If this somehow filtered the water AND made bubbles, I'd be all over it (like cat hair on a pastel couch)
I was so excited to receive such a beautiful pan for Xmas. However, if my experience today is representative of how this pan performs, I won't be using it often.The literature which comes with the pan describes it as pre-seasoned, and the recipe included instructs for the bread to be brushed with olive oil but mentions no prep for the pan except to heat it over low to medium heat. On the first try I had some cheese burn onto the pan and the bread seemed to cling stubbornly in spots, though I was able to get it to release with a pancake turner. The scorched cheese was very difficult to scrub off, even with soaking for awhile.On the second try I oiled the pan and the press and carefully oiled the bread, so as to not have any bare spots. I still had sticking! Ditto for clean up.This thing weighs a ton, too. It is awkward to transfer off the burner; the instructions warn "lift, do not slide" on a glass top stove. I think I'll continue to use my non-stick griddle with a cast iron pan on top for a press. That always works great!
Disappointing at bestI was truly disappointed in this item. After purchasing it we followed the directions  for conditioning the non-stick grids both before using it for the first time as well as  before each use as listed in the "use and care guide."It sounds simple enough. Wait for the green indicator light to come on, add the batter close but do not latch the lid. The green light will go off, when it comes back on the waffle is ready. The only problem is the waffles were burnt and were stuck to the lid as though glued in place with epoxy glue. The waffles ripped into pieces when trying to get them loose from the maker and they also tasted like burnt toast crusts. We said  "Well, OK, maybe it just needs a couple of waffles cooked in it  before they start to come out right."  7 sheets of waffles later they were still coming out as bad as the first. The price is great, the design is nice, the over all appearances are wonderful but it simply does not work, at least not for us. I told my wife I would take it back to the store and exchange it. She said, "don't you dare bring another one of those things home with you." It's to bad too, we both love waffles. 
This red-and-white cutting board looks attractive and helps brighten up the kitchen counter.  However, it arrived warped, so that I really can only use one side (the board slides around on the counter when I flip it over)
I loved this while it worked.  This worked great for the first 2 times we used it.  After that it wouldn't work.  It has a 6 month warranty so I am in the process of getting if fixed. 
A very impressive looking oven. The temperature dial did not reflect the actual internal temperature of the oven by 50 to 75 degrees. Once I got that sorted out, the oven worked well about 20 times. Then the motor started to sputter on and off. Burning electrical odor filled the air and an arcing sound could be heard. While it worked, it worked well. I do not know if the defect is common or rare. I tested only one oven
I bought this as my second fryer. The third time I used this fryer, the oil went up and came out of the fryer then the lid wouldn't close properly and that's the end of it. Prior to buying this fryer, I had the presto fry daddy for years and it worked fine.
I purchased this high-end toaster oven because I wanted /needed a proficient smaller oven for smaller baking needs.  After 5 months of moderate usage, however, the middle knob has malfunctioned and it will no longer bake.  Other than that I was satisfied with the product.  I called their customer service and to get it repaired under warranty, will have to ship it at least 250 miles away, at my expense.  What a hassle.  I may just go buy a cheap toaster oven to replace it instead of spending the time and money on postage.  Live and learn....just because a product costs more doesn't mean it's better.
I have owned this unit for 2 years.  The water seems OK and definitely better than from the tap.  However, every 4 months or so we have to change the filter because we start to have a chlorine taste coming back.  The replacement cartridges are very expensive.  There is a little knob on the faucet that you pull to switch from tap to filter, and this knob recently has broken off.  We cannot seem to access the company's website to get a replacement part.  I am thinking to get a different water filter system altogether.  I would not buy again.  (Also, I have had lots of problems with their water bottles...leakage, breaking, etc.  I won't buy any product from this company again.
If you want your wife mad at you buy this vacumn. A total waste of money and time!!! Poor suction, air filter is clogging constantly, filthy when you have to empty it, shuts down when it picked up a small piece of paper, have to unplug for 30 minutes. They lost their marbles when they designed this vacumn!Could not even give this THING one star, it is that bad!!!
This is not the health magazine you'd expect from Martha Stewart -- it's extremely heavy on advertisements (45% at my rough count), and really cluttered, and just not "good". The recipes are interesting,  if you can find them among the aromatherapy and skin-hydration ads
I also bought this magazine sight-unseen and I wish I hadn't.  For re-decorating purposes, I found this magazine to be not useful at all.  The homes and gardens are pretty, but what they feature (furniture, wall and window coverings) just would not go with the middle-class home...way too opulent.  I was wanting more of a magazine that could give me a look that can be found in local or chain furniture stores... not that would try to make me get a one-of-a-kind table from XYZ Antique store in New York.  Also, I found this magazine text-heavy.  All in all, an OK magazine for a professional decorater maybe, but not for a average home-owner trying to redecorate
When I first heard there was an American version of L'Uomo Vouge I was really excited.  I thought "finally an American men's fashion magazine that'll be edgy, risky, creative & original!"  I couldn't have been more wrong.  This magazine is virtually indistinguishable from lackluster Men's magazines GQ, Esquire & Details.  European men's fashion magazines are works of art with cutting edge photography, bold reporting & beautiful advertising.  You won't find any of this in Men's Vouge.  The editors of this magazine have greatly insulted the intelligence of American readers.  If I could I'd give this magazine a negative 5
I've subscribed to Self on-and-off for about 15 years, but have recently been feeling like I've outgrown the magazine. The articles seem to focus on issues facing single women who are just starting their careers.  Fine, but not for me anymore!  Also, their subscription department is terrible!  My most recent subscription has been plagued with missed issues, double issues and late issues -- and a customer service department that can't quite pull themselves together.
I have been subscribing to US Weekly for about a year and a half. In that time, I have never seen an issue without several pages of Jessica Simpson. I have to wonder; does Jessica donate money to this magazine? She seems to dominate the whole magazine, each and every week. I won't be renewing my subscription. I'm tired of Jessica and the untruths that US Weekly supplies
they may have some good info, but i was flipping through this in my local bookstore, and most of what they have is a whole lotta ads... and within the ads a lot of scams and MLM schemes.buyer beware. :
Like "Where's Waldo", it seems every issue must have at least one, if not several Mies van der Rohe daybeds.  While this is admitedly a classic piece of furniture, one gets the impression that there are a gaggle of designers telling their clients, "You have to have one of these, they're what's IN!"  Most of the features in Metropolitan Home suffer from the same fate; dreary antiseptic homes with the same dreary interiors that obviously were foisted upon gullible, uninformed clients by designers who know how to make an easy buck.  "Modern" equals, of course, a Mies van der Rohe daybed (notice how many times it shows up in this review?), otherwise you get month after month of 1970's florals, faux Louis the Whatever tables.  Even using feature extraction, wading through the dreck and finding something useable for your own purposes, it's painful to look through this magazine.  If you really want ideas for making your house reflect you, trust yourself and what YOU like, and if you do like Mies van der Rohe daybeds, by all means get one.  Just don't plunk one in your sun room because you were told it's trendy. If you like the Modern style, look up the works of Hans Wegner and Peter Hvidt and go from there; their furniture still looks stylish after 50 years of hard use by real families and is sturdy as well.  Maybe you want a house where nobody is allowed to set foot in any of the rooms and amounts to a bad hodge-podge of styles that all seem a bit busy and bumpy.  For everyone else, think about the things you'd like to see if you walked into a room, save your money and skip this magazine
"Spin" is an accurate name for something like this -- a lot of hype, for an innocuous but rather tepid rock magazine. If Rolling Stone is the dirty old geezer of rock magazines, then Spin is the teenager who tries hard to convince you he's cool by name-dropping the Strokes. Spin covers some of the same turf as Rolling Stone and Blender, but less lasciviously -- lots of coverage of popular bands. Some of them are quite good -- the Hives, for example, or indie newcomer Steve Burns (who quit his job on "Blues Clues" after hearing a Flaming Lips album, and reinvented his life as a rocker). Unfortunately they overemphasize whatever bands are hot at the moment, and then overemphasize them again -- as well as tacking them up in whatever "coolest"/"best" lists they chalk up for the year/decade/century/history of rock. Indie cred is maintained by a few half-page articles on potentially hot bands like the Comas and Metric, but this info is halfhearted. It's like they're reluctant to tear themselves away from articles on better-known bands, regardless of talent. The writing, however, has that certain affliction that a lot of major rock magazines have: the Need To Be Cool. Their writers always are trying to be funny, but rarely come across that way. It seems silly and strained, like a soccer mom wearing a spandex tube dress. Even the CD reviews are mediocre. However, one recent highlight is Dave Eggers' columns -- witty, funny, and a little bit skewed. In fact, they are often the best things in the entirety of the magazine.One of the problems is the emphasis on stuff in Hollywood. Scarlett Johanssen is a wonderful actress, yes. But she doesn't sing, nor has she appeared in a music-based movie -- Jack Black yes, Scarlett no. And what is up with party coverage on TV starlet Mischa Barton and MTV couples? Check out sublimely indie mags like Chord, Filter, Under the Radar and the online Kludge for in-depth looks at some worthy bands. As for Spin? It's still trying to convince us it's cool, but Eggers is the only regularly cool thing about it
I flip through Time every now and again at the barber shop.  Sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change, people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists.  For the most part, since Time receives most of its revenues from Big Business advertisements, it can't challenge the establishment as it needs to.So instead I read magazines like Z, Utne, Mother Jones, The Progressive, The Sun, Earth Island and the New Internationalist
Anyone with a good taste in music will hate this magazine, as it only rates bad bands from bad genres good reviews and whatever good bands are listed, are often given bad reviews.  Its all pretentious pop-culture drivel for the conformist, weak-willed mainstream American.The worst part of Rolling Stone is the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All time list; as they highly rate Kirk Hammett, Kurt Cobain, and Tom Morello (all extremely overrated guitarists) while rating Eddie Van Halen at a very lowly #70 and not even mentioning these awesome guitarists; Kerry King/Jeff Hanneman (Slayer), John Petrucci (Dream Theater), Trey Azagthoth/Erik Rutan (Morbid Angel), Jeff Loomis (Nevermore), Steve Vai, and Joe Satriani.  If you know anything about good guitarists, those eight guitarists I just mentioned DESTROY Kirk, Kurt, and Tom.Don't read this if you're trying to decide what good music is, YOU decide what good music is.  Think for yourself, don't let MTV and Rolling Stone think for you
Once upon a time this was a good magazine worth reading cover to cover.  Unfortunately they've slowly been replacing content with more and more advertising.  As the magazine currently stands you could probably finish reading the actual "content" in about an hour.  The rest is advertising and BS.  This magazine jumped the shark a long long time ago.  Just let it die already like it's supposed to
i remember back in the middle '90s this magazine was think... probably anywhere between 1.5-2.5 inches... it contained Ads, reviews, supplier lists, benchmarks and sometimes trial software... Well i have picked one up sense them... and they are now a centimeter thick (if your lucky) they contain ... reviews that are well written or well read, and a whole lot of ads... my conclusion don't buy it... if you want reviews buy PC Magizine or PC World... and if you want ads... surf the internet
This is my favorite magazine in the universe and the only one to which I have ever subscribed. However, after this, my second subscription is over, I plan to call it quits. The magazine never gets delivered unless I send several angry e-mails every month reminding them and demanding delivery. When the issues come they are often 2-3 months behind. The current issue is over three weeks late and who knows when and if I will ever see it. In the end, although this is a brilliant publication, it simply isn't worth the headache. Photo, if you're out there, please forward me the June issue.... and while you're at it get a head start on July and August and maybe they'll make it on time
Ordered 11/27 - Never received a single copy.  Not very fast is it?  SLOW COMPANY may be a better description.  Can I have my money back
If I see another picture of a blurred waterfall or creek I am going to puke...I have not seen one truly imaginative, artistic image in this magazine. Everything is run of the mill, boring, standard outdoor photography.  Lots of sunsets, flower fields.  No different angles or perspectives, colors, nothing new.  The articles are geared toward inexperienced photographers and really repetitive.  I think I clipped one interesting article in a year worth of magazines..
Where Macworld is bad, Addict is dreadful. It is dumbed down to the level of Teen Beat, and the "reviews" don't deserve the name. The extent to which it drools over Apple is embarassing, leaving no pretence of independence. Like its competitor, it exploits the crummy support that typifies the computer industry, so we get articles about the "secrets" of such and such product. A "secret" in the computer industry is a feature or defect that has not been properly documented by the manufacturer. This should be blasted, not applauded. But Addict is happy to exploit readers by selling them the information they should have gotten when they purchased the product
Wired Magazine has proven to me something it had never even occurred to me to imagine: That there is a level of cynical, style-whoring, inaccurate, myopic snarkiness that goes beyond merely "trading substance for style." Wired is consistently behind the curve these days, but that doesn't stop the publication from spinning every article like a golden truth you were too lame to know. In articles about controversial subjects, one side is routinely saddled with straw man arguments that are so blatant and artless that I find them offensive even when I disagree with the parties who have been set up for a fall. Just as often, features which don't discuss a contentious topic still have an edge to them, making fun of a person, group, or idea in a way that isn't enlightening or even humorous, let alone warranted by the subject matter.Generally, Wired is as mean-spirited as it is self-congratulatory. This attitude appeals primarily to the demographic of tech wonks and IT industry tourists professionally and personally deflated by the bubble burst, desperately trying to assert their relevance and relive their high-flying, know-it-all glory. Any content is easily outweighed by the sheer volume of half-truths, shoddy reasoning, and straight-up falsehoods which could easily be revealed and corrected by a casual investigation of the subjects treated in pages choked between high gloss, Yuppie/GenXer-targeted corporate mind-poison (advertising).Isn't the world of technology interesting and magical enough without mixing the spin, double-talk, and factual misrepresentation of a presidential debate with the impotent, absurd bravado of Battle Bot pre-match trash talk? People know little enough about how tech rules the world and how it can, quite plausibly, save it. This magazine could evangelize for technology's promise and educate about its current and future potential. Instead it concentrates on one-shots written in a style that passes for "hip" that forwards an attitude rather than a message, with an emphasis on sensationalism over accuracy, having more in common with advertising than edification
This magazine recently (April 05) featured what they felt were the 100 greatest movie moments of all time.  Number 1 was the sing-along scene from MAGNOLIA.  Other moments in the top 10 included the credits from AUSTIN POWERS 3 and one of Eugene Levy's quotes from AMERICAN PIE.  Keep in mind, these are the 100 greatest movie moments of ALL TIME.This mag/rag is nothing more than the film section of FHM stretched out to full-issue length.  Utter trash
CT is quick to call the collection agency.  They require written &quot;opt-out&quot; notification from the subscriber that the subscription is to be terminated.  Beware, these guys are a credit risk.  Too much trouble for what is otherwise a good magazine
I would agree with previous reviewers, in that the burgeoning ads in this magazine over the past decade has made the magazine a chore to read.  The number of ads now easily exceed the number of pages devoted to articles.  It is also quite disturbing to note that many of those ads (possibly 50% or higher) pitch ultra high end products, such as Viking ranges, BMW's, Oceanna Cruises, trips to Bora Bora...WTF? Although I do enjoy I a luxury meal, I don't want to go into massive credit card debt purchasing products this magazine is selling.  Ocassionally, behind the clutter, I find a useful recipe; I rarely find an interesting article.I am going to let my subscription expire at the end of the current period
I like to read Cook's Illustrated at the library.  Their magazine is much too expensive for the small amount of recipes included within. I like the tips sent in by readers, and some of the product reviews.I have found that most of their recipes are very involved--nitpicky, to be kind.  The lemon meringue pie recipe--which I tried from their "America's Test Kitchen" cookbook--calls for cooking cornstarch in water, cooling it, and then beating the solution into the meringue. Supposedly this keeps the meringue from destabilizing.  All that happened in my kitchen was I found little lumps of cornstarch glue at the bottom of my mixing bowl while scraping out the meringue.  I have made meringue before without cornstarch, and can't help thinking this is an extra step that isn't neccessary. Their "best" brownies are good, but I can make equally good brownies without all the extra steps involved in melting chocolate and cooling it, etc.  If you're looking for easy, fool proof recipes, that don't take a gazillion steps and aren't fussy about exactly what ingredients you use, this isn't the magazine for you
This magazine comes with lots of advertisements - 70% or more. Plus, articles (less than 15 articles in every issue) in the magazines are not very useful.  I subscribed the magazine because it is inexpensive and it is rated high by other subscribers.  Now I realize I made a mistake. 
I dont enjoy this publication at all anymore, dont know if editorial leadership has change
This publication has no business calling itself a "magazine"; published by San Diego book distributor American Marketing Servies, this is nothing more than a fluffy info-mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo. Don't waste your money
      I was reading this magazine at work, and I consider it to be a trashy magazine. It only focuses on the sexual part of women, like if sex is the best thing in the world, because they had this article in which a girl was riding a taxi, and she thought the taxi guy was fine, so she unbutton her shirt and told the taxi guy to touch her breasts. And then she says it was the *best experience she ever had.I just cant believe they publish garbage like that, giving the message to women that its ok to undress yourself with a total stranger, who you dont even know.I prefer to read things that focus more on the inner heart, on the emotional, and spiritual side of things. And read books that will help me be a better person right now and the future, and throw away the garbage this society has
I have subscribed to this magazine for almost a year now and I have become very skeptical of much of its advice.  This advice seems to be heavily influenced by its paying advertisers e.g. the US Dairy Industry (there is always at least one of those annoying "got milk" ads) and not surprisingly, every issue there are several articles in the magazine that hype the supposed benefits of a diet high in dairy products (e.g. milk and cheese).  However having read many books on nutrition, it has become very clear to me that that the majority of current research shows that a diet high in dairy products can actually be very damaging to your health - for instance read the The China Study by Colin Campbell, an extremely comprehensive nutritional study that sheds a great deal of light on the US dairy industry and its shady methods of influencing the public's perception of the healthfulness of its products.  It is well known that there are many better ways of getting calcium etc into your diet than by dairy but this magazine is unfortunately blinded by its advertisers' paychecks.  The magazine also appears to be very similar to Prevention magazine which I also have subscribed to and I would make the same criticism of.  My advice is to stick to reliable sources on health like the excellent "Berkeley Wellness Letter" that are not supported or influenced by the advertisements of drugs companies or powerful industry groups like the US Dairy Industry
Please see tj-mccarthy's review elsewhere here; he is, to borrow a phrase from across the pond, spot-on in his comments. Just this week I cancelled my 10-year subscription to PC Magazine. One thing not mentioned elsewhere is that the new editor, Jim Louderback, has dropped the old tagline on the front cover, "An Independent Guide to Technology". I conjecture that the reason for doing so is that this magazine is no longer independent and is, in fact, just a marketing vehicle for various products. If you are like me and you do not like stealth marketing, stay away from this publication
I have been a subscriber to TIME for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents' subscription. It pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about. Frankly, the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters.A newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers--to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view. Unfortunately TIME fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story--any future coverage is designed to prove TIME's initial position correct. The immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event; stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories--"we told you so, we told you so." Even worse, the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story. Can't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn? Out of sight, out of mind is the mantra...In fact, I sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media; newspapers are failing, television news can't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic, even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance. We seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis.Neutrality is dead. Frankly, I don't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as I do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant. TIME used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the United States--no more. Iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page. African states are making vast strides towards democracy, we get an article about Nigerian computer fraud. Russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy, but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in Iraq. Japan, one of the world's most influential cultures, in the week I originally wrote this review (see 12-month subscription) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling. Somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which TIME could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership, instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of Joel Stein's puerile take on pornography and social deviants. But most damning is the fact that after reading TIME one asks: How in the hell did our world become boring?Can TIME try emulating The Economist rather than The Enquirer? Someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in-depth coverage--educate the reader about the world in which we live; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week. TIME has the history and potential of being a five-star magazine, if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news
 When you subscribe to the Wall Street Journal it's like getting two newspapers:  a good news reporting paper and an what at times seems like an editorial page written by sophmomores in the local Young Americans for Freedom college rag.  It's not that I mind right-wing editorials, I'm somewhat of a libertarian myself, it's just that its editorial page puts ideology ahead of reason far too often for my taste.  For a much better deal  -- business news, all the financial quotes, much better international coverage, and excellent and concise reporting -- choose the Financial Times.  At the moment an annual subscription is selling for $50.  It's a much better publication and on Saturday's has a very fine weekend section with good book reviews and arts and culture coverage.  Also because the FT is based out of London the editors are much more balanced and less cowed or ideologically obedient.  Even if they were similarly priced the FT would be the better deal.  As it is the FT costs a fraction of the price of the WSJ. 
I liked Time magazine a lot until they named George Bush person of the year? Oh my god, where were all the educated editors/writers when they let this moron write this article
I got this magazine for a year and a half before I had to quit my subscription recently. I liked all the fashion tips and articles on how to dress for your body size and style, and that is why I subscribed to begin with. But I was not expecting the bombardment of amoral opinions forced on me. (not to mention an overload of advertising- which you will get in most fashion magazines anyway, so that's not a complaint). Sure there was a few lines here and there that were nonbiased (telling the facts of STDs and such), but 90% of the articles on sex, were opinion and not fact. Girls today are having sex with anyone and getting hurt emotionally and physically because of magazines like Seventeen who say that sex is good if you're ready (What 15 year old girl is ready to have sex and get an STD or a baby?? Please.), and that condoms are 100% effective. They are not, but that's what most teen girls believe because of stupid magazines like this. They need to take advice from their parents and doctors, not magazine articles. I was disgusted at the opinions presented as truth to basically promote teen girls doing whatever they want without consequences.
Was very dissapponted with this magazine.  They go unread and get thrown out.  Just waiting for our subscription to run out.It is really for older kids and of very little interest to younger kids
I am also a longtime subscriber, and I am quite outraged at the new changes that have been made with the magazine. I have written a letter to the editor containing my list of grievances, if you will (I would hope they would be redressed but they will probably ignore me). Anyway, please read:I am a current subscriber, and was quite suprised by Discover's new look (to all reading this review on Amazon.com: Amazon.com does NOT display the updated version of what Discover currently looks like). I didn't quite care for it, but as long as the material stayed the same I was going to be allright with it. Unfortunately, the articles in Discover have degenerated into "Top 20 things you didn't know about..." lists, piles of trivia, some sexual humor and editorializing on recent news. Sure, reading about gay astronauts may be a little humorous. Is it appropriate for what Discover stood for or what I have expected from this magazine? I would disagree. Occasionally there is an intelligent article. The cover story still seems up to par with the stories from the Old Discover. I really did once enjoy this magazine and it was the most expected item to arrive in my mailbox. I've kept all my copies from the last five years in the best condition I possibly could because I truly did enjoy reading them, and still do. Maybe this new Discover is for a "new generation" or meant to lure in younger or less mature readers, but I think the change in articles has taken a turn for the worse. I think the ordinary person, the "lay man" if you will, would appreciate at least intelligent articles about new, interesting and groundbreaking discoveries in the scientific community. I remember the String Theory article (I forget which issue exactly) as one of the most well-written articles on that topic.It was very exciting, and most importantly it [i]got me interested in the science[/i]. I doubt I will ever see anything that good from Discover magazine again. I'd really hate to give up on this magazine: all I ask is for the old Discover back.
I haven't received this product yet and I'm pretty upset about it.I've requested that someone contact me about this problem and I haven't been given an answer.  I think I'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer. Where is the product I bought???
Simply stated,if you want a politically correct magazine that panders to the socialistic academic minority, buy the mag. I'll pass and go online to the authors ignored and enjoy reading about the real new horizons
I wish that when I purchased this subscription I would have read all of the reviews.  Unlike the description included on the Amazon website, the subsription does NOT include the CD-ROM, which costs an additional $1/issue.  And, if you want to purchase the CD-ROMs for past issues, they cost $4/disk.  Sometimes a bargain isn't really a bargain.  Buyer beware
I haven't recieved a single copy so I can't really review it. All I can say is the amazom service is terrible
I'm so glad we didn't buy a subscription to National Geographic Kids magazine without checking it out at the news stand first! It truly seemed like there were more pages of ads than of actual CONTENT in this magazine.If you're looking for a good kids' magazine about nature & wildlife, try one of the National Wildlife Federation's excellent publications. My kids enjoy Your Big Backyard (for ages 3-7) and Ranger Rick (for kids 7 & up), both of which are available through Amazon.com or [...]Kids Discover magazine (for 6-12 year olds) is another favorite with my children (and me) and contains great science & social studies articles without the commercials of NG Kids. You can subscribe through Amazon or [...
I am utterly disappointed in the direction that Gamepro has taken over the past two years. I actually stopped my subscription for about 1 year, but came back to the 20 issues for $10 at their (10?) year anniversary.  I forget.  But the magazine is really bad.One thing I laugh is, the retro corner.  They have info about issues from 5 and 10 years before, and they always announce the number of pages from 10 years ago. I think the most recent issue, they said: 140 pages?  Huh?  I think my last issue was around 100.  And don't try to tell me they've lost 40 pages in advertising. Too bad on-line reviews and websites, are taking over the subscriptions of the hardcopy magazines. I'll stick with hardcopy until the end of my life. Or until the quality of these types of magazines gets so low, I can't stand it anymore.  Or until my subscription runs out on this craptacular effort. You guys were pretty good 5 years ago, but you've gone to pot these past two years!  I'm talkin' to you Watchdawg!!!You guys are suckin' lately!!!MC White said:  You guys are suckin'!!
I'de have never read Vibe in the first place, but i won a free years subscription in some online contest.  And i must also mention i'm a huge fan of hip-hop and hip-hop culture, so i'de think Vibe would be tight.....daamn, was i ever wrong.  First off, half the mag is Advertising....then what little reading there is....it's all bullsh**.  The interviews they have with artists are totally weak & watered down.  They never ask any worthwhile questions.  Vibe also contradicts itself constantly.  In one issue, they'll give an album a low rating & a poor review, then at the end of the year they name that same album one of the years best....what the f***?  Vibe has it's decent moments, but i def. won't be paying for it anytime soon.
Sure I like a mystery- who doesn't? But when you a read a magazine like Hitchcock you end up losing faith in the short mystery story. The tales are hard-edged and lacking in style and substance. We seem to have a wealth of mystery writing talent but time and again Hitchcock Magazine is a disappointment. The value for money is horrible, the magazine is printed on newsprint paper and the ink just needs to be touched to smudge- Alfred Hitchcock would not be proud
Great for filling the doctors office magazine selection - if it's free - but not worth your money to own. I bought if for gardening inspiration and there is really nothing about gardens or gardening in here. Oh, once in a while they remember to put a garden shot in the magazine, but not consistently. The home section isn't that inspirational either. Go for it if it's free, but if it's not, don't buy it
I used to really like US magazine. I have been collecting every issue each week for several years now. But wait! Has anyone else noticed that this magazine has drastically changed since the beginning of this year? Where are all the interesting articles and info on the celebrities, movies and music? There's no more than a thumbnail's sketch of info on anything now. It's all photos and quickie hype. It has no more substance. What happened to this good magazine
This is a great magazine, but don't order it through Amazon.  They go through a third party (Snapse Magazine)that has terrible customer service.  I ordered this magazine in January and SIX months later... still no magazine.  I called Snapse twice and was told they had no record of the order (even though I received an email confirmation from Amazon and I have a 17 digit confirmation number).  They said they would research it and get back to me.  No one called or emailed me the status, so two weeks later I called them again.  They acted as if I had just placed the order and told me it takes 6 to 8 weeks to receive the first issue. I won't get my first issue until August.  Buyer beware... it could take SEVEN MONTHS before you receive your FIRST ISSUE.

I never bought GQ back in my 20s because for one thing, I never thought of myself as a clothes-horse.  Also, I actually took the G in GQ to mean that it was actually for Gentlemen, ie, sipping Champagne on a Yacht pass me the the Caviar type Gentlemen.Well, after now having reached a "certain age" I find myself going back and forth between Esquire and GQ and find that in many cases, neither are exactly right for me.  However, I think I've bought my last episode of GQ.  The 2006 "interview" with Will Ferrel was interesting for the first three paragraphs, and then it became an excercise in self referentialism, disguised as an attempt at wit. Also, the Politics of the magazine are unabashedly anti-Bush Administration, which would be OK except for the fact that I'm not reading GQ for Political content.  There are plenty of magazines out there make this their specialty, and when I find it in GQ, its just tiresome.  Frequently, swipes at Bush and his policies just come out of nowhere in an article, as if the Editor decided that a jab at Bush and his policies might help the piece, regardless of its content.Not to mention - does anyone actually wear the clothing they put on display?  $800 tennis shoes?  I fear that I will be an Esquire reader - I can't bear to become a "Men's Best Life" subscriber just yet
If you want to do the same exercise over and over.. but with better make up and cuter outfit go ahead.If you want better exercises and articles look to Oxygen or Women's M&
I ordered Kiplingers and US News on March 25 and was immediately charged for both subscriptions.  Today is October 12th and I've never received US News.  I've complained several times and been given a variety of excuses and promised a refund and free subsciption which of course I haven't received.  When I requested a refund of course I was given the wrong amount.  If you want to order magazines I agree with the last reviewer go to another site because while Amazon is great for books that haven't got the magazine business straight.  Also, the customer service phone numbers are wrong and this is a total mess.
Please read Naomi Jakobs' review for Relevant Magazine below. It captures so brilliantly and eloquently the heart of the Christian 'post-modern' kick. If you have to go out of your way to claim you're a celebrity, then you simply aren't a celebrity (Take "Fitness Celebrity" John Basedow for example). In the same way, if you have go out of your way to claim that the Post-modern Evangelical movement is relevant, then you're claim for relevancy is simply not credible. The Christian church has certainly played a vastly significant role in the past 2000 years. However pop-culturalizing Evangelical Christianity isn't causing it to be any more relevant than it was when Sandi Patty or Carmen ruled the Christian top 40. Does the fact that some Christians enjoy the latest musical fads make the concept of accepting a human blood-sacrifice for the pardon of sins more palatable
Back in the 1970's my grandmother subscribed to Prevention. At that time, it was a wonderful magazine, filled with informative articles aimed at the "Prevention" of illness and the promotion of wellness (as the founder of Prevention, J.I. Rodale had preached). Articles about the role of vitamins and nutrition were light years ahead of their time. (J.I. can be given a lot of credit for bringing vitamins and supplements to the mainstream). Over the years, and especially after the tragic death of Robert Rodale (J.I.'s son), and the takeover by his wife and daughter, it has unfortunately transformed into a fluffy, tabloid-like "women's magazine" with scantily clad women on the covers, and one- or two-page articles instructing women to get killer abs and burn the fat. I think J.I. Rodale is probably spinning in his grave to see what his descendents have done to butcher this magazine, which bears NO resemblence whatsoever to what it used to be. I flipped through a copy in disgust recently to note, as another reviewer has stated, plenty of ads for DRUGS which really seems to go against the idea of preventing illness in the first place (whereas the old Prevention sang the praises of vitamins and health foods). I don't know why the Rodale family doesn't just scrap the title and call it something else, but alas, they are a major corporation now and I have little hope that this magazine will improve any time soon
This magazine is chock full of supplement advertisements.  Advertisements in fashion magazines are annoying, but supplements can be unhealthy and dangerous.  These ads may have something to do with the target audience of the magazine...  It seems to be directed to women who are hard core about weightlifting and fitness, to the level of competition.  A recent article in the magazine was talking about what percentage of body fat was too low for women.  Some of the women had body fat below 10% - I'm trying to get mine below 30%.  It's just a different fitness/weightloss league completely.I like magazines like Fitness and Shape better because it sets more reasonable goals and provides more reasonable advice.  I can substitute toast with jam for bagels with cream cheese.  I can't drink protein shakes for breakfast and lunch, eat 10 servings of protein a day, and pop potentially dangerous pills.  I am very disappointed with this magazine..
This was kind of an impulse buy for me and I didn't get what I thought I would get. I thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in TV and the Movies. Instead I got indepth ramblings on actors and directors. If you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler...this is not the mag for you.
This magazine fell apart so quick. They are no longer a unbias magazine. Instead they are a Interscope propaganda machine. Just look at the covers? Every year Shady/G-Unit gets a automatic 8 covers. Every album from that camp gets automatic XXL and XL ratings. Even the horrible Tony Yayo album got a XL maybe the most disgraful rating I've ever seen in hip hop. As a hip hop reader I can never take anything they write serious because they are tainted and corrupt. I suggest you search else where if you want a good hip hop mag
When I first heard there was an American version of L'Uomo Vouge I was really excited.  I thought "finally an American men's fashion magazine that'll be edgy, risky, creative & original!"  I couldn't have been more wrong.  This magazine is virtually indistinguishable from lackluster Men's magazines GQ, Esquire & Details.  European men's fashion magazines are works of art with cutting edge photography, bold reporting & beautiful advertising.  You won't find any of this in Men's Vouge.  The editors of this magazine have greatly insulted the intelligence of American readers.  If I could I'd give this magazine a negative 5
I have subscribed to Discover magazine for years but have recently cancelled my subscription.  The magazine, which once served up well written news of present and future science has become a hack rag.  From juvenile sexual humor and associated photos couched under the guise of science to supposed factual articles that seem ripped from my local papers Op-Ed page, the whole magazine has degraded into a worthless pile of trash
I was ecstatic when I received this magazine subscription as as gift. Two issues into my subscription it stopped. I was really anticipating the December issue because I had many guests coming and could use some of Martha's helpful advice, however it never came and neither did January or February. I have called Martha Stewart Living magazine twice and while they are very nice and apologetic, I still have not received another issue. When I asked to cancel for a refund I was given a phone number with an automated system that uses a credit card account look up - being that it was a gift this is useless. Very clever for Martha and very frustrating for the giftee/consumer
I wanted more recipes and this magazine has too much other junk in it.  Will not renew, not what I wanted
 To be honest, I do pick up this Mag from the Newstand 4 to 5 times a year, but I can hardly call myself a fan. If you are looking for a solid computer or tech mag, Wired is not for you, It tries too hard to be hip and trendy, but it's group of Left/Lib Nerds too often come off as being lame and borish.  Wired needs to be "ReWired" to meet the needs of the modern tech community
Order placed early June. First issue of subscription not yet received. This is service
I am completely frustrated and upset with the delivery, or lack thereof, of the magazine subscription I received as a gift of Romantic Homes.  This is my absolute favorite magazine and my husband purchased a year's subcription for me from Amazon.com for Christmas 2005!  I still haven't received ONE magazine (it's now July 2006).  Amazon assured me three times, over the past year, it was coming, it's now July and I still haven't received the magazine.  I am so disappointed at the lack of customer service.  I urge you to NEVER buy a magazine subscription from Amazon.com.  This has been a horrible experience and I cannot believe that it has somehow become okay to run a business in this matter.  I am tired of empty promises from Amazon.com while I am anxiously awaiting my magazine.  Not only have I not received my magazine, the "people" at Amazon have NEVER offered a refund, a renewed subscription, ANYTHING!  I realize it's a measly twenty-something dollars, but this business practice is horrible!  I am also tired of speaking to people that do not speak English and are trying to help me.  Please do better Amazon, this is terrible!  Shame on you! 
This magazine shows the negative side of black men. I find the magazine an embarrasement to the African-American community. It seems out of all the races of men in the world, black men seem to want to display their lack of self control, their love of  fancy cars, overpriced clothes, which in no way helps create wealth in our communities. And I am also offended that this magazine rarely shows black women on the front cover. Until, black men understand that this kind of pathetic display of supposed masculinity is stopped, they will always be stopped by the police, be passed over for employment, and looked down upon. I wish someone would create a magazine for black men which shows the positive side of being a black man such as being leaders in their community, showing respect and love for their women, and showing that everything is not hip hip!
This publication has no business calling itself a "magazine"; published by San Diego book distributor American Marketing Servies, this is nothing more than a fluffy info-mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo. Don't waste your money
I received this subscription as a trial, and found it one of the most boring publications that I have ever read.  By the last few issues that I got, I wasn't even looking at the pictures anymore.  There are drawn-out descriptions of their views of the finer things in life, which were very materialistic.  At the end of every issue there were pictures of &quot;real-life&quot; wedding announcements.  Perhaps this is fitting for your local newspaper, but it struck me as out of place in a magazine
If you're a teenage guitarist and want to learn Nickelback, Green Day, and nu-metal songs, then this magazine is for you. There's also some pretty good tips for beginners from time to time. But in the last several years the quality of the feature articles and interviews has gone steadily downhill, and there are far too many ads. As many people have said, sometimes it doesn't seem to be geared towards musicians at all anymore. The smarmy, "hipper than thou" Rolling Stone, Spin, Pitchfork Media style of writing seems to be taking over the mag.  And other styles of music such as blues, country, jazz, etc, are pretty much ignored.  But like I said, if you're a teenager and you see it on the newsstand and there's a song in it you would like to learn, pick it up, otherwise avoid this magazine
I bought the magazin on november, and I don't recive it yet
This magazine should be free, since there are so many advertisements.  Also, it is strictly modern decorating, unlike the editor's claims.  If you like extreme, modern style, try it out; otherwise invest in something else
The title speaks for itself. I don't know how or why I was drawn to this magazine when I was 14. This magazine should be called J-4tweens. Ah. The title is very annoying. Like Twist, I only get this magazine when I'm really really desperate for something to read. I sure as hell wouldn't want my 12 year old daughter to wear mascara. If you have a tween and you want her to grow to become a pimpstress, get this. The only entertaining aspect of this magazine is the embarassing moments kinds of things (but of course). Other than that, no. They feature pretty bland fashion.All in all, this magazine is JUST like Twist.Therefore, the age reccomendation is just 11 & 12, but you're better off getting GL for even more years worth of goodness (10-15 yrs.) because no, it's NOT cool to steal your sister's damn boyfriend for pete's sake
I haven't recieved a single copy so I can't really review it. All I can say is the amazom service is terrible
dO not order MENtle floss Magazin.  it preetends to be sMart but It's just a teaz.  Covers intersting toppics, aks good qestions but the ansers are lackng.  Each issu has half a page of corections frm the preevius issu.  whats the point of reeding a mag whitch promises to mak you smarter if its not so clevver itself?  Like ths revue, it dosn't live upto it's claims. 
2 months after ordering, i have year to get my first issue.  i'm sure i'll like it...if i ever get it
The thing I hate about this magazine is the letters to the editor section. Supposedly, they're written by real people. But after reading this magazine for the last few years, these letters all seem to have the same maudlin, soporific, sappy style of prose that reads to me like they've been EDITED that way. There's this condescending "athletes are supposed to behave like GOOD ladies and gentlemen and if they don't, then tsk tsk - WHAT WILL THE CHILDREN THINK?" mentality that I absolutely HATE. The good things about SI are the photography and whatever articles on the NBA they have any given week. And the swimsuit issue? I guess if you're a 13-14 year old it's exciting as all get out - I'll take the HARD STUFF any day over their annual fleshfest
This magazine used to be THICK, fun to read, full of information. But that was about 5 years ago. Now it's just a flimsy looking mag filled with vulgarities and non-sense. The editorial is almost always filled with political opinions. I won't renew my subscription
I remember, not quite four years ago, when this magazine actually had PC substance and catered to a sophisticated PC-oriented market. Now, it's thin, hollow, interminably off-topic and ad-choked. 
My mom was a subscriber to Newsweek for years, and I'd flip through her copies.  Most of the material is friendly towards the powers that be (although, not friendly enough according to the review by the soldier who thinks the editors should be in jail.  So much for "protecting our freedoms").  Anyway, since Newsweek is beholden to Big Business advertisements, it won't do much to rock the boat that our corporate mafia owns.If people are interested in more honest, more critical views of the political and economic system that is causing so much devastation in the world (the neoliberalism of the US empire and other wealthy nations), then I'd recommend Z magazine.  I'll never forget finding my mom on the floor devouring it's articles on a range of issues the corporate media marginalize.  Z also publishes articles and interviews with the most-cited living author on the planet, Noam Chomsky (another figure I'm sure the US soldier thinks should be in jail.  Although, Chomsky recently spoke at West Point.  So, even the military is waking up to the hard truths he brings).
This is definitely the inferior rag of the big Trio of Science monthlies. Filled with poorly-written articles. I actually went back to Home Depot once to get a refund for this magazine. It is indeed worth the gas and time to get a refund if you actually pay for this magazine. This magazine promotes commercial products, and no I'm not talking about the advertisements, but the actual articles themselves. The magazine is not a news magazine, it is just one big advertising rag where manufacturers have paid to get in. If you like paying for ads, go for it
Why? Because it underestimates our intelligence! It has nothing to do with natural health. It has to do with advertisements. It is empty, completelly. More: it looks like a woman magazine but I believe that a clever woman would feel like I feel now, angry! I paid for something that I believed but it is not. OK, we make mistakes
This magazine is just one more reason why women think that men are immature, stupid, and boring.  The magazine does nothing but highlight and impress upon the superficial tendancies of men and in its so-called news coverage gives short details of events and people that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of good taste.  Don't bother
I started reciving Vibe magazine in the mail announced and unexpected. This wouldn't be the first time this happened, turns out my Grandmother bought me People magazine as a gift and the copies were sent to my house. I figured that somebody had got me this magazine as a gift. Next thing I know a charge for the magazine appears on my bank statement.I called Vibe immediately and asked them what had happened. They told me that there was nothing they could do and that their company didn't directly deal with the payment issues and subscription services. They gave me a toll free number that I was too call from an outside company that handled the payments. When I called this company, it was completely automated service, could not speak with an actual person regardless of what extension I used.I eventually had to go down to my bank and find out what I could do. Turns out Vibe had illegally gained my bank account number and had been charging me for months, but I had only just recently started to recieve the magazine. I had to close down my checking account and open up a new one, which resulted in me being charged by my gym and other other companies that had access to my account in order to subtract monthly bills. It was as if I had written them a bad check, something that I had never done in my life and now greatly questioned my credibility.Please do not support these people, they are theives and on top of that the magazine is terrible and uncredible. I seriously hope that my review will help deter any and all people from subscribing to this magazine
As a professional photographer, I think the organization that publishers this magazine has truly lost their way.  The images are predictable and unimaginative and haven't changed in the past 25 years.  There are much better magazines to read
Once thought of as a women's health magazine, Cosmo has taken a twisted turn into pointless redundancy. At one point, Cosmo seemed to be a must-have, along with water and oxygen.More and more lately, it seems that the magazine is posing the question "how can we survive on ONLY water and oxygen, and still be sexy while we do?" Ocassionally, a featured article faces the issues of things ranging from eating disorders to politics, but few and far between.They don't seem to realize that on the other side of the page for the eating disorder article, is a woman who wears a size 0 and is still unsatisfied with herself, thinking that she must conform to some "heroin-chic" fad.Fun Fearless Female - articles about real women who make a real difference - is great. It shines the spotlight on someone who not only is beautiful and successful, but has enough education and talent to succeed in the world, without needing a man. If the magazine featured more of these things, maybe it would be worth my subscription fee.But tell me when the last time is that you saw a cover NOT featuring the phrases "mind-blowing sex", "how to satisfy (insert breathing life form here)", or "barely-there", which seems to refer to not just underwear anymore, but EVERYTHING.This isn't a magazine about women's health anymore. It's all about how to keep your man happy, while still conforming to social standards in fashion, weight, and financial standings. I'm sorry, but the "girl on a budget" can't afford a $430 skirt, or uncomfortable shoes with the uncomfortable price of $300+.Cater more to the real woman; not the one who only cares about her relationship status, pant size, and bank account
I do not who to contact on this problem but I have as of yet to recieve a magazine yet. I kow it is to take awhile but i have recieved other order of a  different magazine I placed
It takes too much time to receive the first book.I haven't received the first book yet
Calling all Brighton Mums!  This magazine presents a relatively contrived viewpoint on contemporary interior design, smothered in advertising for crisp, white bed linen and pressed quartz bench tops.  A pretty lousy effort as Australia's top selling interior design magazine.  Though designed for the wealthy mainstream Brighton market, Vogue Interiors will satisfy anyone who doesn't quite know what the colour brown will &quot;work&quot; with.   VI's current editor is David Clark, Art Director is Anna Utzon and Interior Design Editor is Matt Page
Unfortunately, I have not received the item.  It's been 4.5 weeks since I placed the order.  I am reviewing this a low star, it should not take this long to receive a magazine subscription
We've never received this magazine, but we just received the bill with a message that we are about to be turned over to a collection agency.BEWARE OF THIS COMPAN
I have read Bird Times many times.  The articles are much less complicated than the Bird Talk magazine articles, which are fairly simplistic as well.  I recommend that you look at the cover and see if there are any articles that you want to read.  This magazine usually takes me 15-20 minutes to read, and that is if there is an interesting article.  Fewer ads than Bird Talk
On the whole, Bicycling is a huge disappointment. I agree with some writers that the occassional tidbits of information are good, but I don't pay for a subscription for a sidebar or two -- I read those in the newstand. Further, as I will mention below, once and a while there is a real gem of an article.In the meantime, almost everything else they do is poor. The entire magazine is pitched at the readership as though we were all budding pros, training obsessively and fighting with that last 1% of body fat. The reality is, what Bicycling's readership principally is is rich -- in their own pages, they recently listed average household income of a subscription at $115,000. So it's not people with the ability tor ride like the pros ride, it's people with the ability to buy what the pros ride.The result is a majority of articles and reviews that focus on just this -- $3000+ bikes (and, as one reviewer said, the occassional review of more reasonably priced choices around $1500. Wait, $1500 is *not* chump change?!?!), advanced training and eating techniques, etc., as opposed to real world riding -- centuries and club rides, touring, commuting (gasp!), etc. Even it's racing coverage is terrible -- its recent spread on the San Fran GP, one of the three most important races in the US, was 6 pages of photos, 4 of which were of people watching the race, not the racing itself.For me, though, the worst part is its hypocrisy. In a recent issue, there was a truly excellent article on what the author called "Invisible Riders" -- low income laborers who depended on their cheap bicycles to get them to and from work sites everyday. Yet: the author mentioned several times (albeit with embarrassment) that he was riding a Seven while doing research on people whose lives depended on $100 bikes; the author commented on the significance of these riders commuting everyday, a movement which riders like Bicycling readers had never been able to mobilize (maybe because they all drive to work and the magazine does little or nothing to encourage bicycle commuting); and the five bikes reviewed in that issue ranged from $3500-$7000.Really, really sad. One star for "Invisible Riders" and the like, and that's it
DO NOT order.  They only placed an order for 7 months but I got billed for 12.  After 3 hours on the phone they said that 7 months was all the publisher had available and they cannnot extend it.  After pitching a fit they offerred to give me a partial refund but cannot extend the subscription.  Only order from the magazine itself
I use to buy this magazine every mouth when I was much younger which was just a big waste of money all the stories and pictures can be found in any other teen bop magazine. This magazine is not for people who can actually read or understand any of the stories
but if they don't send you the magazine, then there are no way that you can contact the publisher about it.I didn't get the magazine after about first four issues.First, I didn't notice that I wasn't receiving my issues, but after three months, I found out and tried to contact the publisher about it.They don't have e-mail to contact them, but only automated phone number.If you call there and waste about 5 minutes to reach section "I didn't get my last issue", then you get about $.60 refund. No further explanation or guaranty my next issues.and I'm still not getting any issues. If you go to ripoff website, you can find the publisher was registered as ripoff company
I paid too much from Amazon.  The subscription would be significantly less expensive straight from the magazine.  I learned my lesson
I bought the magazin on november, and I don't recive it yet
amazon sells a one year subscription for $14 which includes a $5 amazon certificate that you get later.in the actual magazine, the subscription card is 6.99 for one year or 2 years for $10.00so use the card, save some money and also dont have to wait for your $5 back and then find something at amazon that you can use the $5 certificate on.
Placed subscription order on 6/29.  It's 8/16 today and I have yet to get my first issue.  :
I am 14. I used to read this about two and a half years ago. It was a pretty good magazine back then, with health tips, some real life stories, and even things like sex questions (which is saying alot more than some of these other magazines.) It wasn't packed full of teenyboppers and cheesy glitter makeup. I liked it, and if it was still the way it was, I'd probably still be reading it. But now, it's gone. I read my last issue one year ago and gave it up. It got way to young for me. All they talk about is celebrities (aka JoJo, Good Charlotte, Hilary Duff, Jesse McCartney, Usher, etc.) Alright, two of them make some passable music, but what about the others? They're talentless! Plus, I do not see anything that would appeal to anyone over the age of 13. They refer to guys as "hotties" and "babes," and they just put the same person on every five pages! There are stupid quizzes to tell you your kissing type or how psychic you are (seriously.) Half the magazine is huge posters for your room of airbrushed teeneyboppers. If you want a magazine with real substance, try Seventeen (highly reccomended), CosmoGirl, Teen Vogue, and maybe Teen People (I don't know, it's kind of lost its fun factor.) Some of these magazines may not be "appropriate" to the people that read this magazine, but I personally think it is better for young girls to learn the hard honest truth about the world than to be obsessed with pop stars and the latest Mary-Kate and Ashley gossip.
Trashy magazine, it only focuses on sex. Like ifsex is going to solve your emotional problems.This culture is so obssesed with sex.If you really want to read about relationships,I recommend "save your marriage before it starts"it gives you real info from two psychologist whymarriage is going downhill and how you can save it
I got this light before the LED lights started coming out in the retail channel.  Those lights tend to almost be too bright, but they have the advantage of running for ages on tiny batteries.  Unfortunately, this light uses 4 AA batteries which makes it fairly hefty.  It alternatively can operate on an AC adapter.  This makes it lighter, but it's still bulky because of the battery compartment.The Good:The light is nicely bright with a natural quality that's easy on the eyes.It has a ratcheting arm so you can put it where you want and it stays there (better than most of the flexible arm ones)Includes an AC adapter slot (though no AC adapter)Can help weigh down lighter books to keep the pages from turningNice large clamp for attaching to books.Lamp shade which allows you to throw the light where you want without blinding your vision.Decent quality plastic - Made in ChinaThe Bad:No brightness adjustment.Heavy (can be a benefit in some cases) and makes holding up a book all the more tiring.Bulky - Makes it really hard for a book to sit properly in your hand.The ratcheting mades a loud click which can wake your wife in bed.  :-)The clip has very limited strength and seems to slip easily.Eats up batteries fairly quickly - I use rechargeables in it now.I'm giving it an even 2 because it's a pain to use, really.  Hopefully I can find a light weight LED clip-on which has a brightness adjustment with a quiet arm that stays in place and most importantly - natural lighting.  If so, I'll review it on here - but most LEDs wash out the page making it hard to read.  The nice quality lamp is the only reason this one doesn't get 1.5 stars
I bought this item for my son's piano practice. It worked ok in terms of sound and speed, until the second day when the on/off switch broke off. Then I noticed that the plastic attachment the switch had was very thin to start with. In my opinion, this is a flaky product since the on/off switch will be used many times every day and so it has to be sturdy. 
The string screws are very loose and the strings won't stay tight. Though I know it is only a kid's guitar, it is pretty useless because the strings won't stay on. We bought two and both are the same way. Stay away from this
lousiest 10 dollars i spent. the tips are already bent and thats at maybe 10 minutes or so of fooling around with it. ive tried it with multiple guitars and the effects and theres no such thing as this thing getting a "bow" effect. i dunno. scratchy. i dont recommend this at all. ive been playing the guitar for about 13 years now.
I bought three of these for my two 6 year olds and my 7 year old.  Every one of them arrived in abysmal condition.  Strings everywhere... loose tuning screws that could not be tightened... and scratches.  I could not believe that anyone would sell something this inferior.  Shocking is an understatement describing this purchase
this industry is "goin down"  u call this an album???  LO
Listening to the Standards being sung by Rod Stewart is like listening to Classical Music being played on a kazoo! If you're new to this music, try out some Sinatra CD's. He's the guy who sets the standard when it comes to singing the Standards
Sounds like the background music used in the 70's Rockford Files TV crime show...and a little like the CHIPS music too. Similar to music by Tom Scott from back then. The crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky, they are more smooth groovin funk. The sound for the times is very clean, too produced for true funkyness. Don't get me wrong I like the old 60's JAZZ crusaders, just not this 70's phase of their career...they sold out to a large extent, and continue to do so, it's where the money is.  No improvisatory feel either. This is for smooth jazz lovers. hard funk lovers will be disappointed, as will true jazzers.  I wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops from the 60's but they keep burying it like it never happened, even to this day, afraid to lose sales if they get too musically adverturous like their mid/late 60's true jazz albums. Their 70's albums like this are partly to blame for today's smooth jazz... in other words, not really jazz, not really funky, just kind of smooth groovin, more for casual adults and offices. not challenging, not offensive, formulated to an extent. But hey if you like this, that's cool, just dont think it's real jazz, or real funk. It's smooth and casual, slightly simmers, pleasant background music, but doesn't COOK like so many other groups from the same time period that mixed jazz, funk, and fusion. It just sounds like they are holding back...I know they can play more advanced, and write more creatively, they just choose not to ever since the 60's
Mcmurtrys new album really disappoints.  I am a longtime fan and found the subject matter of the new album slipping out of character with James past work (as well as somewhat inappropriate and overly cynical).  While Mcmurtry has had past hits that either hearken back to childhood extravaganza (See the Elephant) or that provide an echo to the way we Americans spend our time (Holiday), his attempts on Childish things came across as an unfortunate mix of trite and depressing.  In past attempts Mcmurtry was able to find the nuances of the positive and the negative of Americana, yet all the remains in the stinging lyrics of this album is the over-used and overheard downside. The thoughtfulness evaporated on this work. Like many aging musicians, Mcmurtry could not resist the tempation to jump into personal politics to replace the vacuum of meaningful verse.  The cliche and empty "We Cant Make It Here" is a meaningless mix of 70s era socialism and the ills of modern era entitlement policies that displays an ignorance of both democracy and personal responsibility.  Mcmurtry, previously able to frame an issue, seems oblivious that those of different political persuasions could easily fit the same song title to a wholly opposed set of social ills.   Criticism is not intelligence, and we can only hope that Mcmurtry can get on track going forward.  Perhaps he should shun the  "PC Crowd" and seek his own space and more thoughtful views of the complex but substantial American Scene for his next album
I first became a fan of the Gorillaz with their excellent 2nd CD, Demon Days. The interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so "out there" that when you first hear one of their CD's...it sounds like complete garbage. But once you listen again and again, you start to like it more and more. Eventually you end up really liking the CD. That was the case with Demon Days. After enjoying that CD fully, I thought I should check out the first Gorillaz CD, and  I didn't like it all that much. There just seems to be very little actual songs on the CD. Way too much of it sounds like complete filler. There were a couple throwaway songs on Demon Days, but most of the stuff on that CD was great. Here, we've got songs that are just...boring. Nothing happens. I was waiting for the melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs, but it never happens. You just listen to 2-D whining into the microphone with dull beats in the background. (Such as on songs like New Genious, Man Research, and Starshine.) Some songs are nothing but beats with no lyrics at all, sometimes sounding just like static noise. Songs like this, such as Double Bass, are cool for a minute or two, but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes. It gets boring. Other songs, like 5/4, M1 A1, and Rock the House are catchy at first, but just don't have staying power. They get old. 5/4 got annoying quickly, M1 A1 and Punk lost their appeal quickly, and Rock the House is another song that would have been better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it. And songs like Latin Simone are just annoying. The remixes of 19-2000 and Clint Eastwood that end the CD are also fairly forgettable, although 19-2000's kind of catchy on the first couple listens. There are some good songs here, though. Tomorrow Comes Today, Clint Eastwood, Gravity, 19-2000, and Left Hand Suzuki Method are cool songs. Slow Country's kind of cool, too. And Dracula's got an awesome, almost haunting sound to it, and it's really absorbing. Although it too, unfortuantely, loses its tune and turns to repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it. This small collection of good songs, though, is surrounded by a huge collection of filler tracks. Much of this CD just isn't really that good.I don't know...this CD just seemed empty. Very few meaningful tracks, lots of filler, and some really annoying and repetitive songs. Some good songs were stretched to almost 5-minutes long, mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the songs. Clocking in at 72 minutes, (which makes it 22 minutes(!)longer than Demon Days) this CD was loaded with filler and just not enough good stuff. People interested in The Gorillaz should pick up their superior follow-up, Demon Days, instead of this one. If I listened to this debut CD first, I probably wouldn't have ended up liking this band very much. The good news about this is that the Gorillaz have not hit a sophmore slump; their CDs are getting better, not worse. That is a great sign for the future of this awesome band.
This one is for you.  But honestly now, the guy doesn't write--beautiful voice--but songwriting is a major appeal.  So  guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above Justin Timberlake.  Ok, there are definitely highlihgts like a Heart in Newyork, (what a) wonderful world, but generally this a very casual compilation, good for a couple listens.  in general, Art Garfunkel isn't really good for more than that.  Check out him witht Paul Simon, that is amazing stuff, but this is kinda boring.  I might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs--but even though there are good songwriters writing for him, the songs are still sub-par
As if the song for mesmerize was'nt bad enough. A F***'IN GREASE VIDEO???!!!! Ja officially became a diva with this album. This album is horrible. The pledge had some life due to Nas appearance, thats why it's hard for me to request a zero star rating. Bottomline if Ja's body was made up of his albums, this part would gangrene, maggots would avoid this and you should too
This was not as good as I had hoped and half of it is too slow to listen to while I am working out but the rest is good.
No need to say more, these f@gs are just making lousy punk pop for the teenage girls and mtv watching kids who think they're quite rebel with listening to this kind of sheit, and these suckers do it just for the money like green day or blink 182. There just have to be some stuff like this to fill all the pop and mtv charts
The Kidz Bop series is the ultimate travesty in music. And don't think that it's good just because your kids might love it. Kids also like to eat McDonalds, but don't try telling me that their food is healthy. There is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children. And, surprisingly, a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children, even with the expletives deleted. There is no reason on earth why these records should exist, excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish. I agree with the person who suggested the Beatles as an alternative. Seriously, don't buy this!
Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original.Spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? 		C    Tom Rya
and he's a super-talented drummer. The day the Foos release a best-of compilation I'll probably pick it up. Otherwise, I'm sad to say that the average Foo Fighters album cut just doesn't cut it for me. All of the songs on THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE are mediocre, run-of-the mill "alternative" rock. Only "Stacked Actors" has some real songwriting substance and it does have some swagger and bite, but to be perfectly honest, it still isn't a huge turn-on in my book. "Learn to Fly," the other track that got some airplay on alt-rock radio, may as well have been written by The Outfield or some other average rock band along those lines. I almost gave this album two stars, but unfortunately I think that rating would be just too generous.Foo Fighters HAVE made some really good songs, like "Everlong." But I honestly don't think they'd be nearly as big if Grohl hadn't drummed for one of the most highly revered and charismatic bands of all time, NIRVANA. Elsewhere, their fantastic cover versions such as Gary Numan's "Down in the Park" and Prince's "Darling Nikki" suggest they are great rockers but less great in the songwriting department
Back 2 Da Basics *1/2 StarsYo Gotti has made some decent albums, but this one is just so ridiculous and silly that it made me sick, gotti who thinks he put memphis on the map, has some good songs here and there, but the rest are just ridiculous, obnioxus and real pretentious.This is not a good albumThumbs Down
The lack of someone lurking behind Prince's shoulder while in the recording studio and having the courage to tell him when he produces second rate nonsense has been missing since the departure of the Fargnoli management team. This is a poor track incorporating biblical references that have little relevance or sense of genuine compassion to the katrina disaster. Musically the lack of emotion conveyed by the unnecessarily complicated chord changes and irrelevant reference to Sade also make the feel of this track disjointed. While Prince fans will generally hype this track, the reality is that "4 the tears in your eyes" this isn't and to add a charity track with an instrumental showing off your musical skills is just pure self indulgence and frankly crass. Lets hope this is not an indication of the upcoming 3121.  
Can we say, "money making ploy?"  WoW.  I, like many others, have grown up with Disney.  Perhaps I simply do not understand why kids of any age would listen to this garbage as opposed to the actual movie songs?  This is not like "Kidz Bop" or anything related to that which "kidifies" music - these are timeless movie classics that did NOT need to be redone - and as a further insult, they are poorly redone.  I am very, very let down by these "Disneymania" albums. :o(
After reading so many positive reviews, I was very exited when I recieved this cd in the mail. I popped it in my bose wave radio, turned it up to 85, and listened to the most annoying hissing sound I've ever heard coming from my system. I regret purchasing this cd
I like funny rappers who have some talent at least. I do not think that his songs or the man is funny at all. And even the people that I know that enjoyed this the first couple times say that they don't like it at all by the third time. Truly bad pointless music that makes all rap music seem like a joke. Avoid this one
How can ANYONE say this chick has talent?!!! My God, she is sooooooooo bad. And yes, I actually listened to it. The only reason it sounds semi ok is because she's got millions backing her and that much technology could even make me sound good! She doesn't write any of her songs and she can't hold a tune. Gives Celine a run for her money? Please!!!! The only singer she sounds better than is Paris Hilton! But whatever. If you like it, that's all that matters. If you like pretty young pop stars, Christina Aguilera is MUCH better. She can actually SING!!
Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... "LMN"(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.Track 5 - Ugh.Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, "As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word "radio" and we'll double what we're giving you." Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.Flame away, kiddies.
I'm surprised this show got past Season 1. Honestly, more talent can be found in my local karaoke bar. This show does NOT discover talent, they produce and market it. It is really demeaning to musicians everywhere. The judges are a joke, I guess the producers tell them what to say. Simon "the jerk" Cowell tries hard to be rude to everyone, hey...he has made a living out of it. Randy Jackson's vocab is limited to "yo", "yeah" and "dawg". Paula, who's the only one who I think deserves to even comment on the singers..unfortunately praises everyone, be it for their performance/energy/character/looks/(fill with any word of your choice). All in all, a total disaster...only in shows this sh*tty, can no-talents like William Hung be hailed as a celebrity. I am shocked people other than the families of those participating would actually spend time and money voting for these posers. On a more positive note, it's good that people don't actually buy the albums, thus resulting in total disappearing acts from Idol winners like Ruben and Fantasia...now we just need the American public to stop tuning in to the shows. Well, hope is all we have, right
Generally harmless, except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents.  The song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated, cynical adults.  But the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old.  I wouldn't bring this CD into your house
After hearing "I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)" I don't know why anyone would want to buy and listen to this CD in its entirety. I'm not going to type a bunch of long paragraphs about why this CD sucks. This CD is a waste and T-Pain is illiterate. There! I said it in one sentence. Holllaaa
Maybe its just me but the piano is out of tune badly enough that it should not have been recorded. I had to force myself to finish listening to the concerto and did not even bother with the rest. Sad piece of work
Do you know why this double CD is often in the bargain basement?  SImply because it is an inferior product.  For some very odd reason, the compiler at the record company decided to put 13 live songs instead of the studio versions that we all remember.  For all we know, it may have been a copyright problem. I bought this for my Dad about 5 years ago, but we were both unaware of the live recordings until we played it. The live recordings on this CD are dismal and not related to the awesome "Hot August Night". Fortunately for me,  I own the right Neil Diamond CD's which contain the studio versions.  These are still available . The first is called "12 Greatest Hits" (A black and white photo a young Neil), and the second is called "12 Greatest Hits Volume 2" (a colour photo of Neil sitting on a sofa).  Both of these contain all the studio versions - and not one live recording in sight!!!  Just released is a new compilation called Neil Diamond GOLD, as part of the GOLD series but I do not know if it too contains the dreadful live recordings. All I know is that it is missing a lot of key tracks
If you are looking for boring, lifeless adult contemporary music, then this CD is for you.  If you are looking for a great guitar CD, this isn't it.  I had such high hopes for this CD after the Robert Johnson CDs and the Cream reunion, but all winning streaks must come to an end, and Clapton's comes to a screeching halt with this.  Of all the Eric Clapton CDs that I like, this isn't one of them.  I'm glad Clapton is now in a happy place (and deservedly so), but this CD just doesn't do it for me
Understand, I love Springsteen.  Born to Run is my second favorite album of all time.  I have seen him live over a dozen times.  I personally think he is the single most important American rock and roll artist ever (with apologies to Elvis, Chuck Berry and Dylan).  I even loved Nebraska, so don't tell me it's an E-Street band thing or a rock versus folk thing, but this album is unlistenable.  Some reviewers have called it beautiful and powerful.  That's rubbish.  There is a complete absence of melody on this record, as was the case with much of The Ghost of Tom Joad album (with a huge exception being "Youngstown" - a great song).  The apparently willful attempt to alter his singing style to sound like Woody Guthrie or Jimmy Rodgers is just frightening.  Dylan could pull it off, Bruce just disappoints.  But it's the songs and lack of anything remotely resembling melody that makes this record a failure.  Believe, I listened to Devil & Dust 10-15 times in hopes of finding what I am apparently missing.  I couldn't. I thought The Rising was a nice album.  I even liked the Devils & Dust solo tour (Bruce is a powerful performer, and maybe even more commading when it's just him on stage), but I doubt this CD will ever find its way back into the player
The only thing you can say about today's music is that it's disguisting, gross, and made by recording artists who drop out of school and seem to think that a life as a rap music artists is so cool, until they get shot.  Every copy of this CD should be burned
Mostly bland, by this time it seemed that BAD was dead in the water, nothing here matches the excitement of THIS IS. Especially annoying are `Sightsee MC!', `Ice Cool Killer' and `The Big V'. BAD goes rap? No thanks. It's easy to see why they did the whole BAD 2 thing. Buy THE GLOBE instead
I agree with other reviewers.  Don't waste your money.  I should have listened to the samples.  To hear more awful fakes, visit the  producer's web site at drewsfamous.com.  Listen to their selection of garbage before you make the purchase
I remember this album well; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer', as it was released well before "Under The Bridge" made them the bandwagon band of the year, but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right--they never had a good album.For every song worth listening to ("Suck My Kiss", "Give It Away"), there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded.  This album was and remains a perfect example of why bands shouldn't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can.On top of that, the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief.  Some friends and I got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album, and Kiedis was so off-key, it wasn't funny.  They drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals, but the damage was done.  People were walking out in droves
I never really noticed the soundtrack when watching this show on television but I love the show so was a little surprised when purchasing the album that all the non sound bite tracks are American country music songs. Can't say I'm much of a fan of American country music so was just a bit disappointed. I think a great inclusion on this album though is the sound bites from all the leading housewife characters on this show and this alone is worth the price of the CD. Was also disappointed that Danny Elfman's Desperate Housewives Theme is not a separate track and ridiculously has some hidden track attached to it. The Desperate Housewives Theme goes for 0:44 seconds then you have a break of silence for a while but still on the same track before at 1:01 a terribly sung summary of the TV show mentioning Wisteria Lane over and over again follows for a minute and twenty seconds. What ligic was there in not making this a separate track? You would then be able to memory it out on your stereo. I like listening to TV themes and I find this just ruins that track because you need to be near your stereo to press skip after 0:44 seconds. This CD is worth purchasing for the sound bites alone but I guess if you're just buying it for the theme song you'll have to wait for some other new TV theme compilation album to get the theme song on its own. This album also comes with an excellent cover insert booklet with lots of great pictures of characters and scenes from the show.
Simply put, Jay-Z is incredibly overrated.  I own a couple of his CDs but to be honest, I never really liked him.  His beats never grabbed me and his lyrics never stunned me so much that I just had to go back and listen to a specific song again.  He mostly raps about drugs, money and cars.  Nothing special, nothing new. I'm just being real about it, since everyone else is on his d!ck.  I think the reason he's so respected is because he blew up right after Biggie died and he was the closest thing to him at the time.  Granted, Jay-Z does use some good metaphors, but for the most part his lyrics are shallow. Best tracks on this album:Can't Knock the HustleBrooklyn's Finest w/BiggieDead President
what a terrible excuse for music from generally excellent musicians. It sounds like ESPN called them asked them to put a diddy together and 10 minutes later....presto ...instant mush
This stuff is so boring. I can't believe people still listen to this stuff. Seriously come on people! I laugh every time I see some guy trying to play this stuff anywhere. Plus Busta has admitted to having "relationships" with men if you get what I mean. Makes you wonder about a lot of rappers....
Although it KILLS me to write anything less than glowing about Edwin McCain (I think he's probably the most talented singer/songwriter we've seen in the last ten years), I just can NOT get into this album.Like others have said, I too have every Edwin album and have seen him in concert. I love everything he's ever done.... but this album just doesn't do it for me. And I know people will say... "Give the album a chance"..... or... "Let Edwin grow and move in new musical directions". BUT..... I've listened to this album at least 10 times all the way through and it's just not growing on me. It feels "flat" and just doesn't feel EDWIN-ISH (if that makes any sense). Even Grammercy Park Hotel, which I saw him debut live and which is on his live DVD doesn't feel the same on here.... just doesn't have the feeling or soul. I would pick up Austin Sessions over this album any day. THAT is Edwin doing what he does best. Maybe he feels the pressure to write some "hits" so that he doesn't have to spend two solid years on the road in the Black Pearl (his tour bus)..... and who could blame him??? But this feels like he's trying too hard.I SOOOOOO hope he comes back with a better album next time, so I can rave about it, because although I gave this album 2 stars.... Edwin, as a person/singer/performer/songwriter deserves 10!!!!!!
It really doesn't appeal to me. But if you like them that is your opinion. I'm not going to say your stupid for liking them because your different from me. But I just feel that there is way to much cursing for my liking I mean the creativity here is not very high I just feel you could use better words. But I mean THE MEASURE OF A MAN IS NOT HOW MANY GIRLS YOU SLEPT WITH. I mean that is how you lose money on child support. Sex has never been the most important thing in life.Honestly though I mean you just can't see these guys rapping about these same things when they're 40 right cause that is wrong. I mean why be interested in a group of rappers that in 10 years probably wont be making music anymore let alone still be together
I just finished seeing the movie and loved the song at the end and immediately started looking up amazon for this song.  Thanks to Melania for pointing out the song title at the end. I realize this CD is just a soundtrack, but typically most soundtracks also include the ending songs. It is just plain dumb not to include the best music in this CD.  MY VOTE - DO NOT BUY THIS CD. The soundtrack is all pretty generic stuff.  BUT GET THE ENDING TITLE SONG IF YOU CAN - It's great. 
The people who have mentioned Aphex Twin and Four Tet have clearly never listened to either of these artists. If you liked the Stone Roses you will like this. It's not an 'electronic' album at all. I've ordered Manitoba's earlier cd after listening to the samples (the reason for purchasing both these albums) and I certainly hope it sounds nothing like 'Up in Flames'. It's funny, I promised myself I would never buy an album again without listening to it and yet it seems that samples on the net can be misleading, either that or Dan Snaith has had a serious identity crisis in the last few years
The DVD says:Nelly - The Longest Yard, Boom, Fly Away and Errtime; No Doubt - Hella Good; Natasha Barr - Move; Nicole Kindle - Oh My, Oh My!; Lynard Skynard - Saturday Night Special; Murphy Lee - Stomp; Jet - Are You Gonna Be My Girl; The Hollies - Long Cool Woman (In A Black Dress); 216 - U Should Know; Public Enemy - Give It Up and Opus De Soul; D12 - My Ballz and Peter Gunn Theme; Michael Kamen & Buckethead - Jack & The Ripper; Mountain - Mississippi Queen; Methods of Mayhem - Narcotic; The Crystal Method - Roll It Up; Big Head Todd & The Monsters - Boom Boom; CCR - Have You Ever Seen The Rain and Bootleg; David Shire - Fall-Off Truck and Cats & Dogs; Thomas Newman - Creek House; Wayne Hancock - Railroad Blues; Norman Greenbaum - Spirit in the Sky; Union Turnpike - Oh; Ludacris Feat. LazyEye - Get Back (Clean Rock Mix); AC/DC - Thunderstruck and If You Want Blood (You've Got It); Red Hot Chili Peepers - Higher Ground; Kool Keith & Kutmasas Kurt - Break U Off; Univ of Southern California - USC Drum Cadence; Tracie Spencer - Still In My Heart; Yea that's different and prolly a double CD...off to iTunes :)
This was just to much country for this parrothead. I liked one song, Piece of Work and that was about it

There's nothing in this I'd say even remotely resembles jazz. It's repetitive, has a rock beat, and consists mostly of licks taken from other players. If you're looking for backrgound music to play in a waiting room, this might be a good choice
Quality is poor. Some songs are not playing. Avoid buying @Amazon
she is not a singer, she is not able to write, play and read the scores/Music. She is an entertainer! The problem is: you can't stop the stupid kids for buying the celebrate pop crappy albums today. Who still recognize this maid in the next 10 years? it is the same case like britney spears and spice girls! PS: pls throw away the cd from your window or burn it to the hot ash volcanos!!! Thank god for america's future pop artists like this one!
Though these are the songs that make the Mills Brothers famous, they are not the original recordings that made these songs famous, and not necessarily sung by the same men that sang the originals (certainly they are considerably older).  These are OK, but they lack the punch and familiarity (to a fan like myself) of the originals.  The title, though not actually misleading, leads one to believe you will be listening to the original songs--they are not.  I recommend only if you must have the complete set of mills Brothers records
Carlos Mencia is one edgy comedian; I know this because he won't stop telling everyone about it. I've never been a huge fan of Carlos and after listening to this CD my opinion of him hasn't really changed. He claims to be an edgy comedian and that's his problem, if he was truly edgy he wouldn't have to constantly remind us in his CD/DVD titles, his show on Comedy Central, radio/TV interviews and most importantly during his own act. Sure he talks about very racial and socially taboo subjects but so does Chris Rock, George Lopez, David Cross, George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, Richard Pryor (RIP) and countless other comedians and they are much better at it. In fact they are so good at it Mr. Mencia often feels to need to use some of these comedian's jokes in his own act, a true sign of respect for those who came before them; at least that's what Carlos seems to think or maybe he's just plagiarizing because he's not funny enough to come up with descent material. Needless to say I was not laughing while listening to this CD and it wasn't because I find Carlos to mean spirited, or crass, or politically incorrect; it's because everything he talks about that's supposed to be so gosh darn edgy has already been said by other people who are much more funny then he is. There is so much good stand up comedy out there people don't waste your time and money on this joke stealing, self aggrandizing hack. 
Blatant sentimentality without any touch of irony or wit = Elefant's lyrics.  I personally like Interpol and the Strokes; I resent that they are being compared to these cheeseballs
My DJ side:I actually had to stop the music, open the tray on the CD player then check whether I had the right CD1 down-tempo in, or some other CD that my wife played before as the music was so not what I was expecting, sounding more like Deep Forest than JVM. To my surprise, it was Jimmy's Balance 10. I decided to Keep an open mind and listen to it anyway. I went to sleep after the 4th track. The next day I decided to listen to the second CD (mid tempo). Again I stopped the music, opened the tray on the CD player then checked whether I had the (mid tempo CD) in instead of the down-tempo I was playing the night before. Sure enough, the (mid tempo) was what I had in the player, but did not sound much different than the lullabies I was listening to on CD1. When the mid-tempo was over, I thought to myself "well, this would be very nice for an upcoming relaxing dinner with friends". The next day I had high hopes for the up tempo CD, cause well, as the name implies, it should be where the beats and treats are. But No. Not really. The only reason I didn't freak out from listening to the 1st and 2nd CD of Jimmy Van M's Balance release is because for three days I kept telling myself that there is an up tempo CD. I didn't mind CD1&2 out of place pop tracks, I didn't mind the different types of music being played in sequence, or rather, out of sequence. I didn't mind hotel lobby music that reminded me of a hotel I stayed in two years ago in Vienna. All this will be forgivable when I hear the up-tempo, because I was so sure it's going to be awesome. Unfortunately, I was not quite right about my assumptions. Things did not start happening until track 5 (The Reducer 2), I don't really need some 4 tracks on the third CD to get me warmed up. Jimmy warmed me up for 37 tracks before that, in his down + mid-tempo crap. For the most part, this production of the Balance series - especially the first 41 tracks in sequence - churned out some of the most lethargic, way too slow and boring music that could be described, at best, as lullabies for grown ups. As for the last 9 tracks of the up-tempo, it is actually - dare I say - decent enough, but way too late, and even worse, ended prematurely. It should have been re-arranged with tracks in reverse order on every CD to be as follows: (CD3) up-tempo should have been (CD1) renamed (in the car from club to home), (CD2) mid-tempo should have been renamed (at home in the living room) and finally (CD1) down-tempo should have been (CD3) renamed (in your bedroom).  This just makes more sense.  The reason I say this is due to the disproportionate figures of dance tracks given to us (9) to the rest of the sleepy, mellow ones (41). For example, chill out house almost always start with a faster track or two then goes on to be slower gradually. I have never come across a chill CD that opened with 10 fast tracks and ended with 03 slow ones, that's not chill. JVM Balance did exactly that; took forever to ascend to a certain point, then crashed almost immediately. What gives?  Half star for CD1Half star for CD23 stars for CD3My human side:Dance music is not the only type of beautiful music out there, Duh!Jimmy made that very clear in this release. If you want to listen to a wide range of (not bad!) music, then Balance 10 is for you. Dive in JVM selection of what he thinks makes us human; expressions of the soul that goes beyond our daily necessities to survive. As a matter of fact, we don't even need music (or any type of arts for that matter) to survive at all. Still we listen to it, we crave it and for many people their livelihood depends on it. Music can represent our feelings, desires and wishes, and with JVM Deep Forest like music here (as I mentioned before) I can't help but wonder if he is going through a certain period in his life where spirituality and oneness with the world is a priority. I think it shows.
Well, unless you are a hardcore collector like myself (had it originally on vinyl all those years ago), stay clear of this album. If you want to hear noise that you & your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend could do yourself, then forget this album & make your own noise. The best track on the album is the bonus track. That tells you that this album has nothing to do with Beatles music. I give it one star for being terrible & one star for the packaging ;-).    Search Judemac Forever" on msn
Yeah, I am a big fan of moby, and accidentally buying the CD that almost ended his career doesn't shake that, if you want some good Moby might I suggest 18 or Play, this has some quiet more ambient tracks which show some promise, but fail to build up to anything, everything else is Moby screaming in a traditional punk style, which were almost humorous, except, not [this much money] humorous, I am not a fan of this CD, I know he was starting out in a punk band, but his other stuff is much bette

I bought this based on reviews of "Bass Queen in the Mix."  To me it sounds like the West Coast edition of Northern Exposure without the 4/4 house beat.  In other words, its very electronic sounding, almost completely non-vocal and not very funky at all.  I listened to "Eargasm" by Plump DJ's and Icey's "Funky Breaks" after this and it's definitely missing variety, skill in mixing and that "neck snapping" funky quality that make the Plumps and Icey so indispensible.  Not too bad but not that interesting either.  I prefer her "Mixtress" and still have not heard "Bass Queen..."  BTW, my speakers are flat down to below 30 hz and I didn't find the recording quality or the bass that impressive.  Listen to Crystal Method's "PHD" or "Block Rockin' Beats" by Chemical Brothers after this to see what I mean
Hammerfall is one of the bigger names out there in the power metal world, and this cd sounds pretty much like the previous 5 albums. The only dofference is that they have gotten worse. I write this review to the two groups of people out there: The exisiting Hammerfall fans, and those trying them out for the first time. For already existing Hammerfall fans such as myslef, I strongly urge that you do not buy this cd, unless it goes below 3-4 dollars on amazon. For those looking to try Hammerfall out and get into the power metal genre for the first time, go ahead and get this one, because Hammerfall are by no means bad musicians. They can all play very well, but this cd lacks refinement and creativity. Start here and work your way up to the better Hammerfall, which you will no doubt appreciate more. Hammerfall keeps putting out the same album over and over and over, if you know what I mean. All of their songs sound relatively similar, but this cd marks one of the lowerest points in their career
I am a BR5-49 aficionado from the early days at Robert's when the band played for tips and usually played requests until 2am with little or no breaks.  Admittedly, I long for those days as much as I long for stirrups in Major League Baseball.  So I'm nostalgic, "IT'S A FREE COUNTRY."  It is also legal for a band to evolve and morph in any which way it feels.  Yet, whenever I read a review in some fishwrap publication that states that a band has "matured," I can do nothing but cringe.  Here's the flowchart:  Band starts out - Band plays hard - Band gets cult following - Band gets reputation - Band strikes out on road - Band gets contract - Band gets a little more pub. - Band gets contract with bigger label - Band gets new management supplied by label - Band gets "coached" in next recording - Band changes faces along the way - Band changes label again - Band gets new direction from new label - Band fights for identity - Band produces new "mature" album - Band gets lost as cult finds new local acts beginning this process.Gee, I sure hope this isn't how the end of BR5-49 comes about, but enough of the doom and gloom of impending implosion.  This record is OK.  Of course, I realize that any band can't just re-hash the same 'ol stuff on every album, but part of what got these guys so much early attention was the raw exhuberance they displayed both live and on the vinyl.  One part of this was their ability to do cover songs usually better than the originals, and a simple taste of this is what I sorely miss in the last few recordings.  This band live used to be a wild, jittery, moving organism on stage, and although they are still a solid live show (saw them on the last tour at Poor David's Pub in Dallas), something has settled down. Chuck is a great talent, but an early appeal of the band was the vocal volley of Chuck and Gary Bennett. Ok, I'll go cry me a river, but dammit, just go listen to the Big Backyard Beat Show one more time.  Mature?  I just don't want to grow up that bad
I was misled and thought I was buying the entire cd and it contains one song
I agree with the other negative review below- Uninspired, simply forgettable radio trash.  Cliched lyrics?  Check.  Muddy, simple riffs?  Check.  Boring drumming with a couple of poorly played double bass kicks?  Check.  Thank god I got this in a box of cd's from a DJ buddy of mine for free awhile back.  If I actually paid for this crap I'd have to kill myself.  Judging from all the "positive" reviews however, it seems some people at Lava records or possibly the band themselves (if they're still around.  I hope not.) have been trying to plug this  sorry excuse for music. 
The 4 CD mini Gibson Amp 'box-set'leaves off genuine off vinyl 78, and Lp 'harder-to-get' Charlie Christian/Benny Goodman recordings.  Legacy states "MASTER TAKES", but absolutely fails to research deep into Charlie Christian's recording history.Columbia vinyl 2Lp 30779, (1972), and Columbia 78rpm C -102 along with the Columbia "Sextet" Cds leave legacy far behind.The Wang Wang Blues -78rpm isn't in the 4CD set, and there are far too many 'false-starts', which Benny Goodman discarded for a good reason.  Star Dust is only about 3 minutes, it's 8 minutes on vinyl.  There is even In-studio handclapping after some tunes.I have the 78s, many Col. Lps, and there is no "Studio-Live" takes.  This 4 CD box could have, and should have been much better in information, content and genuine Charlie Christian guitar stylings.  The 2 readily available BG Sextet Cds are a better purchase idea, but there are still those super hard-to-get vinyl Lp tracks, which ARE "The Master Takes", left Off the legacy/Sony box set.  Musicologist's suggestion, try to get the vinyl Lps.  Skip this misleading 4 CD set of various tracks, + handclapping = NOT "Good Enough To Keep", (AirMail Special).Try the 2 Benny Goodman/Charlie Christian Columbia CDs, Amazon has both, and most of the Benny Goodman Sextet 'takes' are Master Takes, and "Good Enough To Keep!
My copy of "Reckless Nights..." (and yours, too, probably) has a sticker on front that reads: "One of the Most Influential Musicians of the 20th Century."  Well, I'm so glad that Columbia cleared that up.  Otherwise, I'd have had to make up my OWN mind, and apparently music labels don't allow that nowadays.  I hope similar stickers are included on Chopin, Mozart, and Bach CDs (with the century adjusted on a per-composer basis).Scott's gimmicky fare makes for pleasant listening, but not in such a large dose--monotony sets in after two or three titles, let alone 22. Halfway through this CD, I felt as if I were listening to the drone of a defrosting icebox.  For all the outrageous hyperbole thrown at Scott--no one else like him, no way to categorize his music, and so on, and so on--the reality is that composers and arrangers like Ferde Grofe, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Alec Templeton, and Bill Challis covered the same ground far more skillfully--and, in most instances, earlier--than Scott.  Concert jazz, symphonic jazz, or whatever you wish to call it, was NOT the invention of any one man, and certainly not Scott.  Check out Grofe's scores for Whiteman--in particular, his writing for woodwinds and his constant, Scott-esque use of muted trumpet.  Listen to Duke Ellington's "extended" compositions circa 1929.  For that matter, listen to Ellington's 1933 "Daybreak Express"--virtually the template for Scott's galloping miniatures.  Experience Bill Challis and Glenn Miller's pioneering big band charts.  Or... believe as you're told to believe, i.e. that Scott, and Scott alone, performed this kind of music.  I mean, who needs history when we've got hype?  It's up to YOU, dear listener
First Bill has never nor will he ever be a jazz musician. It seems that those who branch out and play multiple styles are often lauded for expanding the vocabulary. Here's what chaps my hide the most. Bill has somehow captured the attention of hordes of budding guitarist with their effect pedals all strung out as if they were getting ready for a space shuttle launch. It burns me too no end when a person calls himself a &quot;jazz&quot; guitarist, but doesn't really have any chops. I know Bill has been called anti-technique, but what does that really mean? Would you want a heart transplant performed by a surgeon that means well, but really isn't very good at what he/she does? This guy is getting built up as something new and it seems every time I turn around someone that knows absolutely nothing about jazz guitar is throwing this guy in my face. I've been a professional jazz guitarist for 12 years and teaching for 8 years. When I have guys that actually debate me that Bill is somehow doing more interesting things than say Pat Martino, or that Bill could somehow hang in a jam session with someone like Pat Martino, I have to shake my head in disbelief in how twisted and mixed up this world has become when charlatans are giving more credit than someone like Pat who has been on the road for years and paid dues that Frisell couldn't imagine. Is Bill Frisell a Jazz musician, No! Maybe if the guy could woodshed for a dozen years he'd come up with something. For me I'll stick with the guys that really know how to play......Johnny Smith, Peter Leitch, Jim Hall, Pat Martino, Kenny Burrell, Billy Bauer, Tal Farlow, Lenny Breau, Jimmy Bruno, Jimmy Raney, Wes Montgomery and so on
Ok......AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!! As luck would have it I found it a a garage sale.  The only track whorth listening to is track 12 which is ViVi's Theme from FF9.  The others well....They could have done better.  Most of the songs are to put it nicely......SUCK (At least the way they where done).  The only reason I rated 2 (1 1/2 to be accualy) is because of ViVi's Theme at the end.  This is not whorth your time.  Get the imported CD's they have much better music on them
As a peripheral BNL fan, I have always admired the off beat sense of humor these guys dish out.  With previous releases, I have been able to discover new things in repeated listenings.  This cd got stale fast.  Seems to be geared to the tween crowd.  I am hopeful newer releases will stay true to the BNL I have enjoyed in years past
Something that someone who claims to be COUNTRY should NOT do. Even though these girls are already pop, remixing it to make it even more pop was a HUGE mistake! Then again, they have to do something to sell more cd's! LOL!!
I was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as Rhapsody (name changed due to copyright issues) on their 2006 live album Live in Canada. I have to say that I am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort. The group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music. The vocals tend to be oversung, or drowned out by the chaos in the background. Rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements, Rhapsody of Fire puts you to sleep with them. The group does stay true to their fantasy themes however
Think twice before purchase:1. Most of the good tracks are available on the non-copy protected "All-Time Top 100 TV Themes", along with the best themes from other networks.2. This disc has CDS-100 copy protection, so you probably can't upload to Windows Media and definitely not to iTunes.I could not upload from my internal CD drive, only from an external multi-format CD/DVD burner. It still only uploaded to Windows Media, not iTunes.To get into iTunes, I had to add the WMA files and then convert them to MP3.This probably caused some quality loss as I'm converting one compressed format to another compressed format!A time-consuming and tedious process which could have been avoided altogether if music companies would get over this fixation on "controlling" everything.Hello record execs: If nobody can add your discs to their libraries, guess what happens? They DON'T PLAY YOUR MUSIC!!!You might think you're protecting your valuable investment, but you're shooting yourself in the foot instead. Here's how it goes:1. Nobody can upload your music.2. Nobody plays your music.3. Nobody hears your music.4. Nobody recommends your music.5. Nobody buys your music.Remember, this only loaded from a particular kind of drive, so it may or may not work on yours.As Bela Lugosi would say: Bevare
Whomever decided on putting this box set together must have been smoking crack.  Since when did 8675309/jenny become a classic rock hit?  Are you kidding me....come on!  No Hendrix,Floyd,Zeppelin.  Classic rock my arse
This lifts your heart to God as you listen.  Beautifully done
Somehow not up to her earlier work. The instrumental accompaniment is good, but tends to dominate at the expense of Cesaria's voice and the songs don't strike me as particularly memorable. One reviewer said this was perhaps the best thing she's done. If so, I just don't see it. I was disiappointed and found myself wondering if maybe her best days are behind her. I hope not
E40 is the worst MC i have ever heard i would rather listen to someone drag their nails down a blackboard. How on earth can  someone like him get a record contract and sell records. Anytime he comes on another rappers album no matter how good the beats are I always skip the track
sucks. If you like this album you are a poser. That means you think cradle of filth is black metal and slipknot is death metal. One guy I know that listens to norma jean, as i lay dying, and unearth, called me emo for listening to acid bath. How stupid can you be? You posers need to wise up and listen to real metal, such as Morbid Angel, Darkthrone, Amon Amarth, OLD Sepultura, and Dissection
This is definitely not a bad collection, but there are so many better ones out there, that this should not be your first choice. The song Sweet Emotion has been completely destroyed on this album. the entire bass intro has been cut out, and the song starts about an entire minute into it. There really is no reason to do this, as even on the radio, they play the entire thing, as it runs about 4 and a half minutes long. The song starts at a terrible place too. It sounds like it would if you turned on your radio to the middle of the song, then just stuck it on the cd that way. Again, not a terrible compilation, but definitely not a good first choice
Inspiring? No! Pleasant? No! Entertaining? No! Worthwhile? No!What are you folks sniffing out there anyway? Whatever it is, please consider passing it along, because other than the single authentic and melodic track by Patsy Cline (i.e., Back In Baby's Arms, which is available on a zillion other collections including some of her own), this CD doesn't have an ounce of redeeming musical, lyrical or social value in my view. Nada! Zip!Even the Dylan track is junk! The entire CD is essentially drivel, put to the dull, homicide-provoking sound of endless, droning noise, with an overall signal-to-noise ratio of about one (1.0)!!! What a WASTE of an A-to-D converter
i like a little bit of it, doesent mean its good, i wont throw it away or anything, ill just let it sift...wait...and look at the album cover most of the time. slayer is getting better though
I'm a "compleat" Beatlemaniac, and I don't mind the political statements at all, but this is a nearly unlistenable record that I have a hard time counting as a serious musical effort or even a real album.  I would have loved it if it had been a 7" single, "Woman is the Nigger of the World," with the rest of it just words written in liner notes.  After that opening track, the remainder is a serious chore to get through.  It's almost unimaginable that this came out between the excellent "Imagine" (1971) and the solid "Mind Games" (1973), but then again, John was not consistent, in part surely due to his apparent and admirable lack of commitment to being a pop star.  Love John for the genius he was, his commitment to peace, and the great music he made -- it's just that there's barely any of it on this particular record. 
I love the sludge and the roar but the vocals are monotone and the lyrics laughable.  Gimme Earth or SunnO))) anyday
I like to have natural sounds or some type of 'yoga style' music while I'm either practicing yoga or just trying to relax.  This CD just didn't fit.  There are a few ok 'songs' but the rest of it is either too fast/upbeat or there's too much talking/chanting.  I found myself distracted when I put this CD on
There are some artists who have been active since the 60's and 70's and who are still producing vibrant, excellent music. Paul Simon, say, or Bob Dylan. Kate Bush, though she started a little later. All of these artists have evolved past their original sound but are still great. Joni Mitchell should have stopped when she was ahead. Maybe I don't rate as a JM fan because I've only heard Blue, but I've listened to that album hundreds of  times times over the years.  I wanted to find out what she was up to since then, and bought this album. All I have to say is, it was like nails on a chalkboard. I was EXPECTING her to change and grow, but not into some pale ghost of the 60's droning on about the evils of commercialism and modernism. The lyrics are old and tired, and the instrumentation is hackneyed and stale, too. The only good lyrics on this album were provided by Yates. At least her paintings are good.
This CD while full of nice music, is to me rather pointless.It's listed as a sound track but all it has is background music instrumentals.Does anyone know the titles of the actual songs used in the movie?Aside from Crazy train
While I doubt I'll EVER get used to the edited (single?) version of 'Nights In White Satin' presented here, I have to agree that the song selection in general is excellent for a compilation of this seminal band.  That said, The Moody Blues (or more likely, their record label) haven't exactly been shy about releasing such anthologies and hits collections on CD, either.  While 'Gold' represents an affordable means of buying some of the best known and loved music from The Moody Blues, it also is for me one of the most trying listening experiences as well.If I had to guess, I'd say much of the music contained on 'Gold' comes from different masters than the songs currently found on other collections, and on the band's original CD albums.  There are definite issues with the sonic quality of these songs as presented on this disc.  For instance, the music track of 'Nights' is horrendously compressed in comparison to earlier CD versions of this song; perhaps the record label was working with an unremastered single release master of the song (my guess), but the audible discrepancies between this version and earlier examples (albeit, in the full album form including The Late Lament and the full orchestral intro) are hard for this listener to stomach.  I can point to any of the earlier music included here and say pretty much the same thing.  Whatever the reason, the original source material used for this CD could've seriously benefitted from earnest remastering work.  While I suspect that would've raised the asking price of 'Gold', I also would contend that great music DESERVES such caring treatment.  As it is, too much of 'Gold' as issued is indeed quite tarnished, which in the real world given the metal that goes by periodic symbol of Au would've been impossible to do.  But evidently in realm of the corporate music world, when selling music on the cheap and banging out sloppily compiled CDs it's very easy to take the most precious and thoroughly muck it up
Roni Griffith has just come out with her new release "Only You"Its Great!!!!!   [...]She has come back so much stronger.  Check it out. Evi
I definitely understand why this band is classified as emo. This CD helped me solidify the impression I had that I don't care for emo. The album is not bad and the band is tight enough for a young band, but the issue I have with emo and with this album in particular, is it's not really anything. It's not hardcore, it's not really melodic....it's sort of stuck in the middle of both but not quite reaching either one. Maybe I'm not the target audience for emo or this band....I get that, that's ok. I can't stop thinking Thursday seem like they're trying desperately to sound like Fugazi and never really getting there. And that's the rub of it I guess....with bands like Thursday and She Wants Revenge...they appear to be reaching for the roots of alternative/hardcore or newwave music but for someone who knows what the real thing sounds like, they're a poor imitation. The sound is immature and lacks the urgency and edge that the original bands had at the time. I have a friend with a 14 year old son who asked me to burn him a copy of this CD. I think I'll just be giving it to him and calling it done
Anna Netrebko's I Puritani selections are way below the art and skill of Callas, Sills, Sutherland, Caballe, and Gencer. She has no passion, no trills, no high notes that are deep and rich. Her best is in the Russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding Mozart. Her broadcast from the Met Live of the I Puritani was alright, but scooping, avoidance of repetitions, running through passages like a locomotive, and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world..scooping again, and a tight awful sounding high note. The same tentativenes is also here on this CD.She should know this. Her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the masses, not the voice, which is forgiven everything.Too bad; she could be a lovely Tatyana some day.Also too, the Traviata is not that great; Anna Moffo , Renee Fleming, M. Caballe, and of course Maria Callas..Listen to these and hear the difference
There is not much I can add to these reviews here. Just like me, a lot of people here were dissapointed because of the fact that so many classic 2Pac songs were remixed only to sound like disasters. Why would such an abomination happen? Suge Knight is trying to milk the Pac legacy until it is bone dry. Well at least he has done something right if you ask me. It sucks that this is how we are forced to remember Tupac Shakur, over tracks chopped up into this. Die hard Pac fans won't even like this, if they haven't heard it already. I'm so waiting for a remix album of "The Chronic" and "Doggystyle".If Suge Knight was smart you would reissue Tha Dogg Pound's "Dogg Food" on dual disc, because that is the only reason why I don't have that album yet.
what a shame.  c.a. was such a talented and beautiful young woman but apparently got some horrible career advice.  maybe she wanted to be this way, but most likely, it was a manager, or record company trying to create a even more slutty successor to britney spears.  more is not always better, and in this case, it is definitely worse.  hopefully, she banked her $$, cuz i can't imagine that she'll ever recover from this debacle.  that would be as likely as a porn star trying to make it in hollywood.  very sad
usually jerry's scores for movies are priceless,(i.e. the other score for &quot;legend&quot;)but rudy is a little bit too unoriginal and the feelings meant to be expressed seem much too&quot;forced&quot; for my taste.it's ok as a weird sort of comedy album,I suppose,but from the  main theme I was laughing because it's meant to be such a serious experience-but isn't!I think that only the biggest goldsmith efficianado could find joy in this cd.(.
I had the privilege of attending recitals of many of the 50's and 60's Jazz Legends - before they became household names.  It was truly an honor and a blessing to be part of an era that will never come around again.  I heard brief notes from this CD and I must agree that Mr. Winston did attempt to capture Mr. Guaraldi's timeless expressions, but the this production did not have the same "golden flow" as the original. 
No one questions Lyrics Born's talent, which can be matched by few. His breakneck delivery will make you swear they sped him up in the studio, except then if you go see him do it live (recommended: he is a charismatic performer) you realize they didn't.The problem with this release is not, therefore, Lyrics Born himself. It's just that there's not enough interesting things happening around him. There are handful of standout songs on this record, but there is no excuse for it running as many tracks as it does. The skits remind me why I sometimes think the whole idea of skits on CDs tired itself out in about 1997, if not earlier. Worse, the fillers sound similar to the hits but less memorable, making the whole album kind of drag, and the grooves, guitar licks and keys, all of which are good in small doses, become sort of flat after a time, especially when Joyo Velarde isn't singing backup vox. Surely a few of the songs could have become B-sides on the single, or something, instead of bloating the album itself.Do That There, Rise and Shine, and One Session are my favorite tracks, the ones I would say go buy from the iTunes store or something right now. There's nothing wrong with the rest, I just don't find myself listening to them much. I like the concept of Later That Day but it should probably take less time out of the day to listen to
This cd should not have been released because it adds really nothing to this Jarrett quartet's other three releases.  It's like taking a fat paint brush full of cheap house paint and making a greasy mess of what WAS a very beautiful triptych.  "Belonging," "My Song," and "Nude Ants" are all virtuoso, spiritually empowered performances and should by all means be purchased and enjoyed.  But, I'd go nada on this one if I were you.I was sitting with my 88-year-old mother listening to the last track and complaining about how lame it was and she said it was "hum-drum."  And she's 88, likes Lawrence Welk and it was past her bedtime.  (It's past "Late Night Willie's" bedtime too, I hate to tell you.) Heck, I've heard high school jazz bands cook twice as hot as this "Keith and the Somnambulists" incarnation.  Garbarek sounds like he's going to give himself a hernia trying to get out the altissimos.  I can't think of one interesting drum riff in the whole 61 minutes plus.  (Neither can Christensen.)  Les Scandinavianes sound like they need about 10 hours sleep and then, maybe, they start thinking about picking up musical instruments.  Jarrett is as wired as ever, but even he can't keep up with some of the tempos and the overall mood is disoriented, forced and cumbersome.  How any reviewer can say that this release captures the quartet's tight integration, displayed amazingly well elsewhere, is beyond me.      With the exception of "Innocence," none of the compositions are very good, either.  "Oasis" has an interesting, if dire, melody line, but it can't summon the required ambience because of all of the clutter and dog poop around it.  Unlike the other three releases mentioned above, this one has very little magnetism - the first track is all rambling rose jazz, where none of the musicians are feeding off each other.  I don't enjoy this kind of jazz, so cliched and unintegrated.  It contains that Jarrettian need to rush things and gang jump the tempo with heavy-handed neurosis peddled as jazz fusion. You feel like some nut in a BMW is suddenly sitting 10 inches off your bumper, too demented to use the passing lane. (Yes, I know Keith has mastered his scales and likes to crack knuckles with tempos and, yes, I now have a headache.)  There is an interesting part at the end, however, where Garbarek cuts way back on the throttle and swaggers around in the lower and upper registers of his tenor sax in some nice ways.  But the transition is contrived at best and bears no organic relation to the first part.  Only "Innocence" benefits from the fact that these guys are probably taking a red eye flight to New York soon.  It is a beautiful lullabye, arguably Jarrett's best composition.  True, the "Nude Ants" version is all you need really, but something happens on this version of the song that is very special.  Jarrett puts in one of his best, if not his best, jazz piano performances.  The composition is perfectly suited to his virtuosity and sensitivities and the somnambulists, who are still pulling a Code 9, can't screw it up even if they want to.  (There is a halo around Keith Jarrett's head I bet you.)  Garbarek (somnambulist #1) plays the melody with a lot of heart, but he screws up the tempo in a very brief, weak improvisation.  The man is tapped, knows it and decides it's time to end the song.  Palle Danielsson (somnambulist #2) misses a lot of notes (doubly bad on double bass) and goes off into an ill-conceived, top-heavy improvisation right at the beginning of the song. Like Garbarek, he knows enough to STOP and retreat, letting Jarrett take over.  I can't remember a dang thing about somnambulist #3 (Christensen).  But Jarrett's effort cannot be touched and he plays like a true wizard.  A week later at the Village Vangard ("Nude Ants"), they'll all be playing at this level.  If anything, I'd like to see the PM version of "Innocence" included in a compilation of the best concert performances by this quartet rather than a whole release of this mediocre concert.  For the most part here, we get hum-drum mountains, where many of the great riffs from the releases mentioned above are handled like a shaky old butler serving up tea, with people getting burned and tablecloths getting ruined.    In particular, Garbarek's performance on "Nude Ants" is far superior to this one and maybe the mean streets of Greenwich Village got his "Norwegian up."  Maybe they weren't so sure if they were going to make it back to the hotel alive - New York USED to be like this you know - and, well, it just might be your last gig.  On "Personal Mountains,"  it's all polite "thank yous" and Japanese clapping robotically.  Not a tinkling glass of booze in the whole schmooze.  Not even a bonze meditating for more.  But, that Manfred Eicher, such a card, I tell you.     
La Grange is probably at the top of most ZZ Top fans lists, and rightly so as it is superb, but the version contained on this collection is the one where they did some weird digital reverb stuff to the drum track, which completely destroyed the roadhouse vibe of the original recording.  It is so awful that I don't know how anybody can listen to it.  Thankfully they got smart and went back to the original for Rancho Texicano.  Clueless classic rock stations are still playing the version contained here, dummies.Also, Waitin' on the Bus/Jesus Just Left Chicago are two absolutely essential tracks that are inexplicably missing here
This Air Supply should've been cut off a very long time ago.  Whenever any of their songs comes on the radio I immediately shut it off.  Bad ear candy is all they ever recorded.  Mindless, sappy garbage.  Even Bread's music  was more interesting than this
I have been a Ronstadt fan since the early 70's, and although the Nelson Riddle stage and the Mexican stage were not my style, I still loved her vocal perfection.  This is truly the only album I haven't played more than twice (I didn't like it the first time, which surprised me, so I tried it again). It doesn't showcase her voice or her talents. The songs are very ho hum.  Linda, put out a Christmas album (been waiting for years), and try to get sweetness back for this old fan
This CD just doesn't have the quality it should. Some of the songs have had the lyrics cut out or removed such as Danny Boy. I have the Cassette and it was great but this just doesn't do justice to Ray Price or his  songs
This Entire CD & HBO special is stolen material. All this material was originally written & performed by Bill Hicks. Buy Hicks DVD "Bill Hicks Live - Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian" if you want the material in its true formhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0004Z33FK/qid=1130712550/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-5459925-2315938?v=glance&s=dvdBill Hicks was also paid tribute on TooL's Aenima album
A lame group of angry teenagers screaming about themselves. Ironic lyrics like "Image of the Invisible" do not make them intellectual. This trash is not music. Get it off my radio! If only I could give 0 stars..
I love the song &quot;NASCA LINES&quot; which I first heard on a Putamayo world music CD, so I ordered &quot;UNDER ONE SKY&quot; since it has &quot;Nasca Lines.&quot; I figured all the music would be as good, but I was so disappointed. It was very jazzy, which I hate. I'm going back to the Putamayo CDs
right the people i work with love this band and album so really i was pressured into buying this album..so i bought and i thought i was going to be blown away due to the hype from my friends but in reality this sucks more than the mudvayne album i've just reviewed terrible distorted guitars bad production off key singing, half baked lyrics the only good thing is the cover and maybe one of the singles are vaguely average apart from that the rest sucks...don't be fooled by the hype by the press this band sucks so will babyshamble
What a load of junk.  GU 29 CD1 was OK.  Everything else these two have done separately is pretty useless.  Make sure you hear a sample before buying this.  Don't say you weren't warned.
I remember when this recording came out and Wynton Marsalis was being hailed as the second coming of jazz. I picked it up right away. I was mystified by the souless mimicry of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and Miles' 2nd great quintet--this punk was supposed to be the savior of jazz? Listen as Wynton negotiates technically difficult arrangements, stopping on a dime! Marvel at his ability to explore the full range of dynamics within two bars!! Gape in wonder at the fussy arrangement of Think of One that strips the tune of any semblence of swing!!! I get it, Wynton--you've mastered the trumpet, technically speaking, which is no mean feat. And you can read music. Bully for you. The only trouble is that you have nothing meaningful to say. Ordinarily, I'd feel sorry for you, having wasted all those hours of practice, except that you trashtalk musicians whose dirty drawers you aren't worthy of washing. People like John Coltrane, Joe Zawinul, Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock...I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. This music is jazz by and for people who think that the best way to honor the past is to preserve it like a roach in amber, thus killing it.
As you might think, I am not a die hard fan of JMJ, I think that when only die hard fans rates an album, it makes you think that with such a high rating, everybody should love this album and this is not the thruth.Not everybody like this king of musical experimentation, some do but some don't...I like Oxygene and Equinoxe, and even after all those years, they are still good to listen too.  Rendez vous offers some really good moments, but we are far from the perfection as Oxygene or Equinoxe. Rendez-vous is easier to get use to that Zoolook is, but we are far from a near perfect album.  That's all 
The singing is terrible on "Fly Me To The Moon".  Don't take my word for it.  Listen to the free sample supplied by Amazon.com .  At 16 seconds into it, when she sings "all I worship and adore", she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes!  Even someone with no musical training can hear it.The rest of the pieces sound fine
Yes, she has a great voice, but this entire CD is so overproduced, so lifeless, so very boring that I had to force myself to listen to the entire thing - searching desperately for a track that measures up to the voice. She sounds as bored as I was on every song. I hope she wakes up soon before we all fall asleep
This is a great address book, but you should know that the price coming out of the factory is $9.95, not the higher prices cited in this listing
I used these for my toy car and it leaked in my toy car.Thank god the people who sold me the car gave me a replacement.Never ever use Energizer batteries.Use Duracell M3 instea
I never received the product I ordered and need a refund immediately
I would have to agree with the problem of the dividers to separate the dates, it just doesn't work. I didn't send it back because it really goes with my desk and I do like the two small drawers. Maybe I can fit some nice flowers or a decorative tissue box or something in the top bin and place mail somewhere else. I wouldn't have put my name on this thing. Does anyone out there need extra plastic dividers for this thing? You can have mine.
it was much smaller than i thought.  It had a long arm that attached to cut larger papers.  But it sagged so you only kept half of the paper up.  Then when cutting it worked great until the very end.  The very end it would not cut.  Very disapointe
The idea behind the pasta machine for clay is brilliant and makes flattening the clay and gradiating the clay much easier, however,I bought 2 of these from my local craft store. The first started giving me trouble after about a week. The gears started to grind and black soot-like ash came out ( metal shavings?)I proceeded to take the face plates off and clean it figuring clay was stuck inside, meanwhile my youngest liked it and wanted one of her own, so while working on trying to clean and repair the first one I bought another. That one lasted 2 days.I brought them both back to the store.I am going to try the amaco brand and see if it is better
This chair is very comfortable, but I don't think the leather is real. The seat ripped before one month was up from purchase. It was easy to assemble, but not worth the money. 
    I was very disapointed with the smoker cover.  It is made of a very THIN plastic that is simular to a medium guage garbage bag material.  This type of cover needs to be able to be resistant to some heat, weather, and also some general scratching.  Just taking the cover off requires real tender care or you will get a quick split in it.  The company needs if necessary to charge more for the cover and make it more durable.      Sincerely yours,  Allen Vest III
The photo on Amazon isn't representative of the product I received.  The frame is white, or an extremely light silver.  I also bought a LaCrosse Technology WT-3122A 12-Inch Wood Atomic Analog Clock, which didn't match it's photo either, but at least I like it. 
After twice sending the unit back to the factory, the unit worked for two weeks and again would not turn on.  I tried all the suggestions made by the factory.  The following year I opened the unit and tried to see what was wrong.  I found totally frozen fan bearings.  I suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings.  To end my agonies with the unit, I took it to the garbage dump.  The unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable.  When it worked, it worked well.  I believe it cost me about one dollar per killed mosquito
This is a beautiful piece of B-B-Q sculpture and gets one star for looks alone, but it bends too easily at the 'neck' and I'm already looking for a replacement after using it only 2 times!  Looking back at the original information, it stated that there is a lifetime guarantee against defects. I wonder if a snapped off head would be considered a defect. I will let you know what happens. Too bad about the brush. It looked so good with my stainless steel weber...
I guess I must have had the same mindset as Adam in the previous review.  I too set up the main unit and the remote side by side to see if the readings from both units would agree, along with another very accurate digital thermometer.  After six hours, the temperature readings from all of the units were within one degree, but the humidity readings from the remote unit were lower by 4 to 8 percent as compared the humidity reading from the main unit... which is 3 to 7 percent too much IMO since they were side by side.  What good is having a relative humidity function if you cannot trust the readings?  I will return the unit.Also, on my unit, the front wood bezel apparently had a small defect and it was repaired (from the factory) with a wood filler type material... but the defect was still obvious
I was disappointed with these tongs, which was surprising since OXO makes good kitchen utensils.  I agree with other reviewers, it is difficult to grasp and close them.  Unless you have a rather large hand (which I don't), you're forced to grasp the handle so far down near the stainless steel!  When comparing these to my 12" tongs my hand grasp was at the same point - which really made these 16" tongs no different from the 12" ones. 
I ordered The Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker in anticipation of a summer of barbecue.  Unfortunately, the unit arrived structurally damaged.  Based on the state of the box, I would say it occured prior to UPS picking it up, but have no way of knowing.  Sadly, the replacement unit was also damaged.  There were huge dents that broke the welded seal.  I gave up, have requested a refund from Amazon, and will seek a different brand of smoker.  I would definitely advise not to buy this product
THIS ITEM IS SUCH A HUGE HUNK OF JUNK! FIRST OFF THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT AND SECOND OFF THE OUTSIDE TEMP IS ALWAYS OFF BY AT LEAST 12 DEGREES.
We got this for our deck last May and it started to rust almost immediately. I took it down in August to store for the winter. Tried to assemble it today (mid April) and two parts fell apart in my hands. Save your money
Clock does all that is claimed, EXCEPT, it will not accept anything farther west than Pacific Time. SO, if you are anywhere but in the lower 48 time zones, you are SOL.
The chair has good back support and fits a 6 ft tall man well with even a little extra wood to support the head.My stool arrived with the wood split so check it before the driver takes off if you can.Mind the instructions when you are putting it together.  If you don't watch the bolts and the small blurry print on the step by step notes you can get turned around.Also, the wood is almost orange in it's color
The installation instructions require you to tighten the fitting to the point that you break the little black intstallation tool.  Once the tank is empty it can not be refilled unless the station has an adapter.  I have not found a station with one yet.  You can not get the adapter off the tank with out the tool you broke.  They dont sell the black tool and it's designed so nothing else fits.  You have to purchase the whole fitting just to get the tool.  Another $17.00 down the drain. After my third one, I finally fabbed a tool out of a bolt head by grinding the head into the right shaped triangle. 
The spit is a very thick steel bar that is difficult to bend. The forks and clamps to hold the food are solid with thick chrome. The motor is made in Taiwan and my first one came in dead on arrival. Read up on the other Weber Rotisseries reviewed by other customers and you will see the motor is a weak point
Color shown as natural is far from accurate. I am unhappy with color and may return these
Without trying to sound overly negative this is subpar engineering and production at its finest.  First, I was expecting something that would assemble "in minutes"... guess when you dont qualify how many that years are also broken into "minutes".. this unit has roughly 60 individual pieces that require assembly not including nuts and bolts.  Finish was VERY poorly applied and rust was already visible on the carbon steel on the underside of the side burner.  Guage of steel for the cart assembly is subpar.  Amazon has been very good to deal with and is refunding my puchase and returning the grill.  There are many better systems available out there than this.  Very disappointing merchandise and misleading advertising on the manufacturers end.  I made the mistake of buying prior to any of these units being available locally because I thought I was getting a good deal
I have one other Weather Station from La Crosse that seems to work ok, but this thing is a paperweight as far as I am concerned. It shows that it is raining out when the sun is out! It constantly losses contact with the remote sensor and the temp and humidity seems to always be off. I have attempted to contact La Crosse, but as other reviewers have said, that is a lost cause. They never answer any emails regarding product help or issues, and no one seems to answer their phone either. Maybe I have a lemon, but I feel for what they charge for their products, La Crosse should be more responsive to their customers
I spent several months and 5 purchases trying to find a good set of tongs for my husband who is the pickiest "BBQ Expert"...These were one of the WORST. DO NOT BUY THEM. The locking mechanism is clunky. They do not open and close smoothly. The OXO 16 inch Tongs are much better and lighter. You do want tongs that have a hinge vs the ones that are permanently open waiting for you to squeeze them around what you are trying to pick up. Good luck. I had to send these back
I purchased two cushions to use on small chairs.  When the cushions I arrived, I could hardly believe how small they were, smaller than the description stated.  In addition to the small size, the cushions had a lot of stuffing and seemed more like volleyballs than chair cushions. 
The name on this item should be "pillow". It is much too small for a cushion. They need to change the discription to pillow or cushion for your head. I wish I had spent more time reading the whole page on this item before I ordered it. Lesson learned
I bought this thing to solve a problem and I have a new  one, I red the little manual, trying to figure out how to have a projection and no way. It does not stay in projection mode, if you want to see the light projection you have to press the button. I change the battery, I left the clock for 26 minute before to change the paramenters  and no way. I wil buy one more expensive but one that work the projection. Of course I do not recogmend it.
Sounds like a great item, but since I never received it. I can not give it an honest review
Be carful where you place it...MUST be put in a shady place or it reads crazy! Hard to read if sun is hitting it and obviously can't be seen at night
As was the case with the previous reviewer, I did not receive the item that was described.  It is not a Professional Outdoor Cooker but a Commercial grade cooker.  In addition, there are no baskets included.  This set-up might be fine for frying a turkey but would not work for frying fish without additional equipment.  What you'll get is what is shown in the picture - not what is described
NOtice that the people giving it 5 stars are the people who reviewed this product and this product alone.Sounds like employees trying to build up ratings
The thermometer looks good and is easy to use.  Unfortunately the temperature it gave was so inaccurate (more than two degrees off) that I had to return the product
Absolutely useless.  The three gizmos are in three small adjoining areas -  Kitchen / Breakfast / Office areas.  The roaches come out at night and do a little dance to the "clicks" that the gizmos emit.  No effect whatsoever after 3 months
Okay, I am no Master Gardener, but then, this is not a product for a Master Gardener. I am also not wanted for botanicidal rampages. I bought this right after it first came on the market, did everything according to the instructions, found the perfect spot, etcetera, etcetera. About ten percent, if that, of the seeds sprouted, turned into little green shoots . . . and died. This herb garden is marketed as simple, follow-the-steps, sit-back-and-watch-it-grow. Not in my Universe! The only thing I admire about Chia Pet, Incorporated (or whatever the parent company might be named) is their skill at marketing. Each holiday season, as their commercials flourish, I am tempted. Then, I recall the Great Disaster of 1999, and I resist temptation
THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT STATE WHAT THEY USE FOR THE RED COLORING IN THEIR NECTAR.  IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT THAT RED DYE #40 HAS PROVEDHARMFUL TO HUMMINGBIRDS CAUSING CANCER AND IS NOT NECESSARY.NATURAL NECTAR IN THE WILD IS CLEAR WITHOUT COLOR.  USING A COLORFULFEEDER WILL ATTRACT THE HUMMERS AND NOT HARM THEM. 
I got these chairs in july 2006 and was very pleased how they look. After eight months front right legs on both chairs cracked and broke.We are not overweight people (140-190lb). Very sad that we have to replace them, because we were happy with appearance
Radio reception is bad in the city, so I wasn't surprised when the clock didn't set itself. To set it manually, the instructions say to hold down the snooze button for 3 seconds and the time will flash. It didn't.
I received the Lacrosse weather station as a gift. It started out working ok for about 4 weeks. Plagued by software and communication problems I do not recomend it to anyone. The tecnical support team is of little or no help.It all goes back to that old saying,you get what you pay for.A Very Dissatisified Customer.
Much better versions out there, and it is always better to pay a little more and get the good one, then conserve, for a disposable mode
I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list.  I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages.  Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more!  How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole!  Very disappointing!!!!  The makers should be ashamed
I assumed, incorrectly, that Adobe's customer service would be professional and quick. I have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait, at a minimum, 23 MINUTES just to speak to someone. When I finally got my product, they sent the Mac verion rather than the PC version I purchased. I called again and waited approximately 30 MINUTES to get customer help. I had originally ordered the PC Standard version and asked to upgrade (and pay difference) for the Professional version -- since I still hadn't received the PC version. Customer service stated that they would ONLY ship me the Standard version to replace the incorrectly shipped Mac Version and then I would have to wait for the Standard verison to arrive at which point I could call again, and ask to exchange for the Professional verion - INSANE!!!  Adobe's call center is easily the worst customer service I have dealt with -- and I've dealt with some bad customer service
Did not work with my apple computer,requested help but did not get results I wanted which was to return idem & get credi
Why are the newer products getting slower by the version. I still love Version 5. It does not forever to open up in a Web browser..Update: I have been using Version 7 now for several months.. I am glad to say that I am now a lot happier. Granted it still uses a lot of memory. However, the new features that it has compared to Version 5, makes the upgrade worthwhile. However, watch out.. there are several features that Adobe took out from the Standard version and only has on the PRO version..
Don't take my word for it that's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on Slashdot. Be warned: Adobe has not learned its lesson, and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6, this latest release of Acrobat continues Adobe's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment, again, as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done--in fact, it's now nearly impossible. Like earlier releases, this version of Acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop "right click" menus. Adobe argues that these are conveniences, but they are entirely unnecessary (for most of us "printing" to Adobe PDF achieves the same result, is much more convenient, and a more natural model), and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface (for those who don't have the knowledge or patience to customize it) or a carefully tuned one (for those who do). Unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior (e.g. through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog), Acrobat's "option" for disabling this behavior, once deeply hidden in the setup process,is now almost completely absent. To disable the "Convert to Adobe PDF" button that mysteriously appears in the Outlook mail editor, for example, one has to be sure to choose "this feature will not be available" from the "Microsoft Outlook" option under "Acrobat PDFMaker" under "Create Adobe PDF". Simply deleting the button using Outlook's toolbar customization feature will not work: it comes right back when the editor is next opened. Similar problems arise in Word, Excel, Visio, Project, and Internet Explorer. And there's simply no way to get rid of the never-used "Convert to Adobe PDF" and "Combine in Acrobat..." entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files (even if one installs none of the Acrobat PDFMaker features). For the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that Acrobat 7 does, there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web, but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7: ("Adobe has really pushed the boat out with Acrobat 7 and managed to screw Word royally") . In short, Acrobat will make a mess of your working environment, there's no way to completely fix it, and even the partial fix is a pain (and not well documented). (This may seem a minor issue, but if every application followed Adobe's reckless example, our working environments would start to look like strip malls, crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it. One of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs; no application should interfere with that.) Experienced Acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for Acrobat (and most other Adobe applications): it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version. In fact, on my 2 GHz Pentium 4, it takes longer to launch than the entire Visual Studio .NET development environment, and longer than the boot sequence for Windows XP! There are other minor problems as well (arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items, etc.) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough. Unless you really need the latest Acrobat features, you should probably avoid this upgrade. And if the "improvements" in this release are any indication of where Adobe plans to go with future releases, it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management. Fortunately, there's no reason at all to upgrade. Version 7 offers no usefully new features, so you can (and should) avoid this one (at all costs)
1. You can't print on anything over 8.5x14 paper.  Useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale.2. I bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3.0 of Broderbund 3D Home Architect.  It turns out that this is exactly the same software!I strongly recommend looking for something better
I received the package and read the instructions.  In retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well.  It did not.  My installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless.  I had to take it to a professional to get it going.  Even so, I have had problems with Internet Explorer stopping suddenly, BSOD's.  This is not a job for the average computer user
This Roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever.  First, it doesn't work.  Second, I cannot obtain any support from Roxio to find out why.  They won't give support until you register, the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software, and it takes you to a website that either doesn't exist, or is always down.  Thus, it turns out to be a complete waste of money, not to mention several hours of time.  RUN, don't WALK away from this software and this company
This program is average to below average in it's abilities.That said, just hope you don't need any Roxio tech support.Why? because Roxio's  support bites!You CANNOT contact anyone online or by email for help;whenever their dis-functional "web portal" [web-based support] system traps you in an endless loop. I needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is NOT ALLOWED on the internet.It used to be you could download Roxio's PATCHES from any pc having internet access. Then burn patch[s] to a CD, or copy to floppy/jumpdrive.Then "sneakernet" the patches to the pc needing them.NO MORE.What happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download/patch a roxio product directly on MY pc.[EZCD5 doesn't exist on my pc].Instead of simply letting me download it somewhere, like to my hard drive, vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc,[which won't work in my case as I'm not using roxio, nor have it installed on my pc]; apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download/patch process STOP/END and proceed to send the customer back to Roxio's initial patch download page.When you need a patch, all these endless loops and support gamesare enough to get me looking for a different product/different company.If you want to minimize human contact with customers, fine.But let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going.Don't hand over your customer support system [almost] completely to a WEB SERVER. That ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls.Then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem.IT JUST DOESN'T WORK.If a company won't provide access to PATCHES, even after I have logged into their website with username and password, [so they know is accessing their patches] AND they  don't offer any type of FTP site  as a download backup  option, then I sure as heck won't be buying anymore of their products.I see why Roxio bought up CeQuadrat and other companies.[Though I hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that]. When a competitor has a better product, why fight to improve your prodsuct's quality/features, when you can buy the other company out. Thank goodness Nero is not under the Roxio umbrella.
I bought this upgrade because I thought it would let me share my contacts. It says so on the box, but it doesn't. It works just like the old contacts which you can't share with others except if you export it. No live sharing. Why couldn't they make it so I could put the file on my server? Or on a secure site? Then all my office can work off one contact list.50% or more of the time the business contacts can't be found when you search for a contact. It's like the business contacts is an add in that doesn't work with Outlook. Or you add contacts, save it, email to the saved email address and then go to find the contact later and it is gone. Also, lots of times when you try to SEND, the email won't SEND, it stays in the outbox. And repeatedly you open and hit the SEND button but it won't change to SEND status. Now, if you leave it in the outbox, sometimes that fools the program into letting you send other email. Or sometimes you can FORWARD and SEND.. Geez, what a waste of money this upgrade was. We won't be using it on any of our other computers and we haven't bought if on the new computers we have ordered.
I've been a user of Pinnacle version 8 (which I loved), and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer DVDs.  What a disappointment this "upgrade" has been.  Crash after crash.  What is most disappointing is that Pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could "help" them develop a better product.  This means to me that they knowingly released bad code, and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a $100.  Guess what, I don't want to help Pinnacle build a better product.  I want a product that works when I purchase it.Lesson learned.  Next time I read a bad review on a product, I'm staying away
I don't have a problem with the software.  It pretty much does what we need but reversing an error can be a nightmare.  Before I start this tirade, I should point out that the customer service reps were very nice.  But they don't have the infrastructure to provide the most basic level of service (please, read on).  The customer support system for the payroll upgrade on this product is really scary.  (1) They want to have access to your checking account to pay for the annual payroll subscription!!  (2) They DO NOT SEND RECEIPTS!!  I help with the books for a small non-profit and paid for the payroll subscription on my own credit card.  The only receipt I could get was a copy of the invoice, which is not formatted to print correctly on an HP1200 (duh!!).  What is really disturbing is that these people are supposed to be accounting experts!  If you acquiesce to the checking account withdrawal, the only receipt you receive is the line item on your bank statement.  Have they every heard of a "paper trail".  Well you sure won't get one if you purchase the payroll subscription for this product.  I will start looking for an alternative to Intuit because they obviously don't understand some basic accounting and auditing principles.
3D Home Architect is a complete crock. I have attempted to use it many times. After hours of reading and playing with it I am still unable to perform the most simple task. I own V1.3 of this software and it outperforms the current version by light years. I also spent lots of time trading emails with Broderbund in an attempt to obtain either additional product support or a refund and I got nothing. So henceforth they will not see another dime of my hard earned $. Sorry
The computer I have now(about 500 Mhz)is faster than my last one, and the earlier version of Plus! worked well with my older model. However, my current model can't process most of the programs available, so I just deleted the whole package. I intend to get a faster computer in the near future, and will use SuperPack at that time. The features look pretty cool, but I can't give it a favorable rating at this time. However, when I see how it would work with a faster processor, I may re-rate my review
I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2.  It worked fine for a handful of months, and then it quit.  Technical support was of no help.  I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine.  I am so frustrated about this.  I probably spent 100 hours with the data backup, moving data, reformatting, and reinstalling.  If I were a small business, I would be out of business.  All because this piece of crap program, which I purchased legally, decided to quit.  Totally unacceptable
I've owned this software since it's ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception.  Even at it's latest 1.5.1 $299 version Apple should still be ashamed of themselves.  I use Final Cut Studio and own 3 recent Macs, so I've been devoted to Apple to say the least.  I am a professional wedding photographer/videographer.  I have been more than patient with this software.  It looks great, up to Apple's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs.  And unless you pay Apple laughable amounts of money (much more than the cost of the software itself!), they will not provide support on anything except installation...even if there software update is the source of the issue.  As someone who has been such an Apple fan, I feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and DOWNLOAD LIGHTROOM FROM ADOBE. 
When I first installed the program I was able to access the images, but since that first time I haven't. My operating system is XP and I don't know if that is the problem with the software. I have since then uninstalled it. I did not think this product was very easy to use
The Mac OS, $129 list, often cheaper, doesn't get viruses, worms, malware, etc and probably runs all the software you do on a PC, with the exception of some games. Go to a Mac Store and try it for yourself
I use PDFs a lot and I must say that quite often I turn to Free PDF software to actually do the tasks that Acrobat fails to do. One area I have always had a problem with is the formatting of some documents in size and sometimes Acrobat simply fails to recognize them and so I switch to the Free PDF software which has no problems doing this and is easier to use.However if you are a pro PDF maker who wants to add sigs and links and notes and chapters and all the other function tags including security tags then I recommend this product hands down as the best one. I just find that it is not always the best PDF software package in the world, but a good one all the same.I would not recommend buying this one just to make standard PDF files alone. If you want to touch up those file then this is what you need to do that right.
Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version. (For reference, my system is Window XP pro, Pentium 4 3GHz, 2.5GB RAM)
The Easy Language 16 is only useful if you're already familiar with the language you wish to learn.  I've been studying French for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when I'm getting rusty.  The only problem is that it's hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear.  The recorded speakers also don't bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said.  This is good cause it's like listening to an actual French speaker and not a robot, bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said.  It will also go over basic French grammar but is totally useless if you don't already know basic French grammar.      I also tried to use this to learn Japanese.  Unlike French, I'm not familiar with the Japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare.  If all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a Romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out.  Unfortunately the basic Japanese grammar and Japanese alphabet are all written in Japanese.  For instance, in the grammar section it has the past, present and future "I am"  it's written in english then beside it it's written in Japanese.  You can't click them to have it sound out for you.  In the Japanese alphabet section all it has is the Japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out.  So it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in Japanese.  I do want to learn how to read, write and speak Japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read, write, and speak Japanese!   So my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with Japanese (NOT the Romanized(Romanjj) version) already in order to use this product.  Because of my experiences with this product I would say get it only if you know the languages you're interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more.  Since I am familiar with French this product was pretty helpful but if I used this as a starter for the language I probably would have quit.  I'm searching Amazon for better Japanese books. So if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and CD's
Office 97 was a pretty good product. The programs were powerful, had a decent interface (maybe not as good as the Claris products of the early 1990s, but not bad), and came with a ton of features all on one disc. The Office 98 release for Mac was pretty much the same thing. The only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant (paperclip) but it is easy enough to turn off.Office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me. I felt that the improvements were minimal (aside from a bit more stability in Word--anyone who has ever used Word 97 on a regular basis knows it's prone to crashing) and in fact detracted from the ease of use. One example is the clip gallery, which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that wouldn't have received decent reviews in 1988. Another is PowerPoint's outline feature. I always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller. When you use smaller displays like I often do this is a problem. The menus, which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them, were also an annoyance. The manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size.Office 2003 continues making the program uglier. Now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen. Again, this eats into the workspace. The clip art system is even more cumbersome, and many of the clips are online only now. The help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well. Now some people may not complain, but what if you're using a laptop in the middle of the country?I feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997. In fact, the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful. On my Macs, I've switched to Keynote for presentations and Pages for some of my word processing because the new Office versions on that platform are similar.Some of the templates also look very 1997. Apple's programs are updated on a regular basis, and their templates look very modern. Now I know Microsoft adds some new ones now and then, but they should consider redesigning many of them--such as replacing the overused Arial and Times New Roman fonts with something a little more classy.The program is bloated way too heavily. I can run Office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1GB hard drive, but can't even get 2003 on it.A final gripe is that Access is not user friendly at all. File Maker is a better alternative, as it is easier to use and friendlier
Crashes on every thing I try to do. I've never seen such a poor excuse for a program. I paid 70 dollars for it and am now throwing it in the TRASH.
Be advised, this Software is for a SINGLE USER, only licensed for one computer. I bought this for Home use after using SS% for 2 years and V-Com said it would no longer be supported of 03/06. I installed it on 2 home computers, it worked fine for 4 weeks, then it popped up a Box on my second computer that I couls not use it because it was licensed on another computer, I needed to buy additional license for each computer. When I tried to use it on my Main computer, it popped up the same message. So now it will not work on either computer. I uninstalled it and sent it back. Just because it's Cheap does not mean it's any good
This product could put user/customer's life at risk. The mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road. This is the worst product that I have used in my life.
3D Home Architect is a complete crock. I have attempted to use it many times. After hours of reading and playing with it I am still unable to perform the most simple task. I own V1.3 of this software and it outperforms the current version by light years. I also spent lots of time trading emails with Broderbund in an attempt to obtain either additional product support or a refund and I got nothing. So henceforth they will not see another dime of my hard earned $. Sorry
this software is useless.  it is a slow and a system resource hog.  you can download dozens of free apps that do a better job than this for free
I really thought that office was better proir to the whole XP upgrade, but that I will leave to other discussions. This product is your standard Microsoft office products. I am fairly sure that most have experienced their products. There are no surprises and the added bells and whistles aren't worth the upgrade unless your are a VBA programmer. Now, having gone through all of this, I DO NOT rcommend that you purchase this product, but purchase the Student version. Same product - HUGELY different price.
While installing Norton Antivirus 2007 XP, a Norton message flashed that I must delete Webroot for MSN. I did it, and it resulted in crashing the session. Tried first the paying phone support and gave up after 2 hrs wait. Then ried the online chat. The wait went on for 9hrs, started #245 in the queue and by now in lline at #59 I realized this was not the Norton I'd used for so many years, I ordered Kapersky anti-virus.     
Caution: Giving this software to your enemies will gaurantee that they will become mortal enemies, if they are not so already. 1 star is overrating this "product". I am only writing this review to satify some sort of altruistic urge. This software isn't worth a second more of your time. Just click a link now. Good bye! You are still there? OK, read on. I write computer code (C++, Java, C#) for a living and I could not get this software to work correctly. Starting up the "main console" application (read: service) kept turning off the Firewall (service). I could turn on the Firewall - but only if the main service was off. Brilliant! Well done guys on this festering sore of a pile of software. Glad I got my $50 back with the rebates, they should have paid me at least $100 for the wasted time. I spent an hour with their help, chat (which was slow and ineffective) and another 30 minutes tweaking the registry, all to no avail, but lots of frustration. I'm looking for another Firewall/Virus solution now
I bought OmniPage 15 yesterday morning as a download, and have been trying to activate it ever since. After several calls to customer service, forty minutes on hold to speak with a tech rep (who emailed me two links that don't open), I'm no closer to being able to use this program. It seemed to work okay in the few intro uses allowed before you had to activate to continue, but even then it kept wanting to reload with every page I scanned in. The product might be a good one--I'm not a fair judge of that--if only you can get it to work. As others have pointed out, tech support is expensive. If my experience is any measure, it's also worthless. Customer service is unresponsive, unpleasant, and unprofessional. In one call to Customer Service, I was asked if I typed the letters in the serial number as capitals and the O's as zeroes. When assured that I had, several times, she replied, "Then I can't help you--call the tech department," and abruptly hung up. To add irritation to insult, in the forty minutes I was on hold with the tech department, I listened to repeated assurances that a "reepersentative" would be with me shortly.  Not recommended.
While I am sure the product does what it offers, this is the second version of Elemeents that I have not been able to load on my computer.  That's where the fun begins - Adobe's support is dreadful.  Their website is unusuable - other than constantly trying to sell you additional products and services - and they have no human support on weekends
I purchased this product with the hope that it will help me protect my computer without too much overhead and interference. The password manager is quite useless. In more than half the times it did not enter passwords. In cases where it entered passwords, it took about 5 seconds to do so. It also asked me if I want to store passwords repeatedly for the same site.It interfered with the operation. It did not let me go to sites like paypal and charles schwab. When I contacted Symantec support, their response is to disable the Phishing protection when I want to go to these sites.My quicken started having problems. I had to restore old backups and it took me 2 days to finally figure out that it is Confidential that is causing the problems. I would have given this s/w 0 stars if it is possible. Now, I uninstalled the software from my computer and have no intention of re-installing it.I can't believe that a company like Symantec releases software that is so buggy and unusable
i pruchased the 3 computer product.  I installed and have been in email tag with norton support ever since. My computer will not shutdown after installation. They have no idea why.  I have been through the same protocols over and over again for over three weeks.  I was finally told that installing version 7.02 would fix it for sure.  I did and it did not.  I was also told that unlike other products such as webroot, when you buy a three ciomputer pack, then expiration date is tied to installation on the first computer. If the three computers do not have the same installation date-like mine -i had 2006 installed on three computers which were put on at different times-you can lose the value of the subscription.  When I called Norton customer service -i get the reply that what can you expect we gave you a bargain-about 70 on a three computer deal.  The service was rude and not helpful.  I asked why it did not say anthing on the box or in the manual and was told that was my proble,
I'm still waiting.  Amazon says this item usually ships within 24 hours.  I ordered on Oct. 27; its now Nov. 8 and it still hasn't shipped.  Where is it
I was reading the high reviews of Zonealarm so I went to their web site to get more information, and only about 2 pages of their entire web site would even show up. Makes me wonder how hard it will be to get tech support from them. Going back to Panda..
I found this product to represent extremely poor value for money.  I purchased the product based on all the marketing hype and testimonials.  However, I have since come to the conclusion that these guys must pay people to write positive testimonials.This product only covers the basics (levels 1 & 2).  Then they try to rope you into paying even more money for their intermediate levels.I have since purchased a cheaper 'Tell Me More' package (for Spanish) and have been highly impressed with the scope of it.  They have packed so much more value into their package.  And it is a complete package - all the way to advanced level.I think it's really disgusting that Rosetta Stone get away with selling such a seriously inferior product at such a highly inflated price and people still buy it.  I think it borders on being a scam
I've tried to be a loyal Quickbooks Pro user for 5 years now and at first this company provided a competent accounting product that was decent after you learned its idiosyncracies. But each year you will be forced to update ($$$) or your tax tables will not be accurate, and each year some of the capabilities will be lost and you will have to pay for them to be restored ($$$), each year the program will be more expensive to update($$$). I am not an unreasonable business owner and I don't mind paying for good service, but Intuit has turned into a unethical, money grubbing monster. They sunset and disable your software every time you download an update,  forcing updates and buying previously provided services (payroll tax tables, e-mailing invoices, printing 1099 and W2). This is especially true at year end, becuase they know they have you in a tax/year end crunch. Now they are even doing unauthorised billing of new services (last year they started charging quarterly fees for tax tables--this year they charge a mandatoy $300 payroll update as well as a $100 software update for the program itself.) Furthermore they charge your credit card without permission under the ruberic that its the same as the quarterly tax table fee. Honestly, consider some other program! This deceptive practice of software disabling and data blocking, combined with the dubious practice of sunsetting software every year has grown intolerable. I hope they get the class action suit they deserve.
Installed this on my laptop and desktop computers.  One installation was late in 2005, the other was in 2nd quarter of 2006.  Both have tried to fail.  The laptop will no longer do automatic updates.  I can manually download and install the updates, but it is a bit of a hassle.  The desktop will no longer download the Symantec updates at all.  I attempted several uninstalls and reinstalls, won't do it.  The only remedy is to take both computers to a computer shop and needlessly pay someone to fix the mess this junk software has made on both computers.  Because of the problems, I've run into several problems, mostly related to .cab files when I attempt downloads.  I've switched to AVG and Zone Alarm - both FREE and they work
Before using ColorVision Spyder2 my monitor was calibrated with the free Adobe Gamma program installed as part of Adobe Photoshop. My monitor looked great and the photos I printed looked great too. The colors were spot on. After using Spyder2 Express my monitor looks worse. My monitor appears dim, the color temperature is too warm and colors look green and dull. If I had known it was going to ruin my already great looking monitor I wouldn't have wasted my time. My hope was that it would make my monitor look better, not worse. I am not at all satisfied with this product wouldn't recommend buying it. Instead try Adobe Gamma or look for other free monitor calibration software tools online
This is the stupidest game I ever saw for sale- my kids laughed at how poorly the graphics and story were. What a complete waste
H&R block does a much better job marketing software than writing it. I used the on-line version, had trouble registering so chose the option to begin entering data and register later. After about an hour of painfully slow entry, sometimes just one item per page, most of the time looking at "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT" I had to keep an appointment so tried to register and save. No luck, repeated attempts to register gave unidentified error, and I could not save without registering. Finally just left the computer on and left; when I came back TaxCut had timed out and lost all my data. By the way there is a screen which looks like you are accepting the terms of a software agreement but if you read the fine print you are agreeing to let them sell your e-mail to other companies. Even if you select NO you will get frequent e-mails from H&R Block. I will save time and do my taxes on paper forms this year. When a company can't get something simple like this right, it calls into question everything they do
I've used MS Streets and Trips for years with minor problems.  This year I upgraded to a Windows Vista Laptop and wanted the latest software for it.  I have a GPS and I use a Pocket PC PDA so I need Pocket Streets.After I got home I read the fine print on the box.  It list support for no higher than the Windows XP OS.  But, so far the program is running fine on my Vista machine.The laptop has no serial COM ports and S&T 2007 won't detect a USB port. The description of S&T 2007 which includes a GPS indicates it uses a USB port but apparently it needs the included USB adaptor.  I could not locate where I could purchase such an adapter.S&T 2007 no longer ships with Pocket Streets.  Nor could I locate where I could download a copy.  I can (for now) use my old Pocket Streets program because 2007 does EXPORT Pocket Street maps.Finally, within two miles of my home the map list an airport and runway that was shut down in the early 90's.  The main highway a few blocks from me has only 3 exits in 2 miles yet S&T 2007 list over a dozen intersections which means when I get directions I always end up down a dead-end road.I've purchase many versions of Streets and Trips and this is the first time I felt I've wasted my money. Open software can't be returned from where I purchased it.  I guess I'll have to start researching other software packages.
Everything the negative reviewers say is true and MORE. Please note the following as well:1. If you are a college student taking a class online that uses Blackboard software, Vista will prevent you from posting to the class discussion board and answering any fill-in-the-blank or discussion questions on TESTS! To fix this download the FoxFire browser (free) and use it to access your course. Because Vista uses so much memory and is already so huge, they had to drop quite a few little programs that software needs to access in the Operating system.2. HUGE MEMORY AND HARD DRIVE DRAIN. Look at this comparisonWindows XP Professional    Size on drive 1.5 gig    Memory requirements 128 MBWindows Vista    Needs 15 GIG To Load. Does not say how large the program is but I wouldn't think its small!!! Memory requirements 1 GIG!If you check the DELL website you will see that they recommend that you have 2 gig of memory to use Windows Vista. That is a few $$$ worth of memory just to run the operating system while openning a program. Try running a game or doing animation with that kind of a sink hole in your system! The less memory you have available, the slower everything, including websites will load (no matter how fast your internet connection)  What is worse is that to fix what is wrong with it (ie replace all those small programs your software expects to find in the operating system), they will have to ADD patches that can only make it bigger and hungrier for memory!This is the most pathetic excuse for an upgrade that I have ever seen. I would expect some lawsuits before this is over! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
Very limited photo touch up. When it comes time to burn you might as well have customer service on the phone. Pretty much a total piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am by no means a computer idiot, I audit computer systems security for a living. I have had to contact customer support (webchat) at least 3-4 times during the first 30 days of installing the software. The install was on a brand new system (Windows XP Pro), with all of the Microsoft patches and service packs and little to nothing else installed. First Pest Patrol would crash numerous times a day until technical support walked me through a complex workaround to prevent an Active Protection error window appearing over 100 times every 10 minutes (which you had to click to clear each one). Second, the firewall would tell me I was not authorized to visit certain webpages until technical support walked me through a complex process of deleting certain files created by the firewall and resetting the firewall after a process involving safe mode. Third, Pest Patrol never would run a thorough scan. I'd receive two separate errors that either said a fatal error occurred with the Pest Patrol GUI, or that system resources was not available. I contacted the customer support and they told me that yes, sometimes Pest Patrol doesn't work at all unless you use MSCONFIG to disable all startup services (systems.ini, etc) reboot, run Pest Patrol, then use MSCONFIG to enable the startup services. It was a canned reply during a live web session, which means that the operators were probably used to giving since it likely occurs to many people.I haven't tried out the third solution yet because I wanted to remind myself to write an Amazon review.If you are looking for simplicity, or don't know much about computers, look elsewhere. Otherwise you will be in for one major headache trying to implement several technically involved workarounds. I'll give it two stars, since it didn't cause my dog to choke, explode my house, or cause irreparable damage to clothing (which is my one-star). 
I bought this product based on independent reviews by consumer and PC magazines.  The product's performance was OK, but customer service was a headache.  The serial number on the CD that was shipped to me came up as "invalid" when I tried to install the software.  I had to call customer service, who gave me two more serial numbers before the software would accept one as valid.  Now, one year later I want to upgrade my software to the current version (to save $$ over a new purchase) and guess what?  My serial number is invalid and in order to upgrade via the Trend site I will have to pay more than what Amazon would charge me for a brand new CD.  I will most likely switch to ZoneAlarm because of the hassles involved in registering and upgrading this product
They changed everything!  In an effort to make it more user friendly, they've rearranged most of the controls.  Menus are replaced by headings.  It is difficult to accomplish what were easy changes before.  Some of this will likely improve with use.WORD 2007 is constantly trying to think for you, auto formatting as you type.  However, it often isn't thinking what you are, and making it obey your commands is frustrated by the new headings.  Particularly frustrating, when I "right-click" on a list to restart numbering at "A" (ie. after roman numeral II on an outline), WORD 2007 flatly refuses.  My research paper is now formated:I.   Heading  A. subpoint  B. subpoint  C. subpoinII.  Heading  D. subpoint  E. subpoint  F. subpointIII.  Heading  G. subpoint etc....etc...This is ridiculous and inexcusable!  I also had to individually superscript 130+ footnotes.  Somehow, in changing the font from the Widows default "Calibri" back to "Time New Roman," the footnote setting was altered and I have yet to determine how to restore it.  However, if I open a new document it is fine, but I really don't want to retype a 30+ page research paper.POWERPOINT 2007 works well enough, compared to the older version.  They have added a few bell and whistles, but nothing that gets in the way.If you have to buy a new computer you're likely stuck with the new MS Office 2007.  But don't buy it until you have to.  It is NOT an upgrade from the previous two versions
I ordered ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2006 after a PC magazine review,   I have a 3 month old HP Media Center PC.   Th software totaly locked up my machine on install twice.   Each ocasion requireing me to reboot in safe mode and to use the restore function to even use my computer.   I lost 6 - 8 hours of work befoe I decided to return it.   I did receive my refund 8 to 10 weeks after returning the product.    I am now using Norton Internet Security with no problems.  I transfered it from an older abandoned PC.I mave been a PC user since 82 and am fairly knowledge about hardware and software.   This is one of the few programs I could not instal.   I have used the free Zone Alarm Firewall without problems.ew
I have spent the better part of 4 months dealing with these guys. They won't talk to you on the phone, don't let you get support until you register your product with a serial #, which, if you lose and need to re-install, you can't get without a login and a serial #. That makes no sense.I've had technical problems with True Image Home 9 and 10, and just can't get them to resolve it. Very unhappy with these guys. The product looks good, but if you have a glitch, prepare to wait A WEEK OR MORE for tech support to respond by email. Check out their web site and try some numbers - you'll find there's no way to talk to ANYONE unless you want to buy something.This is not one experience with them. It's Feb 07 now, and this charade began last August! Buyer beware
Aquazone is good, but I've found that Serene Scene is a better product. Aquazone is not as realistic as Serene Scene and that is what I was looking for. The realism of fish in an aquarium. If I could go back I would buy Serene Scene instead
I can't get the software to scan past 30%.  The software locks up when I try to end the scan after being stuck at 30% scan
I loved the 2006 version of this software, but when I received an email offering an "upgrade" to the 2007 version, I decided to improve what I had.  I could not be more disappointed.  The resulting product is a miserable failure and I'm amazed that some people are having good luck with it.This version prints everything off center.  I can play with some of it to center it, but not the Hallmark logo, etc., on the back.  The result is a very unprofessional mess.  I went online to report the problem saw they have a FAQ on the issue promising that "soon" they will have a "fix" I can download.  Three months later and still no "fix".I've written Nova 3 times, they acknowledge the problem and issue the same automated response "Keep checking for updates".  Finally, after numerous emails and phone conversations they have agreed to let me return the software to them.When I received the 2007 edition, which in every other way was virtually identical to the 2006 version, I threw away my old software.  I'm now thinking of purchasing it again because I found this software easy to use and loved to be able to make so many changes, add photos, etc.Maybe some of these don't have this technical problem, but just be warned
I bought this product because it combined a number of security elements.  It worked fine until I installed the network security feature.  We have a home network and as soon as I installed the product, the other computers were unable to access the internet.  When I tried to uninstall it, my computer lost internet access.  Even using the 26 digit key did not allow access.  Customer service was useless.  They gave me directions which involved changing the registry. Bad move.  Needless to say, I had to have a computer repair service fix the network, and I had to reformat my hard drive. McAfee assumed no responsibility for the problems it caused,  Dell was nice enought to walk me through the reformat and it wasnt even their product that caused the problems.  I would like to give this no stars
I'm in awe about what this program can do, but I've yet to be able to use it to its fullest. It's not user friendly and I've been designing photo brochures, and marketing literature and multi-media presentations for years with other design software.The Corel_Tutor is unwieldy to use and only illustrates the simplest projects. It takes a week to learn the glossary used for the program. And if you don't use it daily, it's easy to forget the glossary and toolbox icons.I was hoping the "student & teacher" edition would be more instructive, but it's not.I'm currently searching for a tutor who will teach me the complexities of using this program with a hands-on approach
OK, the maps are good, but its very very combersome to use with a laptop in your car. It is very disracting and can easily cause an accident. Does not work aroung Lincoln tunnel area. Also would not find my home street, and I have been there for 2 years. Either the one I got was defected, or its not what other make it out to be. I had to return mine.
I've been a user of quicken for at least ten years. I've liked the product historically, but this version is garbage. Like other users, I too have fallen victim to the 'out of memory' error. Guess what? There's nothing I can do. I can't go back to a previous version of Quicken, because my data file isn't compatable. Honestly, I blame myself for not reading the feedback others had left first. I was brand loyal to Intuit, but now I'm paying the price. The software is garbage, stay away.
This version does not have voice prompts to tell you directions or some of the other features you might expect. Microsoft now provides voice messages in version 2006 and it is cheaper than this version ($59-79 depending upon timing). It is worth the price if you have a laptop. Pocket Streets is disappointing. By the way, it is illegal to have your laptop open in the front seat in some states so don't get a ticket (they allow a normal GPS but not a laptop serving as a GPS...go figure).  By the way, Microsoft does not give a discount to upgrade from version 2005 to 2006 so your only choice is to purchase a new product at full price
This is an item that I purchased from Amazon.com that I am not satisfied with.  I cannot install the game on my computer to play it.  I had a relative try to install it on her computer and she also could not install it to play.  She believes that it could be a damaged disk, and that I should pursue getting a refund or replacing it with another copy.  I hope you can help me with this.  Thank you for your support.

Contrary to the advertising about runs on vista, what comes in the box may not run on vista. Upgrade now says you are up to date but it is not., However, you can use product id to download the real vista version. BEWARE the product license says "The software...is provided on as as is basis without warranty of any kind..."I had a major mess with Nuance's product verification process. When the product did start to run, it was not correct. To date I've been charged for two support incidents(maybe more billing will hit my credit card later) and I've logged 3 hours on the phone within the first two weeks as well as several emails. Otherwise I like the product but one should not have to have hours of grief and pay and pay to get it running the first time. I'll never by another nuance product.
I was expecting the nero 6 ultimate all in one instead I received nero OEM Suite. The MPEG 4 encoder they claim is not included instead there is a thirty day trial. Better business bureau should be notified
I purchased this product after reading many negative reviews on other products (my last Internet security product was PC-Cillin, I didn't renew because of the Low ratings for 2007). What I found was that an huge load was put on my processor, and system memory apparently because I use a program that feeds video over the internet from a network cam.  I never had problems like this before, and after some research on the ZA support site, I found other users who were having similar problems with their processors overclocking.  VSMON.exe seems to be the culprit, and is the main component of the Zone Alarm product.  Everything seems fine, as long as I don't try to use video over the internet(including IM webcams).  I would recommend thinking about if you intend on using webserver programs before making this purchase
I had McAfee ISS 2006 and loved it.  I bought 2007 when my subscription expired.  Oh my dear God!! What have I done!!  The thing is complete crap. My computer is 1 year old with duel core chip and 2GB of memory.  This thing never crashed.  I loaded 2007 and it was crashing every 5 minutes!!  I could not get on the internet with my browsers.  McAfee was updating and Microsoft was reporting the serious errors with no problem, but forget about trying to get help from their website.  They have got to be kidding!!  I tried to uninstall it, forget about it.  I was able to get enough of it off so that my computer is able to access the internet and not crash every 5 minutes.  Thanks alot McAfee, you took a good product and turned it into crap and made a mess of my computer.  I downloaded a free firewall and AVG anti virus. 
If, like myself, you have many DX and VST plug-ins installed on your system, then Audition 2.0 is definitely NOT the choice with you.  Somehow, the idiots who made this junk have made it completely incompatible with 3rd-party plugs such as Waves Diamond Bundle.  Oddly enough, this was not a problem in earlier editions of Audition, or its former incarnation, CoolEdit.  But now, Audition crashes irrevocably when trying to use many VST and DX plugs (except, of course, the ones made by Adobe themselves.)Bottom line?  This software is crap.  Absolute crap.  If you're serious about audio production, go with Wavelab.  Heck, even free multitrack audio software like Kristal works better than this.If, for some reason, you absolutely need Audition, then go with an earlier, more stable version, such as 1.5.2.0 is about as useful as a football bat. 
You've GOT to be kidding me.  The Fry's salesperson told me Microsoft Word couldn't print business cards and that I should buy this product to make high quality business cards.What an incredible lie.This is such a piece of junk.  It has almost nothing.  The cards look TERRIBLE, a total embarassment.  It's HARD TO USE, it's easier to make it in Word.LIES LIES LIES JUNK GARBAGE LIES LIES LIES
slowed a new system down too much when running in backgroud. Went back to free verison
If you have not bought this yet, don't. If you have, but haven't installed it yet, don't. I've used Quicken for years, and this is the worst implentation yet. The major problem, an issue known to the company, is that reports will not print properly on many printers. Wait until they issue a fix before you use this product
Have used TurboTax for years with no real problems.  The low rating is due to the following:Bought this in a store and discovered later when trying to download the state that it is FEDERAL ONLY!  If I had known that I would have ponied up the extra minor $ in the store rather than the extra $30 for download.  Last year the state was included with this version - this year Intuit's new fine-grained tiering of their product line ripped me off!Also, the price for this product is way too high, and the lack of an upgrade path is (pay less if you are a loyal customer) completely sucks.  Intuit almost lost me a couple of years ago when they introduced product activation.  They are in serious danger of losing me again
I bought this as Christmas present for my daughter who will be traveling to Italy this spring as part of a College course she is taking, and she will be spending a semister there next year as well ... She just called me for school to help her resolve an ERROR in the installation: The install reaches 100% then states it has encountered an ERROR, and quits. It remains uninstalled and is thus far UNUSABLE. An awefully expensive piece of plastic that does NOTHING. As a Senior Software Engineer I'd have been fired for less ... The RosettaStone WebSite/Knowledgebase offers NO information on this
Do not waste your money!  I consider myself pretty computer savvy, but this software is not easy to use.  You'd have an easier time just drawing out your ideas by hand. 
I am a retired senior software engineer (web development).  I've used many antivirus/malware packages both at work and at home.  This is the ABSOLUTE WORST.  After installing it, I got popup virus alerts from BitDefender every 10 seconds.  No kidding.  I couldn't believe it.  I previously had a copy of Norton AntiVirus 5 on my computer which is highly reliable (not like the latest version).  I tried BitDefender based on the reviews below which were obviously written by people with less than standard operating systems.  I use a PC with Windows XP SP2 and IE6 (IE7 is still buggy).  Although multiple runs of BitDefender show absolutely no viruses or malware on my system, I continue to get these popup "virus alerts" every 10 seconds when I browse the internet, which is way more irritating than anything Norton ever did to my computer.  In addition, it drags my computer to almost a screeching halt when I go to a web page I haven't been to in more than a day, sometimes even the ones I just went to an hour ago.  I find this truly irritating and went to BitDefender's website and tried their online chat.  "Jack" was completely worthless.  He told me to completely wipe out my cookies, as well as a lot of other useful files for no apparent reason other than he's probably not named Jack, but something like Vishnu and this was the first thing on a long list of things to tell people to do.  Very useless.  Not recommended for anyone.  Try to get an old copy of Norton Antivirus 5 and pay for the update feature ($20 per year).  Much better than this garbage.  In addition, there are virtually no options to customizing this product.  You're stuck with what they think is necessary (like automatically deleting internet files you may need--like shopping carts).  It literally cripples your computer.  
I imported from Quicken for Mac to Quickbooks Pro for Mac and after 3 weeks of trying to make the result work, I gave up. The interface is far less intuitive than in Quicken (for example, entering vendor names by typing the first letters then scrolling through the choices with the arrow keys as in Q) does not work in QB, forcing one to guess at the exact vendor name the first time; and the imported names and addresses do not go automatically to vendors if they have been paid, and customers if they provide payments; rather they all go to an 'other names' list that, with a thousand or two names in it, cannot be simply dragged to the  correct list; rather each one has to be edited individually. When I started forming invoices and quotes for customers, I found that QB would forget the customer's address, sometimes including it and other times yielding a blank field. Also the field lengths in QB are often shorter than in Q, resulting in incomplete import of memo fields. In addition, export capabilities are negligible; one can only export transactions and other details in a proprietary format that can't be used elsewhere, unlike Q which exports in a readable and massageable format. Overall it seems that QB has been written by a different company than Q, and to a large extent the programs are not compatible even though the import from Q to QB appears at first viewing to work OK. It is better to start a new financial year with new software and enter all data in again by hand rather than try to make QB use Q data, in my view. I have switched to MYOB AccountEdge at a rather higher cost, and find that this clean start at the financial year beginning works OK for me. The MYOB product is a little clunkier than QB with more fields to fill in and numbered accounts all over the place, and its Q import is a total joke (with repeated questions on where to allocate accounts for each transaction without an explanation screen) so that import of any more than 10 transactions becomes laughable) but its export abilities are wonderful and I think its inventory control is better than QB; also, it has not yet lost invoice addresses the way QB did on me. One has to input addresses in fields before memorizing tranactions however otherwise the memorized transactions in MYOB don't update. I have found that MYOB is about as intuitive as Q when it comes to entry of payee fields etc; while QB has lost that data entry ease entirely. QB may have an advantage if your goal includes payroll however; MYOB seems to have a pretty sad service unless you are prepared to pay all of the taxes yourself.
They changed pretty much everything. For starters they completely removed all of the normal menus such as File, Tool, and Edit. Which means you can't use the keyboard for quick and easy menu access. Well maybe you can, but you would have to memorize all of the commands instead of having the nice little visual cues which made previous versions of Office (and almost all other PC programs) so much easier to use. You basically have to use the mouse for everything. And in my experience there is no faster way to repetitive stress injury than over-mousing.The Ribbon is just awful. First of all it's huge. It takes up about FOUR TIMES the space of my customized toolbar. They place nearly every button imaginable on it. And as far as I can tell you can't change it around or simplify it. Every function is displayed all the time whether you need it or not. Which makes finding anything a real pain in the neck. You can make the ribbon retract which at first glance seems nice. But in reality it turns what used to be simple 1-click operations into 3-click operations (extend ribbon, spend several minutes searching for button, click button, retract ribbon). Good grief! What a pain.This software didn't last 24 hours on my system before I restored my old version of Office. This new interface is about the most awful thing I've ever seen on a computer. I know of certain free open source office suites that I prefer to this monstrosity. That being said I still prefer any and all previous versions of MS Office to the free one. In fact I would rather be using my old Wordperfect from 1995 than this *thing* that MS is trying to shove down our throats. If only I hadn't thrown that disc away six years ago...Before you "invest" your money in this software I strongly recommend you download the free trial version. Then buy an earlier version
I have always used Norton antivirus, and had no problems with it at all. I have recently had to migrate to Outlook 2003 and Norton IS 2005 and have non-stop system crashes. I have now uninstalled it and resinstalled my old version of Norton Professional and hey presto everything is working again - and not talking two hours to load.
I bought this product to assist in recovery, but I tried to recover a program and it would not work. Does real well on a complete recovery but do not expect a partial. Works well on recovery of My stuff
This is THE BEST SELLING Bible in America for good reason! Ease of comprehension, lovely modern English, pleasing packaging, and the best conservative scholarhip for both textual reconstruction and language translation.Read I WAS A TEENAGE JEHOVAH'S WITNESS and JEHOVAH UNMASKED for two of the wildest rides ever!
I had to upgrade to MS Works 7.0 due to Y2K issues. I am not nearly as satisfied with MS Wortks 7.0 as I was with MS Works 4.5. I am now searching for a replacement
The "bad serial number" routine as the first reviewer. I'll try Adobe Customer Service when I stop fuming
You can get Mac OS X for 129 bucks and it has everything as opposed to the Microsoft's 227 dollar Home Premium which is the low end. Buy Mac and get all the functionality in one OS. When spec'ed out the system are comparable in price, except apple doesn't offer low-end hardware options which is why they seem more expensive
Buyer beware. If you encounter a technical issue with this product and require a refund, you're out of luck. They will send you in endless circles attempting to get a product refund. There are many other good products out there that do the same thing. It's really easy to purchase, but impossible to get a refund
Norton is now owned by the huge behemouth Digital River, who haven't a clue how to run support or customer service.  They are useless and anything with their grimy mits on it and we take a wide berth of it, wouldn't consider it.  Norton used to be top notch, now it is like pouring mollasses into your computer.  It interferes with everything.  Microsoft seems to have given up on them too, as Norton has not bothered to interface properly with Windows, a consequence being that it is also buggy and problematic.  I can only warn you ~ AVOID!!!  A bad bit of software and a company that hasn't any clue about what customer service is and doesn't look likely to change.  Profit seems to be likely more important to them than service or keeping the Norton family of software up to date and working well... 
I bought this software two days ago, Installed it on my laptop and all of a sudden, my network connection was messed up. I could not figure how to connect to the wireless or wired network. My other computers were still able to connect, so it was a problem with the computer with Fix It installed. After much work, I finally uninstalled the software and right away was able to get back on the network. I am not sure if there is some kind of firewall setting with the software, or if it was just the software itself.Anyway, I am unsure whether to reinstall this software or not
I'm not a tech guy.  But from a simple user's standpoint, there is no reason whatsoever to change unless you just have to have a small change in appearance.  About 1/2 the software you might have purchased that worked with XP won't work with Vista.  I was thinking that Vista would be an improvement.  But there is nothing there.  Just some minor superficial changes as far as I can tell.  Maybe for IT people, there might be some big difference, but for your average user, there is no improvement at all.Save your money.  Don't buy it. 
I have a 2 month old high-end Dell PC with tons of memory and disk, running Windows XP Pro.  This game doesn't work.  Period.  First of all, when I installed it, it reset my graphics options.  Second, when I attempt to play a game, even at the settings that it chose, I get nothing but a white screen.  After numerous tries, and killing the program with the task manager, I finally attempted the other Activities options.  Clicking on them does absolutely nothing!  It doesn't recognize my mouse clicks.I'm assuming that the game was written for the Apple Mac, and ported to the PC.  Trust me, it doesn't work.  BTW, we have tons of other kids games and have never had a problem with any of them.  Now I have to figure out how to return this silly thing. 
I was able to install most of MS office but am having printer conpatability problems.   I wasn't able to install Vitural Pc properly and get error messages when i boot up.  I'm going to have to the Mac store genius bar to get the problems straightened out.  All in all I think that every thing will work OK but I'm going to have yto travel over 50 miles to get it fixed.  Maybe it's best to stick with Mac software for Macs.  I've NEVER has a problem installing them
It is difficult to use words harsh enough to describe this product and this company.I have owned this software for about 80 days. 1. In 80 days of use this product has completely locked up or not opened twice.2. I have called the 'support' line 4 times. The minimum time I was on hold was 40 minutes.3. My initial 'support' period is about to expire and I now will have to pay $200 to get more 'support'4. You have to buy additional software to get your data onto a palm device.In summary: The product has locked up about every 40 days and the average hold time is 40 minutes when you call them.Save yourself the grief - buy nothing or buy something else
 Microsoft should have done more testing on this product.  This is one mess up product.  I have never seen a version of Microsoft Windows so mess up.  There are so many bugs in this product it is not funny.  I've always been a big Microsoft fan, but I can't endorse this version of Microsoft Windows.  I'm a PC and Console gamer and let me tell you something.  Microsoft Windows Vista does not go with most PC games.  That is very sad. Even if Microsoft gave me a free version of Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium, I wouldn't take it.  I've read where some Federal Government Agencies won't even use Microsoft Windows Vista because it so mess up and it has so many bugs in it.  I'll stick with Microsoft Windows XP which from what I understand pretty much does all the same things that Microsoft Windows Vista does but without all the bugs in it. Plus you can play any PC game on Microsoft Windows XP.  You can't do that with Microsoft Windows Vista.  I love Microsoft Windows XP. Why should anyone waste their time and money upgrading to Microsoft Windows Vista if it doesn't work right?  It is really frustrating because brand new PC games coming out right now and in the future aren't compatible with Microsoft Windows Vista.  If you don't believe me, go into different gaming web sites and read about all the problems people are having playing brand new PC games that just came out with Microsoft Window Vista.  Please Microsoft, fix Microsoft Windows Vista
if you have used the online version in the past, stick with it. buying it on disk does not allow you to import data from previous returns if done on line and you can not upload to myturbotax. almost as if two separate companies! plus the User interface on this software stinks bigtime. very hard to navigate back and forth. online version is actually better (though i didn't try it this year). does intuit actually employ programmers or watch real users? they spend far too much money on useless features like videos and not enough on simple ui issues
I purchased this item from Amazon.  The disc had scratches and was unable to either use it or get my money back.  These items can not be returned
...buy it here and save $s!Shipping cost from the UK added $46.95 to the price AND a Foreign Debit Card Transaction fee of $2.51 for a waste of $49.46 that could have been spent getting additional models.Or get the download version and save even more as like someone else pointed out, the included manual is near useless and has not improved since version 4. Practical Poser 6 is still the best book to get if you are serious about doing Poser 6 development
Although this dictionary's contents are extensive, the screen functions are relics from the DOS era.  They are laborious and clumsy.  To find a word for difinition, it has to be spelled perfectly, there's no list of proximations to the word entered.  Changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor doesn't show up in the entry slot. If someone knows of a better software, I'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks!!  Maria McGowan 
I purchased this product thinking that it would revolutionize my financial organization -but I should have known better after I have started to read all of the product reviews.I can't even give a thorough review, since I can't seem to get past even downloading my savings & checking information from my bank.  The incorrect balances are showing, and the register doesn't show all of the transactions that my banking website shows.  I'm finding that I have to actually check my banking website to cross-check Quicken!  To me, that ain't so quick.I've just spent over 45 minutes on an online "chat" - which was more of a waste of time than anything.  The customer's support suggestions pretty much entailed deleting files, restarting, deleting files, restarting.10 minutes ago, he wrote this:Ashish R.: Thank you.Ashish R.:  Please  give me 2 minutes only.Stacey: I think I would just like to return the product...Stacey: It isn't working...Stacey: are you still there?Stacey: Right...Stacey: Hello?I'm still sitting here waiting.  I want to return this product - DO NOT BUY! 
I consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds.  I have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and I still feel like they are a little bit too big.  I think that for a "small" backpack, that they are just too large.  Thank you
I gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf.  This pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it.  It has problems that need modification.  The top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body, making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb.  That means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely.  Remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it.  Add some adhesive Velchro to the back of the case.  Make a fabric band for your ankle.  Attach the ends to each other with Velchro.  Put a strip of Velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band.  I get  accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle.  I got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline.   The hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted.  I opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring.  The strut is made of thin brass.  Aluminum from a soda can would work, too.  I made a "V" in one end of the strut to hold the spring.  I pushed lightly against the spring from the left side, drilled a hole in the brass, and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board.  The strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it.  I now have quite a few miles on the pedometer.  (I have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely.)Several times the pedometer reset itself to "0" for no apparent reason.  I know nothing pushed on the reset button.  One incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security.  Once it reset while I was walking.  Twice it reset while I was napping on the sofa.  I am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit, but I do not know.  Static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers, too.  This pedometer uses a counter circuit.  If someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter, connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts.  Connect a button switch to the two wires.  Freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue
I bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching TV...I wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive.  What it boils down to is that this is a "foot hook" tied to a bar with a nylon strap.  The nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly.  The idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit-ups/crunches...the problem is that the nylon strap doesn't actually hold your feet down.  I wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room.  Negative on both accounts.  You need a good sturdy door to implement this product, and then it still doesn't truly hold your feet down.  Looks like I'll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down
I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year.I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy.
I bought this model a year ago, and replaced the deck after approximately 8 months.  Just recently, the deck cracked again.  Of course the warrantly no longer applies.  Save yourself the headache of dealing with this company and spend a little extra to upgrade to a better brand.
I consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds.  I have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and I still feel like they are a little bit too big.  I think that for a "small" backpack, that they are just too large.  Thank you
This pillow is too small and it is not comfortable at all
I got four boxes of these matches so I was motivated to learn how to use them.  I had read the directions about poking them into the lid.  I tried stroking and poking at various angles and finally got one to light after about 10 minutes.  It burned down to the wood portion and went out.  Incidentally, these matches are very short. Perhaps one is supposed to light them with a lighter
I bought this set after reading the positive reviews but I must say that I am terribly disappointed. Two of iron broke (yes, broke!) while I was practicing in the range. Its completely worthless and I strongly suggest to stay away from this set
The idea is great for my son who studies karate, but the quality of the product is below sub par.  The pump broke two pumps into blowing the thing up.  I spent the better part of the night hallucinating while blowing up this thing.  Everyday it had to be blown up again WITHOUT THE PUMP!  I told my son it was garbage and said he could practice on his big sister.  DON'T cheap out with this
This cargo carrier is so flimsy that I thought it would fall apart before I got to my destination.  The hinges are a joke and barely work.  It is also a nightmare to assemble
they dont even go where u want them to they suc and i dont recomend buying the
This bokken is only for looks and not hitting ant thing I used it for less than five mintues and broke. It has a nice look and feels good but does have blemishesand. Also say if you accidentally hit something even a little hard it breaks. The company does a lousey job of wrapping the sword too. The barcode sticker failed to come off in one piece and I ended ripping off some of the finish of the burgundy version of this bokken. I spar with my friends all the time and would have to recommend the bokkens from karate depot instead of this inadequate piece of whatsit. Anyone,honestly, that tells you differently is wrong
I bought this bike thinking since Jeep put its name on it then it should be a great, tough, rock solid ride! Boy was I wrong! Not only the bike feels cheap and extremely heavy, its mechanics are worst part. After taking it to a bike shop to get it tuned professionally, 10 of its gears still don't work. Now you may say well the mechanic did a quick crappy job, let me tell ya, I stood by the guy as he worked on it for 2 hours yet the gears still didn't work. Overall, I'd have to give this bike two thumbs down. You're better off buying a bike from walmart
I got this for my boy scout's birthday.  He really liked it and it is cute but it was a lot smaller than I thought it was.  I'm not sure if it is usable.  My son hasn't tried using this yet
The pedometer worked great for the first two weeks. Than my 1 1/2 year old snatched it off my jeans, it fell on the tile floor and broke the casing of it. It still worked, but I had to be careful when I opened it because the back was broken and no longer attached. Last w/e it stopped working completely. Everthing is set to 0 and won't move. My husbands odometer seems to be working fine. However, I'm dissapointed for the short life-span....M. L. McDermot
Two Amazon's statements about this product were absolutely misleading:1. "Usually ships in 24 hours". It actually took 1 week to ship it.2. When I finally received the package it turned out that the watch didn't have "leather band". The band was made of artificial materials (nylon and rubber) or something like that.I will have to return it
We recieved two of these for my daughter's first birthday. She LOVES being in the pool but this float ALMOST changed EVERYTHING!!!!The inner tube sinks underneath the top tube no matter how you try and fix it or blow it up. My daughter FREAKED OUT!!!! She had never been afraid of the water until we put her in this.DO NOT waste your money
This is the first product I've bought through Amazon that I wish I could give a negative star rating.  After involving three adults and spending about 3 hours troubleshooting, I've concluded this product **** DOES NOT *** work.  Customer service cites this is a "product upgrade".  A video shows cable wrapping around pole and unleashing with sufficient velocity to hit.  What we received was a cable of similar rigidity to what you would lock your bike up with or tow a small vehicle.  It would barely even unwrap.  Imagine Derek Jeter in the photo trying to hit the ball three inches from the pole at 1.5 miles per hour and you can begin to understand this product upgrade. 
This ramp set is really fun to skate on, but keep in mind that it takes a lot of damage. First it will begin to slide when you skate on it due to lost rubber bottoms. Screwing screws into the edges of the ramp can somewhat solve this problem. The worst thing that happens is when the front of the ramp begins to curl upward, making it so you have to constantly pull it back down. I forgot to do this one time and my skateboard wheels locked up and I went flying. But don't let this turn you away. It is a good fly box nonetheless, but just keep in mind that a homemade wooden one would last you a lifetime, not a year.
I got this net and set it up in February and been using it fairly regularly. I was hitting some balls tonight and noticed some tears in the netting much to my disappointment! Shouldn't a $100.00 golf net last longer than 3-4 months?Completely unacceptable
I ordered this bike for my granddaughters 4th birthday.  The first shipment arrived on schedule, but the box was total destroyed and without opening you could see that the bike was scratched and dented.  Delivery was refused and another bike was sent.  The 2nd bike arrived, with the box being in less than perfect condition, but delivery was accepted.  When my son started assembling the bike, he found that several of the parts had been assembled at the factory incorrectly and he could not assemble the bike.  The bike was returned for a credit and we went and purchased a similar bike locally.  We still have not received a credit for the return of the bike.  I am very disappointed and will not purchase from this vendor again
There is nothing wrong with the knife itself but there is a major design flaw. The ring to attach the knife to say a set of keys is on the wrong side; so the open knife is not away from the set of keys. This is the first swiss army knife I have ever come across with this flaw. So alway make sure the ring is opposite the swiss army logo!!
I bought a pair of these as a workout set for heavy bag use, and have been mostly disappointed with them for that purpose.Pros: Easy on and off, even putting them on by yourself. Wrist straps are simple and hold well. Breathe surprisingly well for the design.Cons: Even with hand wraps on, I found my right glove to fit too poorly to absorb punches well; the design makes it hard to form a proper fist without trying to grip the glove into a proper position to do so. The left I have no problem with for some reason, maybe just have a bad pair? The padding makes blows glance off of the bag to a degree that it made me feel like I was risking injury when using them for actual impact punches. Grips make my hands feel too open when punching, can't grip a tight fist... my hands would be bruised or very sore after even a modest workout with them
these clubs are a waste of money.  The graphite shafts from cougar in a senior flex that is way uncontrollable unless u are 75.  My 8 iron broke the first time i hit it.  The bag is falling apart.  Save ur money and buy a quality set of clubs.  U can get some clone clubs that will last years and u'll play twice as better for just a tad more
I love the lenses but these goggles are painful to wear.  I tried various adjustments but they are still too uncomfortable.  I sent an email to Speedo  to let them know.
The snap on the Leapers "Elite" Drop Leg Holster (the term Elite must be used loosely) would never stay attached. It would always either unsnap or come loose at the back. Eventually it fell off in the field and I lost it. The straps would never stay securely in the place I positioned them. The Leapers Deluxe Drop Leg Holster is much more effective. Even w/ one strap it stays secure becuase of the wide band of material in place. The method for latching the gun in the holster is much more effective as well. Spend a few more dollars for the Deluxe holster rather than trying to work with the Elite
I bought both the Ark III and the Super Ark.  The Super Ark is a slight improvement over the Ark III but I would never recommend people buy either one.  There are far better entry-level kits, for just a few dollars more, available from other sources.  The Ark III contains 24 oz. of water, a food bar, and a small, inexpensive emergency blanket in a Kleenex-sized cardboard box.  I'll use the products in the two kits to supplement the emergency kits I subsequently purchased.I'm surprised - and disappointed - Amazon carries these products
It is reasonably accurate. The numbers displayed are formed irregularly. You can't zero it out by zeroing one category i.e. Distance. The price is reflective of its quality
This item was sent back the sleeping bag was not sent and was on the invoice.  I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY REFUND CHECK.  This is the first time I have had any problems with items sent on Amazon.  I like Amazon because I can send a personal check and not a credit card.  Please send me my refund.Candice M. TresslerJanuary 9, 200
Wow I thought THULE was THE company for this type of stuff.  Boy was I mad after a trip from NJ to SC.  The bag was mounted to my roofrack and was a little noisy (top be expected).  But when I got to SC and opened the bag....the horror!  The inside lining shredded and flaked off on everything!   There were also 2 holes along the to seam!  What a mess...and I couldn't use the bag on the way home....had to ship my stuff home!  I just wrote THULE....we'll see if they come thru for the customer Sept. 12, 2005 THULE sent me a replacement, an Escape 2.  Great customer service....but does this mean the Escape is better?  Is the Quest inferior?  There was no coorespondence with the repalcement...I'll try it out this summer
I used this ball with exercise video 4 times.  On the 5th day, my 16 yr old daughter was sitting on it talking on the phone and it exploded, sounded like a tire blowing out and the ball ended up with a two foot piece blown out of it not just a hole.  
This piece is really quite over-priced for what you get, though not having the knife allows you to bring this on a plane with you.  I've seen this unit marketed elsewhere as a "travel-friendly" Swiss Army tool (not knife).Nevertheless, the unit I have is the 64MB version of:ASIN: B0002VM8ZM...which costs considerably less (~$30) on Amazon, has the same 128MB USB drive and red light as the unit on this page, plus you get a small quantity of Swiss Army tools INCLUDING a knife.  Unless you are concerned about going on a plane, I'd recommend the ASIN: B0002VM8ZM over the unit on this page.  BTW, I got my handy little 64MB unit (which I'd give four stars for if I had the option) for only $9.99 on clearance at Target.
First of all I'd like to say how much I loved my Thighmaster.  I got one four months ago from a Sportmart and it has been part of my daily routine ever since. I have much better thigh muscles and a lot more confidence in myself because that little invention made of foam and an industrial strength coil. With that said, I have a slightly amusing and mildly alarming anecdote for you.I was just beginning my strength training exercises and I had just done my second rep with the Thighmaster and all of the sudden I heard a loud pop and it fell to the ground . . . IN TWO PIECES! Now there are two things that immediately crossed my mind, "Wow man, my thighs must made of STEEL!"  and the other more likely scenario "Wow man, it fell apart after four months, this must be an inferior product."  Anyway I e-mailed SuzanneSommers.com in hopes that it was a fluke and that I had gotten the one crumby thighmaster.  I asked them if it was possible to replace it, and sadly although I only owned it four months I was told " It may be time for a new thigh master as the product is not designed to last forever."   Last time I checked, four months is NOT anywhere near forever.  A year, six months maybe, but when you divide the cost of a thighmaster by the amount of time I owned it, the costs outweighs the benefits.  It is even less comforting that the company wasn't surprised or alarmed by their product's short lifespan.  It seemed that if four months is akin forever to the people at suzannesomers.com, then the product's usage expectancy is not much more than that.  It makes me unhappy to have ruined such a handy little device with normal wear and tear, but I can't really afford to buy a new one every four months.  I just wanted to give everyone a heads up and let you know that although it is theoretically a great product, the durability is highly dubious.  And the suzannesomers.com, who referred me to the manufacturer's warrantee only think that a thighmaster should work for three months maximum.
To describe these as "light and cheap" is exactly right.  And neither is a compliment.  My Thera-band handles started crumbling after only a few weeks of regular (3 or 4 times a week) use.  The foam rubber on the handles is obviously cheap quality and started fraying at the edges.  After picking up several chunks of foam off the floor, I learned that tying my own handles at the end of the Thera-band stretch bands works better -- and is free.These handles simply are not sturdy or well-made enough to hold up for the use they are intended for.  Save your money
I bought this boat for my son when he was 8 months old.  He liked the boat well enough...even played with it when it was sitting on dry land.  However, in the water, this boat is VERY tippy, requiring two adult hands AT ALL TIMES.  Not good if you have more than one kid and NEED that extra hand.  I bought a much sturdier boat that still of course needs constant supervision but is great and can be used for more than one summer.  I wouldn't recommend anyone put their baby in this boat
There was a click in the crankshaft that was loud enough to be heard while riding and felt by the foot through the left pedal every 360 degrees of pedal rotation.I purhased a crank puller tool for $21.44 (incl tax), a crank wrench for $18.18 (incl. tax), and grease for $6.38 to repair this brand new bicycle.Upon disassembly I found two (2) metal shavings, each about 0.25 inches in size, that appeared to be from drilling.  I have saved the two (2) metal shavings.I removed the metal shavings, cleaned and re-greased, and the clicking noise and vibration was fixed.Since this was a brand new bicycle, it would seem reasonable to reimburse me for the tools required to repair it.  The total cost, not including and labor, is $46.00.
This gun broke in the first few used.   When I called for service, they inisted on waiting for the tech, and then the return was going to cost almost what the gun  cost.Overall...  this was a writeoff
In less than 3 months the seals didn't work because the velcrow came apart.  Everything inside gets wet.  Poor product
I am not a big spender, but unlike a lot of things, the more money you spend, the better bike you get.  I really didn't want to spend a lot for a bike for a 5-year-old, and I wish I would have gone with my first instinct and bought one from a bike shop.  I'm so frugal that I couldn't stand the idea of paying $140 for a bike for a kid, so I got this one instead (which was actually more expensive when I bought it.)  This is a mediocre bike at best, MAYBE one step above a big box store bike, just maybe.  I wanted a simple bike that would last while, but I will be surprised if this one makes it one summer.  Paint chips easily and the white bike seat is clean for only the first few minutes out of the box.  The components seem cheap and the frame does not seem very solid.  The difference between this one and a good (expensive) bike is huge.  I had a bike shop put it together and I added a basket, so the difference between what I paid for this and what I would have paid for a good bike was about $30.  I'm kicking myself now.     
I've had my Suunto Advizor for 16 months. I am now in Iraq and the bezel is broken-off, like the other reviewer. I dont have my receipt. You can go to the Suunto website, but one thing you won't find there is an address with a note that says: "send your broken expensive plastic watch here and we will fix it."My G-shock, by comparison,lasted longer than I wanted it to and cost one-quarter of what the Suunto cost.So I give the Suunto one star, for being adventure-cool for a while. A lot of other Infantrymen own these, so I jumped on the bandwagon. I wish I had stuck with a regular watch and a GPS (with lensatic compass backup).  
 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws.  Why by a gun from these guys? If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back. Want a refund? You pay a 15% restocking fee. Take a pass on Airsplat. 
This gun is horrible. I bought this for my friend and let me tell you it was a waste of $$$. First off it is a 3/4 scale gun so it is very small and very light, if you were to drop it it would deffinitly shatter. Also the cocking system is terrible on the top there is a lever you have to pull and if pulled in the wrong spot it will snap off and then it would be useless. When we did end up shooting it the bbs wentd straight for about 5 or 10 ft then curve down, so unless you are going get within five ft of a person it is useless, even if you do get that close he wont even jump the fps is more like 270 not 370. Also the clip is an absolute pain to load first you pour all the bbs into a chamber, then you pull down a spring and shake it upsidedown fot the bbs to gome onto the front chambet then you have to release the spring and put the clip in the gun. After about 10-15 shots you have to take the clip out and repeat the process. Granted it holds 180 or so bbs you can only shoot about 15 at a time. Over all this gun STINKS. I bought it when it was originaly 100.00 but the list price was 10.00 so I thought it was going to be decent, but i was wrong. SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!!!!!
This thing is being advertised as Dance Dance Revolution.  It is NOT DDR.  It is just a cheap knock off not worth a penny.  My daughter plays a DDR at afterschool and loves it.  She received this for Christmas, tried it once and gave up within five minutes. She said, it says fifty songs but it plays just one.  Well, the 50 "songs" all sound the same.  They are not "radio" or "stereo" quality, rather just computer generated noise.  Totally awful.  Having tried it myself, I am very disappointed and don't blame my daughter for not giving it a second glance.  Total waste of money and total false advertising.  This company should be investigated.  Believe the poor reviews and skip this product!!!! 
I am not very happy with my new pedometer.  It falls off all the time, the face plate comes off and I have a very hard time making it stay back on.  The spring has now broke from the clip, so the pedometer won't even clip to my pants anymore.  I have to carry it in my pocket and it is too big for that.  I am disappointed with this purchase
these really suck i shot my lil brother in the head point blank it didnt hurt i was holding him as a hostage beacuase we play that way his teamate stuck a m16 macine gun to my head I told him to back off or ill shoot I shot and the damn bb did not come out I got a big welt on my head for 5 days and got in big troble beacuse i was trying to shot the brat
The first time I did this video I was in pain for three days. Each time I exercised to this video it got easier, but I don't have fun. I have nowhere to put the "fanny lifter" steps that I didn't realize were coming with the dvd and my boyfriend uses them as a table. If I could do it over I wouldn't buy this product, however, you will get an excellent workout. If you have more room in your house or apartment for equipment and you like an intense workout then get this video. (There is a person doing an easier workout throughout the whole video.
This ab wheel is simple to use. However, I haven't had the same results as the other reviewers.  The only place I have felt the workout is in my arms.  For a good ab workout, I would recommend buying an Ab Dolly or the video 8 Minute Abs.
I bought a GustBuster umbrella several months ago, expecting that it'd be the last umbrella I ever needed. Wow, was that a bad decision. This "windproof" umbrella had two of the spokes break in a light wind (the weather report said the winds that day were only about 15 miles per hour). So I e-mailed the company because I remembered that it had a "lifetime guarantee." They told me that I'd have to ship it back to them (which is perfectly fine), but I'd also have to pay them $10 for their trouble. What kind of lifetime guarantee is that? For $10 or less I could buy another umbrella locally. Their product has proven that it's NOT superior and it DOESN'T live up to the claims they make for it.Don't spend all this extra money on a GustBuster because you think it'll work better. It won't. Go out and buy a normal umbrella for 1/3 or 1/4 the price of a GustBuster -- you'll probably get the same amount of use out of the normal umbrella, and you won't be paying an outrageous price for something that doesn't work the way their marketing claims
This bench is a bit of a joke, unfortunately.  Having put the bench together myself, I can tell you the most flimsy part of the bench is the part you sit on:  It's particle board wrapped in thin vinyl sitting on two VERY small pieces of metal, balanced over the main structure.  I feel foolish for buying this bench.  Between the shoddy construction and the fact that the bench is supposedly rated for a MAXIMUM TOTAL WEIGHT OF 300lbs -- INCLUDING YOU AND THE WEIGHT YOU'RE LIFTING, I think it would be a mistake to purchase this.  The maximum width of this bench is only 3 feet.  It's narrow.  And small.
Received the ab roller and the box contained none of the hardware necessary for assembly.  5 days after emailing the company, they reply that they are unable to send the hardware and I must return it to them before they will send out a new box.  Very frustrating- I must drive 20 miles to the nearest UPS store to return it.Wish I had just bought the thing at Walmart
The only reason I am rating this stroller a 1 is Amazon has it listed that is usable for a child up to 100 pounds.  It actually is only 50 pounds.  It is now being returned
From the previous reviews it seems that this product doesn't deliver any satisfaction at all. Buy instead the wrist roller manufactured by proboxinggear.I bought one eight months ago and I loved it. I use it at home and even at the gym, since it is small and very light, so it fits in my backpack taken about the same space than my gloves.The one I bought is really an excellent accessory, since is not only a Wrist exerciser, but a complete Forearm Strengthener. Simple to use, with no spring or moving or breakable parts, it looks like it will resist the hardest workouts and continuous use.With simple rolling movements and as you gradually increase resistance by adding weight plates to it you strengthen hands, wrist, forearms and upper arms. I have considerably improved wrist stability and holding power, and also feel an Increased range of motion and flexibilit
The set is fine, however the crate was completely busted up.  I will think twice before I order an item so heavy for it was not packed well at all.  I was going to try and get a refund, but I am not going to pay to have it returned.  However, if the "Powers that be" might receive this e-mail - a new crate or bag would be wonderful.  An Amazon Patron,Iri
This stand is very bad quality. Not worth investing in this stand. The speed bag platform isnt even made out of real wood. It vibrates too much! The Swivel it comes with is made out of plastic! It Sucks! Invest in a better stand like the ones from www.balazsboxing.co
The design of the bed is awesome.  Unfortunately it would not hold air.  There were no visible flaws.  The instructions state that the bed will need additonal air after the bed is originally used.  The bed would not hold air at all.  (I only attempted to use it in the house and checked for possible problems there 1st)I purchased another bed assuming that the 1st bed had a flaw and the second one did exactly the same thing.  I love the design but I am disappointed in the quality
I expected much better quality from Thule. As used according to the manufacturers recomendations, this bag did not even last one trip from New York to Chicago without it's interior lining cracking and completely flaking off. In addition, the back of the bag ripped creating two large holes in the fabric and the zipper attachments became loose and proceeded to pound at the roof of my car. The contents shifted continually during travel making for a loud noise that's not unlike a pouring rain hitting the top of the car. This becomes a terrible distraction while driving. All in all I had a very bad experience with this product and would not reccomend it. Opt for one of the solid constuction type carriers, they cost much more, but are worth every penny. In the end I thought I was saving money with this product but wound up having to purchase a Sears X-Cargo container to replace it for my return trip back.
Basically, I ordered my racket on the 11 and got my racquet in 3 weeks! That was really long, especially because I upgraded my shippping. I dont' like this because the grip isn't really grippy (lol) and the strings make your hands hurt because they're kinda loose. The only thing I like about this is that it donates to breast cancer, but I really don't recommend this raquet. I bought an N-code right after I tried to use this 3 times. Very unsatisfied. This wilson doesn't live up to the wilson reputation for m

Don't buy these cards. They are of very low quality. I bought 4 decks -- several cards in each deck where visibly marked. You will be better off paying a few dollars more for high-quality cards.
i was JUST LOOKING at tennis rackets, on the amazon site. the next thing i get is an email to say i have agreed to purchase one.i did NOT press to conferm this order, but AMAZON kept my credit card details on record and used them.nicola bradle
I ordered several of these tables as Christmas presents, two of five arrived broken. Both of the broken tables had broken slats in the top and one also had a broken bracket on one of the legs. The tops are made out of a brittle plastic, spend more money and order a table with a metal top
My husband bought this for me for Christmas after we both had looked at reviews and decided it was a great product. I used it for 5 months with no problems other than the squeaky sound everyone talks about. Then, without warning, the bolt securing the cable to the right pedal popped off. When my husband called the company, he was told that the parts (including the pedal and cable) were only guaranteed for 90 days, and the frame for 3 years. In other words, there was nothing they would do about it. When I called, they told me that they could replace the entire stepper free of charge, but I would have to pay shipping and handling. That was today, I'm still awaiting a call back from the supervisor about the s&h reimbursement. This gave me a great workout so I was disappointed to find out it was defective enough to break after 5 months of use by a 120 lb woman (and I only used it about 3x per week). I'm hoping that this was a fluke as only one other review in this set currently states the same problem... and I'm hoping the company has the decency to replace their defective product
I am a personal trainer and I was asked by a friend to check this "elliptical" strider out for them.  I was suspicious from the price thinking that it really couldn't be an elliptical machine but checked it out anyway.  As I suspected, this is simply a glider similar to what was on infomercials years ago. Except for the Tony Little TV glider most of those 20 or more gliders that were on the market are all gone. There is a simple reason that true elliptical machines are so popular in health clubs and that there are NO gliders in health clubs. With ellipticals and treadmills users lift their legs with each stride which of course is more like the natural motion of walking and running.  This of course engages many more muscles than the gliding or swinging machines of the past. Also ellipticals have a flywheel to allow the user to add resistance while still keeping a smooth motion. I've read the other reviews of this machine and realize that certainly any movement is better compared to doing nothing.  But it is a question of time.  You could swing on one of these machines for hours and while it might be kind of fun for some people it will never come close to a true elliptical.  I'm not promoting any one brand and I have no ax to grind, except that it is somewhat annoying when companies like Sharper Image continue to intentionally mislead the public because they know it sells products. The reason elliptical machines are called "elliptical" is that the user's foot goes through an elliptical path.  Gliders just swing back and forth like a pendulum.  If you don't believe me ask any trainer or exercise physiologist.  This is misleading marketing and no doubt they know they are using that name to cash in on the popularity of the real ellipticals.  My advice to my friend was to save a little more money and get an elliptical. 
your money could be well spent on something other than this, not any better than a regular pair of gloves you can buy at wal-mart
I enjoy the elliptical.. i really do, especially when I first received the box. It had NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL!!! how da heck do you expect someone to put this together!
This was a horrible product, it was difficult to manuever and control. It did nothing but immediately cause my arms, shoulders and wrists to hurt. I felt absolutely nothing at all in the target area, my stomach. Not even a little. It was boring and pointless to bother.This machine was a waste of time to ship back and forth and I do not recomend it to anyone who wants to work their stomach muscles. Its a misleading product and very uncomfortable on the back also. It hurt my spine to bend in the way they said. I felt the machine digging into my spine. I was so focused on the pain and the pain in my arms I could not continue for more than 5 minutes at a time. Dont waste your time buying this product. Its expensive and not worth it.
Bought this for my son.  He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week.  Then the wheels broke.  He wasn't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway.  The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable
like most weight loss product these were a wate of money.on the plus side they did a fair job a suppressing my appitite but I did not lose even an ounce.No side effects either no head aches or shakes.
All this air pump does is let out what little air may be in your tyres.  I can't think of anything else I have ever bought that was as completely useless as this. It is a toy, pretending to be an air pump.  The nonfunctional lever on the top (mentioned by other reviewers) indicates that it was designed as a toy.  I'm just happy I was trying to put air in my tyres in the driveway, not out on a trail.  In the past, I have bought a number of Bell products, including motorcycle helmets.  I now shudder to think what might have happened if I had put one of them to the test
I have had two of these units (SG2 and an SG4) and all I can say is "don't believe the hype".  While the units are an unbelievable concept on TV and work (NOTE: WHEN THEY WORK) great, the lack of computer knowledge and the unbelievably awful customer service provided by Skygolf is, by itself, sufficient reason to choose another product in this arena.Just to relay my experience (and keep in mind I have 15 years in the high technology industry to leverage open when attempting to set-up these units), it took almost six hours on the phone to set-up my original SG2 and even then it was constantly destabilizing my system software (ie-endless restarts).When the SG2 was stolen at an event, I purchased an SG4 to obtain the next generation of the product.  Since the January 2, 2007, purchase date, I have been on the phone with no less than eight customer service representatives for a total amount of time approaching ten hours (including one Saturday morning, prior to a Sunday event, when they requested I attend a conference call regarding my unit at 5AM (NO, that is not a typing error on my part!) California time).  I have purchased/received (Skygolf sent me one unit from their headquarters out of desperation) and returned three SG4s at various points in the process to ensure that the units were not damaged.  I have attempted to download the software and access the website via the SG4 on five different computers and EVERY SINGLE SERVICE PACK OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 2000.  Even after I forwarded Skygolf the computer log to show them the problem (software error) neither the software developers nor the customer service department could figure out what was wrong and the units were never operational.At this point, all I can say is what a complete and utter waste of time this process has been and how frustrating (to echo another review) it is to deal with the people behind the product.No product, no matter how fabulous in concept, is worth this level of incompetence during set-up and operation.Good luck to you if you purchase the product.  I hope your experience is better than mine.
The leather/pleather outting of the glove is soo thin that if you plan on doing any sparring plan on it tearing.  I used them once and tearing occured during padwork and sparring.  I would recomend getting a glove with a thick leather so you know that it will last through the beatings
Don't buy this compass if you need to know any direction. If you know about where the sun sets, you will be more accurate than this "compass." It is impossible to use in the field. A waste of money: inaccurate to the max, impossible to maintain it level, etc. Just junk. They should give them away
Just to warn you, this product does not come with a USB cable and it doesn't work with most laptops I have had.  You need a desktop for this product and the website for the product is not very helpful at all.  The ecaddy is great, but the caddylink is next to worthless
I tried this on the day I got it to see how it felt.  The velcro is so strong that when I tried to take it off, the velcro ripped the top layer of the material right off.  I would not advise buying this.  I was dissappointed in the quality of this product.
The console that came with mine is broken...so I haven't been able to use it.  I have been told by the customer support people @ Schwinn/Bowflex - since the middle of February - that a replacement is on it's way (even the "supervisor" said this to me).  Hear that ticking?  Yeah, that's the clock on my warranty - it is just going away without ever even getting a chance to try the thing out.  Am I happy...NO!!  Maybe I'll write another review when I get my new console and I can tell you how wonderful this piece of equipment is - until then - I'm one heck of a ticked off customer.  Save yourself the headache and just go to the gym
The item was broken when I received it. Also, It is not what the picture looked liked. Very poorly made
The IR link for the Polar hear monitors is great.  It allows you to transfer data 2 ways from your PC:  you can download your exercise data, and also change the settings for the watch from the computer.  This is great, because it means no scrolling through abbreviations on the watch with the tiny buttons.The biggest problem with the IR link is the driver that needs to be installed on your computer.  For whatever reason, Polar decided not to pay Bill Gates to get the software recognized as being compatible with Microsoft.  When installing the driver from the included CD, warnings and error messages pop up to discourage you from proceeding, which will compromise all security and firewall features that you might have.  There is no updated version available for download from the internet.  I went ahead and installed the driver, but since doing so, the computer has not been functioning properly, and I've been getting those "send error report / don't send error report" pop-ups from Windows.  Polar denies responsibility and insists that their driver is "fine" for use.  I'm no computer expert, so I don't know for sure, but I don't believe them
I wouldn't recommend this shuffler to anyone.  It shuffles more from one side than the other.  When through shuffling on the left side the right side is only half through.  The cards will jam in the tray stopping the rest of the cards from coming down.  The switch just works part time, you have to stop and restart several times
1. Calories shown during a workout are about 1.5 to 2 times actual.   I do have the right weight entered in my user profile.2. Machine broke right after warranty ran out.   No manual. No reasonable support. I paid $850, including shipping.   It is now sitting in my bedroom in a state of partial disassembly.   Nothing about fixing this is intuitive. Some of the nuts and screws    are so tightly put on, you cannot budge them.I am going to throw this junk out and buy a non-schwinn elliptical thathas a better warranty and real servicabilty. Customer support at 1-800-864-1270 is practically useless.Save you rmoney. Buy something else
I was hoping to get a water bottle that was leak proof and would not sweat. I got neither. It is pretty , but that is about it.
Most enthusiastic cyclists and bike shop clerks I talked to dislike this product. I've used it a number of times myself and I would never use it again (especially after I discovered better products). It turns your chain and drive train into a black mess. Finish Line was better. TriFlow was recommended by a number of cyclists.
This watch has a great look and much potential 'under the hood', but I am having to return mine because of a defective altimeter - it gives readings of up to 1000ft difference in altitude over the course of a few days in the same location during the same kind of weather. I was also disappointed to find that the alarm was barely audible - certainly not loud enough to get my attention if it is under my sleeve - and the metal finish of the watch and band is extremely scratch-prone. I cannot recommend this watch for the price it sells for, even if the altimeter worked correctly.
I only had the gazelle for one month when the noise began. It started as a low annoying squeak but gradually the noise increased to the point where it is difficult to hear anything else. Very annoying! Also, the calorie monitor is no where near accurate and the heart rate monitor is worse. While it is a low impact machine, it strains the ball of the foot because of the awkward angle of the pedals. This is not the machine to get if you want any sort of a workout. I am selling mine and buying an elliptical machine. Do not waste your money
The pogo stick that I ordered was not the same one that was sent to me in he mail.  I have to say though that the return was easy.  The company had UPS come to my house and pick up the product and I was given a full refund immediatly.  The item was not great...but customer service was good
Other buyers have warned me that these cards are cheap for a reason. Over 65% of the decks are marked and unusable. That means that at most 25 of the 72 decks will be OK for poker play (unless you're lucky). I have purchase casino used cards before and honestly, they are not worth the trouble
Please advise me if I can get a new Plu in senor Temp wire plug in this item come in defective and dont work? Please advise ASAP ThanksWalter Ga
This case is mainly MADE OF PLASTIC!!  Don't be fooled by the "aluminum" description, only the corners were aluminum, the rest just PAINTED PLASTIC.  The case came poorly packaged!  The box was too small for the case.  The case had scuff marks, and scratches on it.  Obviously NOT BRAND NEW!!  This was the worst purchase I've ever made on amazon.  Will never buy ADG SPORTS again!!!  Their label was crooked on the case too!!  Looks like a 4-year-old put it on!!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  TRUST ME!!
This backpack is a great size but the zippers are nylon and are already separating and getting stuck, it would have been better with metal zipper
My little girl was supposed to get this bike for her birthday (8/28) and due to missing parts. I was under the impression that i was buying a new bike not a used one. For the price i paid i should have gotten a new bike not a used bike that no one wanted. We have been having to go and order parts for the bike. The bike came with scratches and the bottles of paint that came with it were all dried out. The box that the bike came in was in horrible condition, it seemed as if it was left out in the rain for about a year. Then someone tried to tape the box together and ran out of tape. There were holes all over the place and i can see why i am missing most of the bolts and nuts.We were very disatified and when i called to complain the girl who answered hung up on me. I am very unhappy and this will problaly be my last order with this comapny.
If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions. One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still.As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me, I urge you to buy something else
I was disappointed in this product, and returned it - and bought "crank" type no-battery flashlights instead.  There were two things I disliked about the Diamond flashlight.  First, the light lasted a very short time - after shaking vigorously for a couple of minutes (they recommend just 90 sec. for a full charge), I turned the light on, and in less than 5 minutes it was very dim and almost useless.  I tried this a couple of times, with the same results.  The other problem was that shaking it for 90 sec. turns out to be a LOT more work than you would think!  I am much happier with both the light output and the ease of use with the crank type flashlights I replaced these with
Bought this for my son.  He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week.  Then the wheels broke.  He wasn't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway.  The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable
I ordered a wobble balance board from Everyting Fitness and it came from Karate Depot and doesn't even look like the product I ordered.  I only give 1 star, because I can't give zero starts
This is a very heavy machine so make sure you have help if it is going up the stairs.  It is fairly quiet, not silent.  It is shakier than I had hoped.  The wire to the monitor came broken. 
I got this item to give a a gift.  I got it fast, however opened the bag to find out the zipper was completely broken.  It wasn't worth returning it because if you've opened it you can only get a 50% refund and have to pay shipping, which would have cost more than what I would have been refunded.  Don't bother with this one
The goal arrived at my house assembled wrong, then after it was fixed be me, I successfully put it together, which was relativly easy.  After several moderately hard training sessions two large holes were in the net.  That is on top of the fact that the pins that hold the net together are weak.  The weakness in the pins causes the goal to collapse if there is a shot off of the post.  Overall, this is probably not a good buy.
It holds my bike but seems unstable - I still can't figure out where all 6 straps go on my car, and the support rails tilt downward towards the rear instead of upwards.  Plus, probably the biggest concern - there is no means of strapping the bike to the rack (user must tie the bike down every time).  My bike hasn't fallen off though..
how can this table be used with FACE HOLE?either -- 1) use no sheets, ie client lies directly on vinyl,   or 2) fitted sheet covers hole, ie client cannot breathe.Neither of these 2 options is even remotely acceptable
 I received the exercise bike, put it together as soon as I got it,  and started using it. Just looking at it I had second thoughts about buying it. Ten minutes later it broke. Some part in this cheaply made product broke on the inside. I contacted the guys who sold this to me to get my money back but they never got back to me. One more thing. Even if it hadn't broken, the resistance setting on this thing is horrible. You get absolutely no resistance on it. That means no workout
The others summed it up.  Cheap parts, difficult to adjust. Put your money towards the EZ Rip instead. Costs more but much better results
My daughter has an earlier version that the one shown so it is possible they have addressed some of these issues:1) most games have a 1 minute time out which is really frustrating for my kids2) "Oh that's not so good" - If I hear Barbie say that one more time I may just throw this thing out the nearest window.  My daughter will get a score in a game she feels really good about and barbie says, "Oh that's not so good, but you'll be better with a bit more practice"  This has broken my daughter down into tears more than once.3) There are no parental controls.  I wanted to turn off or lengthen the timer.  I expected those sorts of features from Oregon Scientific.  Right now the most fun thing my kids do with it is play the Flower Fun game (like hangman) and type in "ICUP"If you are looking at a newer version of this I would strongly recommend playing with a demo for a few minutes to check it out
This game is for people to play if they're drunk or mindless...or in some cases both....it's completely pointless and uninteresting...if ur just going to play bunco to see if u can get 21 snake eyes you either love to waste time or are just stupid...sorry but i mean think about it?...why PAY MONEY for this when i can JUST USE DICE from OTHER MORE INTERESTING board games I already own? DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!~*Even if you manage to make the game interesting by being creative and thinking a little...you still shouldn't buy it...b/c like i said before JUST USE DICE FROM OTHER BOARD GAMES YOU ALREADY OWN!
I was really excited about this toy because it was a stacking and sorting toy in one. And I love Laugh and Learn toys. I got it for my daughter for christmas when she was 16 months old. She never liked it. I kept it out and encouraged her to play with it, but she just really didn't get into it. Also, there is a sticker that goes on the bottom of the top pot so you can see the shapes through the holes on the lid, and the sticker shapes don't match the holes! Unfortunately, this toy was a big let down.
It seems like a nice complete set of playfood, except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard, and I've thrown most of them out already.  It doesn't take much to crush them.  There are much nicer sets out there, and there are separate pieces sold on ebay, that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better.  Not worth the money
I got this puzzle for my three children (age 5, 4, and 2) and within a day my 2 year old had chewed off enough of the little black rubber pieces that the toy no longer worked.  It requires two of them for the vehicles to make sounds, so removing one means it doesn't work.  The pieces are small enough that I wasn't very worried about choking, but why buy a toy which makes you worry?  We were really disappointed.  
This was very cheaply made.  I was disappointed in it's quality.  Also, it comes apart constantly.  All my daughter has to do is barely touch it and it comes all apart.  I am going to try to glue the pieces in place so she can at least play with it.  We have many Barbie toys and this is by far the worst I have ever purchased.  Not to mention that is was expensive!  I expected much, much better quality from a Barbie product
Was a lot smaller than I expected. My daughter had to find a small doll to use that would fit. Because she couldn't use her best baby doll that she loves to play with she lost interest real quick
My son loved this tent.  He fit perfectly in it and it fits inside his crib so he can sleep in his tent.  My only beef with it is that somehow he's bent the frame of it so now it doesn't sit right on the floor.  Actually it doesn't sit on the floor at all because of where it's bent.  The tent would be better made if there were a floor to it and some support (similar to what keeps the top portion rigid) at the base of it to keep the "legs" (there aren't any but that's the best way to describe them) apart.  The tent would also be better constructed if it didn't have one continuous wire for the frame on each side.  If the wire gets bent there's no getting it back into its original shape, unless you take out the stitching (around the WHOLE tent frame) and repair it then restitch it, but who has that kind of time?  Overall it's a fun toy for a little one but not a well thought out build.  I'm glad we got it as a gift and it wasn't something we spent our money on
This was a cute product, but only lasted a day.  Perhaps my preschool boys' punches were just too much for this bag.  A patch was included, but it seems that air is leaking from the seams.  Oh well.
While my son enjoyed the illustrations anf fun content of the books in this set, I felt it was disappointing as a learning tool for beginning readers because it moves much too quickly.  The first book is just letters and letter sounds.  Very introductory.  The second book introduces three letter words right off with no transition at all like 2 letter blends.  That was ok to me since it was phonetic 3 letter words, but by page 2 we were already "leaping" to 4 and 5 letter words and by page 3 they were already introducing a sight word - "does" and a double consonant word - "cannot".  I thought the pace was frustrating for my son.  I was hoping/expecting a book devoted to just blends and/or 3 letter words.  Instead this program is organized by vowels with the letter a being introduced first.  I don't see that as a problem, but I was expecting more phonetic 3 letter words to start and introducing harder 4 and 5 letter words by maybe book 3 and sight words coming later, like maybe book 4.  Unfortunately, you can't see exactly what your getting until you open the box.Nonetheless, the audio is entertaining for children with music and humor thrown in and the reward stickers, poster, and ribbon are a fun way to recognize your child's achievement.  The practice game is basically just like the Word Whammer Fridge Phonics product but with cards instead of magnets
This appealed to me since I would be able to use it longer than the standard mobile, but it ended up not working when we wanted it to anyways.  I liked to idea, but just doesn't work.  This mobile constantly stops working (before the 8 minutes are up)...it stops going round.  The music continues & the lights are still on, but the base stops rotating, it seems as though it always gets "stuck" and we have to push it to get "unstuck".  We've changed the battery and that doesn't seem to help as the base keeps getting stuck, I contacted Mattel to get a voucher since it's been more than 90 days since I bought this, can't return it in the store.  (It's kind of big and ugly too, didn't expect that from the picture.
We are very disappointed in this product we purchased last summer.  We constantly have many kids and adults of all ages over to our house because of our swimming pool and I don't think we have found one person who has done more than try it once then walk away.  Also it is difficult to find the right size to hang it becasue of different sized people using it.  Not recommended
I purchased bean bag toss for my four year old grandson, it was his birthday, it was absolutely no challenge - no fun and required absolutely no dexterity.   very very disappointed, if it was possible to return it I woul
I had a feeling that this toy would be trouble when I saw the delivery guy walking up to our front steps with a weird grin on his face.  Evidently, the box had been vrooming, vibrating and shrieking throughout his rounds, and he was only too glad to end his term as its temporary steward.  My two-year-old has largely lost interest in this toy; he doesn't mind the shaking and noise, but more often than not it just vrooms and then doesn't go anywhere.  My advice: buy Matchbox, or Hot Wheels...or something more reliable with volume control. This will probably be in our next load of donations...thrift shoppers beware.  
I have been searching for the perfect handheld sudoku game and this is not it.  I found it very difficult to see the numbers without a backlight even with my reading glasses.  Also I would perfer a stylus pen instead of having to scroll around the screen to enter a number.  I do like the idea of being able to use a dry erase pen to mark off numbers, but I couldn't even see those.  Still searching
I have a BIG Dora fan in my house & this was one of her first Dora dolls (last year). She played with it for the first day or two...its loud, very mechanical, not very appealing. The toy saw a rebirth in use when it was discovered that it she could make Dora dance & terrorize the puppy. The doll only does one dance, regardless of what skirt she has on now. From reading other reviews, if I pushed & held it while she was wearing it she might ballet, but not worth the hassle! Since then, my Dora lover has received various other Dora dolls, so we have a collection that sings, dances, speaks various languages, and the ONLY one she plays with regularly is the Dress Up Adventure Dora - she's more posable, does something other than sing, and you can change her outfits. Perfect for my almost 5 year old
This product is terrible. The very essence of Su Doku is logic & reasoning. This product leaves everything to guesswork. I returned it, ate the postage, & was happy to be rid of it! I then downloaded shareware from the Palm Store to my Palm Pilot for $10. Couldn't be happier
This is a very cute and realistic set.  The measurements are all accurate.  The whisk is very DANGEROUS though.  It is metal.  One of the "things" came out of the handle and stuck out like a weapon.  One of the kids could have been severely injured had I not found it and thrown it away.  If you buy this item, make sure get rid of the whisk!
I read all the negative reviews on this table and decided to go ahead and order hoping I would get lucky and not have all the problems the other customers had. DON'T DO IT! The table arrived poorly packaged and beat up just as the others here have described. One corner of the table top was bashed in, another piece of wood was split, the green paint from the table top rubbed off onto the white table leg, and edge of the other table leg was dented in revealing the plywood underneath the paint. This is a very CHEAP table - cheaply constructed of plywood. It is functional, but just not very attractive since it arrives already damaged. Just beware before you buy that you will more than likely be getting a banged up train table
We got this set for my 4 year old son for Christmas. His eyes lit up when he saw it. He dropped everything and insisted that we open it right away....we didn't, of course...we waited a whole day...thank goodness...it literally took an hour to put together. There are so many pieces that look alike but are barely different. It was very frustrating...then it wouldn't stay together once it was finished. It has been nothing but a frustration for him and me ever since. He gets so upset when he tries to play with it. We saved the box. It's going back, if they will take it...
I ordered this item and was so excited. It loaded fine. It let me upload files just fine. It wasn't until I actually tried to create my PVD that I received errors that shut down the program (many many many times...with numerous types of video files) I double checked the system requirements for the software and my computer checked out fine. The worst thing is that there is no support for the media player. I tried contacting Hasbro with no response. I am so dissapointed.
My daughter had this when she was a teenager. Now my grandchildren come and play the game she had. To preserve the original game I ordered new ones to replace my daughters game when she had it. The grandchildren, all 6 of them, love playing this game at our house
The game was not nearly as sturdy as I had hoped.  A piece broke off as I was putting it together.  Too sensitive to touch.  Wouldn't purchase again for an 8 year old
My 3 year old got this for a Christmas gift, and I thought it to be a great idea, since he loves Elmo and bathtime.  WRONG...  the darn crayons stained my bathtub!!  I had to scrub my tub for what seemed like forever to get the stains "almost" out.  I threw the crayons away after that.  My son likes the Elmo still, but I wouldn't recommend the crayons, especially in an older-style porcelain bathtub, like ours
My daughter has the ethnic version of this doll.  She absolutely loves it.  However, as a parent I notice that the color on the lips are peeling and the doll cheeks has no color to them like the illustration.  I am also very upset that I can not get a replacement for this item.  How do you tell your daughter that Santa Claus can't fix or replace this item?
My four year old picked this toy out with a gift certificate given to him by his grandmother.  He already had pirate sets made by Playmobil, but this looked like an interesting addition to the sets.  Well, set up took nearly an hour for his very mechanically able father, and almost as soon as he began to play with it, pieces fell apart.  NOTE:  he is NOT a careless child, nor is he rough with toys.  But this toy doesn't stand up to even the most basic four year old play.   After he had had it up without playing with it for six months, we finally just boxed it.  We found all the parts and sold it for five dollars at a garage sale.  I just hope those people don't come back to reclaim their money.  Save yourself the pain and frustration and buy Playmobil's Pirate Lagoon -- this is just a cheap knockoff
Unless you buy the multi arcade machines with all the major games including Mr. Do and do it right- the classic collections on PlayStation II are the best.  Unfortunately for plug and play some of the versions are jerked to very difficult levels and not as fun to play.  The monsters in the Pac-Man games are almost always on kill including following you  in the tunnel a lot of the time.  The problems listed with the joystick seem to be accurate.  Galaga was better and Mappy was a lot of fun to play- the most underated classic in arcade history.  But again it's better to get the collections for Playstation II
After receiving, putting together and using this toy with myself and children, I overestimated what it would be.  I remember the old school Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, and this product isn't even close.  The old characters stood 6-8" tall and both necks sprung up with metal parts when a blow to the head was delivered.  This version has only plastic parts, the characters are 4" tall at best, and the 'win' is from a blow to the chest, not the head.  Metallo's head springs up, but Superman's head only nods backward.  It is difficult to discern the 'winner' from the set up.  It was only an $11 lesson for me to learn, but if you truly want a real Rock 'em set, try eBay, or yard sales.  This replica is not comparable to the original
Rainbow fish has colorful shiny scales.  He is shamed into giving them to everyone.  Sounds like a communist primer
We purchased this for our 3 year old daughter who loves the Disney princesses.  Even though we purchased it as a "play" bed we soon realized the poor design with the unsecured sides could be a hazard for any child.  We immediately returned the item and warned the store clerk on how dangerous the bed could be.   It's not worth the risk of suffocation for an air bed that probably wouldn't last long anyway.  I recommend you look else where for your child's princess dreams
I had searched high and low via the internet trying to find the perfect baby doll pram.  Good quality material, well made and if possible fold away storage ability.  When I found the Corolle Pram /Carriage I thought I found it plus the added bonus of a adjustable handle so no matter how tall my grand daughter was she could push her babies.  But when it arrived I was not thrilled.  What looked good on paper was not so in life.  True it folds away to store in a closet no problem.  But this ability is to easy and I fear the child will pinch her fingers.  All that keeps the stroller in an up right position in 2 lame flip over metal rings.  Now with the wonderful way a simple umbrella stroller for a real baby folds way, why wasn't this technology used on this product.  Sure an adult would have to fold it up, but I would feel better if that was the case then a 4 year old maybe getting broken fingers.  Also the cute canopy.  It does not stay on if you even move it to open a tiny bit.  I spent $113.00 on this item thinking I was getting a well put together item that would last years for my grand daughter.  Only way that will happen is if I can weld parts together and forget about ever wanting to store it.  I did not buy this from Amazon only cause I wanted it right away and so bought it from another shop.  But I knew Amazon would have this forum and wanted to make sure others did not waste their money on this product.  Go with the other one for $33 at least maybe it will stay together.  Now I have to hope I can return this thing to where I bought it.  But I think Corolle should either rethink this items design or just pull it from the stores.  It's not what a good parent would want for their child.  Thanks & I hoped this helped
Good luck getting this bed! I ordered it 5 months ago (with availability being 2-4 weeks. Each month I was told it will available "next month." I finally cancelled my order and purchased the Little Tykes one before my frustrated 3 yr. old outgrows a toddler bed. Kidkraft needs to focus more on actually manufacturing their products and less on marketing for orders they are unable to fulfill
I am a seamstress who knows how to sew, and how to thread both top and bobbin threads.  My daughter received this machine for Christmas.  We threaded it according to directions.  It sews about 10 stitches then jams.  I observe that the bobbin design is such that the bobbin wobbles within the casing, and leads to a jam every time.  Don't disappoint a child by purchasing this
Not only do you use chocolate syrup which runs off of the cookies, pretzels, strawberries, etc., but it doesn't even warm up the syrup. So, like someone else said, you may as well fill up a bowl with Hershey's syrup and let the kids dip away.  The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because my kids did seem to have a really good time playing with this.  They thought it was great even though it was cold syrup instead of warm chocolate
I should have paid attention to the reviewer who stated this doll is a "piece of junk" and the only good thing is how the doll is dressed!Being optimistic, after the first purchase of the doll proved to be disappointing (she laughs adorably; she makes the sucking noise; she makes a contented sound, which becomes 'stuck' and the mechanism on her back must be turned off; she does not kick her legs; she does not close her eyes when rocked) I purchased a second doll and this doll was lessfunctional than the first one. The second doll cries continually. She does close her eyes and that's it! I returned the second one and kept the first one because she is more functional. DON'T WASTE YOUR DOLLARS ON THIS ONE
This toy is not good at all! its hard for the reflecters to stay still and to connect. its hard to trace the picture because you can hardly see your hand! plus it the picture moves, thats it! you have to start all over again. its better if you just take a piece a paper and putting it over the picture and traceing it that way, trust me i ended up just doing that
My 15 month old daughter received this as a gift, and I have to admit she loves it, but it has nothing to do with the product design. She would love any toy shopping cart at this stage. She just loves pretend cooking, eating, and feeding her baby doll. This toy is so shoddily made it's laughable. Some of the included foods to put in the cart are actually just cardboard boxes that wind up torn and in the garbage within the first 48 hours. The cart basket is too small, the baby gets stuck in the seat, and my daughter gets frustrated when parts of the cart fall off as she plays. It's not going to last long. The best parts are the little milk carton and the banana.Check out other shopping cart toys (little tykes or small world toys).  We bought her a set of wooden fruit (melissa and doug). When this shopping cart dies, we'll buy her a sturdy one and add more wooden food toys (there are some excellent sets available). My advice is skip this one and buy your child something better the first time around
While the doll is beautiful, I don't think she is a good representation of Chinese people because if you look at the picture of a close up of her face, you can see that her eyes are big and round just like a European. Her nose also is upturned.While some may say that some Asians do have rounder eyes, most do not and I don't think this doll looks Chinese enough
Since purchasing this "Executive" set, I have purchased another one at a local store.  Although both sets are relatively the same, the instruction package with my second set is much better.  The sea monkeys in the "Executive" set lasted about a month and a half.  This was due to the fact that the instructions on how to care for them were very vague.  We did not know that you needed to add air to the water or that over feeding was extremely bad for them.  The instructions in the sea monkey set we bought locally were very good and we have now had sea monkeys for over 3 months.  I believe the "Executive" set is overpriced as well
Over Priced, Cheaply made, Bad assembly instructions.It's a good Idea, but a bad product. Very over priced. I would not have mined losing out on ten dollars, but 50 plus shipping is a lot. This was the most expensive toy I bought my son for Christmas. The bat does not fully swing, because one of the guides block it. you can't control the so called pitching, the ball is a magnet that sticks to the playing field. pitch it to the bat and it may not roll to the bat, hit it and it may not make it out of the out field. Score board dials won't stay attached to the paper score board. It takes two people to operate. it's the day after Christmas and this one is going to the trash. I can't send it back because I have attempted to assemble it. It would have to go back in the same condition it was received. I would not recommended this to anyone. My son and I are both very disappointed.
My 4-yr old daughter really wanted this for Christmas, and Santa was kind enough to bring it for her.  The quality is fine, but it just doesn't do much.  She played with it for the first day, and has touched it maybe twice since.  I've seen these on clearance everywhere I've gone lately, too.  If your child is into playing "mommy", this is cute, but the extra money you pay for something that moves and talks doesn't really equate to lasting play value with this one
As stated by the other parents on this item this belt is a cute idea, but it is so small it barely fits my [...]. It will only fit him if he is not wearing a shirt and even then if he bends down it sometimes pops off. He gets very frustrated and so am I. If I have to re-velcro this thing again I am going to scream, and he only got it this morning for easter. I called fisher-price but they are closed for the holiday...I plan on calling again tomorrow and I WILL be getting some sort of refund....hey maybe I can score a free Field Journal. HAHA... Good Luck To You All.
Here's a quick primer for parents looking to buy science kits for the early grade school set (i.e., K - 3rd).  Every science kit, including this one, basically tells you to mix vinegar with baking soda and "Voila!" you made a volcano.  Nevermind that in later years some kid will go hiking in the crater of Mt. St. Helen's during an eruption thinking it is just harmless cooking products.  Use safe chemicals to make scientific changing colors? You guessed it -- food dye.  All these kits basically include a set of plastic test tubes and instructions telling you to open your kitchen cupboards.  Back in the Middle Ages people who sold this kind of hokum for the price it now commands were called alchemists.  They eventually went out of business.  Buy the kid a Suzukie violin or a football helmet instead
Great company - Terrible toy.  My daughter got this toy for Christmas and waited all day for daddy to bring home the 4 C batteries which were not included.  She was excited until we turned it on.  1) the frame is not secure and will open when you reach into the middle to change the picture disk.  2) the light is not very bright and will not work in mid-day light. 3) the image is quite small - only takes up the middle 3 inches of the paper - not even close to what is pictured on the box.  4) the clamps that hold the paper are not easy for tiny fingers to use.  5) because the small picture is in the middle of the page and the clamps are on the far edges, you can't shift the paper to re-use the paper.  You get one tiny picture in the middle of standard size piece of paper and its a waste.  The chalk board was fine - but the whole piece slides across the table when you push to draw.  Big disappointment.Get some washable markers and some tracing paper and don't waste your money on this suprisingly junky toy
Ok so my daughter was 2 3/4 and not 3 (toy rated for age 3), but she loves Elmo and loves playing with this toy. It is somewhat loud an there is no volume control. Also after 4 months of use the pen stopped working, rendering the toy worthless. Also the binding is weak and my daughter has torn the sheets with normal use. So fun toy while it lasts
Extremely disappointing. Bought the toy for my son for Christmas. It didn't come with the battery ($30 extra) and the battery is still sold out everywhere, including online, almost a month later. Don't bother. There are lots of other great RC toys out there
What a disaster.  It takes too long.  Then you get a tiny gross little blob of "cotton candy".  It is quite a mess to clean.  Then the kids will cry because it is not at all what they expect and are so disappointed.  My 5 year old wants to know how Santa's elves made such a "stinky, bad toy".  Expect to be disappointed with this one
I loved the concept of the markers. However they have left a greasy stain on my daughters clothing!! The package said that they didn't stain! I called and they gave me a long process to try and remove including Tide with Bleach..Is that one of their subsidiaries? I was very disappointed
This product is a waste of time! Don't bother. The handheld game is entertaining for my daughter, but connecting it online via the website is frustrating to say the least! Once connected, we walked around the "virtual world" with nothing to do. It is too complicated for my 8 yr old to do alone. There are much better products out there for children that are similar, but easier to play with. I would suggest Webkinz or Neopets. These 2 sites are very kid friendly and have educational games to play, unlike the Muichiz site! Good luck..
All the above comments are SO TRUE! I can't believe the prices on Amazon. I too have been running back and forth to Walmart, Kohls, KB Toys trying to get the whole collection. I Am also missing Chick.. But, I won't resort to these tactics. The normal selling price is $3.99 - these sellers should be ashamed!!!
I bought LeapPad Plus Writing on impulse at the store, wanting to help my son with writing, phonics, etc.He used it a few times, but I almost have to beg for him to use it...and that's sad. I wish I would have gotten the original LeapPad or perhaps even the Leapster. For one thing, the book doesn't recognize all pencil movements. A child could make an incorrect number or letter, and it doesn't seem that the LeapPad would recognize it. Also, the child has to keep erasing over and over, providing limited usage.Not only that, there are only a few books published with LeapPad Writing in mind, and the exercises are repetitive (e.g. writing the number 6 ten times).I've bought quite a few LeapPad books and Quantum Pad books for my son, and he is just not interested after initial use. I'm sure he's learned a little bit of phonics using the phonics books and such, but I think he learns more from workbooks bought at a bookstore or a department store--and they're cheaper! Not only that LeapPad books are very short...much shorter than workbooks you can buy.Considering that LeapPad books are usually around $15 a pop--and that Amazon doesn't carry/list them all and there is a VERY limited selection in Stuff Mart-type stores (at least, that's the case in my geographical area)--you may want to re-consider investing in the LeapPad system.
This is the grossest blob of sugary water ever to touch my lips! How could you make ice cream taste so rotten? Bat barf I say!! Even if it was good, it is much too great of a hassle! It took my Dad over 2 hours to put together, and what did we get?! A tablespoon of milky water with sprinkles on top! I got this hunk of junk 2 years ago, Christmas. It has gathered dust on my shelf ever since!     
What a waste of time to air this up.  It developed leaks in less time to it took to enter the credit card info to order it.  This was the worst gift because it had such a high expectation but turned into the biggest disappointment.  The vinyl was so thin that rolling it over normal bermuda grass created holes from small seed pods and sticks.  Save your money..
This is not really a practical toy. My son gets discouraged, because you have to press on the keys really hard and in order to follow the music you have to be rough. It's like playing musical chairs with 5 bullies and a moving floor
I should have paid more attention to the reviews. He is top heavy. There's also no way to store the extra parts like Mr. Potato Head. But I love Spongebob anyway and he's now a part of my collection.

Please be careful and make sure you can see your baby when playing with these keys.  The plastic ring holding the keys can break.  We found the small broken piece in our baby's mouth!  We received this toy only three weeks ago
I was so excited to get the time tracker and am now so frustrated with it. The first one that I got did not work at all...they sent a second one and this one worked for less than 5 minutes (we tried 3 different sets of new batteries). It is such a great concept, but unfortunately is very poorly made. I was also surprised at how cheap looking the whole thing is in real life.
This machine does not work.  I will be returning it to find a better "first" machine for my daughter.  The stitiches do not hold, every instruction was followed to the letter.  It is not worth even 4 cents, much less 14 dollars.  I would have paid more for something that acutally works.  I'll keep lookin
OH MY GOSH-THIS IS TERRIBLE! My husband and I bought this game because I loved watching this as a child. This game uses the same prizes and games over and over. If you played once you have played too many times. The games are boring, the prizes are boring and it is a waste of money and time. I don't know why the box says "13 and up" because my 10 year old daughter could play this. This one is going back to the store-I got zonked out of my $24.99...if you want my opinion take the cash and run
The bar is nice, and I suppose the mat will come in handy for reviewing the basic positions. But the DVD... it's just awful. The music is painfully bad. Seriously, what dp little girls dressed like fruit have to do with ballet? And the "host" is a confusing choice: her accent is distracting, and it's made even worse by the fact that she's talking around braces. The two little girls who help her don't look much happier. In fact, the one on the left looks like someone told her to smile or else. Trying to keep up with the nominally enducational DVD is harder than you might think, as the mat has two sides and you have to flip it over mid-stream, only you get no warning and no time to do it. And the positions are introduced too quickly and with no discussion; they're just lyrics to the annoying song.Our daughter got this for her 3rd birthday, and she actually looked at me the first time we watched it and said, "I want the fruit to go away." I had to laugh out loud and tell her I did too! Overall, I'm sorry her grandparents spent $15 on this. Total disappointment
She is DISGUSTING!!! The only good thing about her is that to scare people away simply show them this doll and they'll go screaming! My friend, Lucy Banette, has this doll. The hair tangles, the clothes rip, and even she admits it SUCKS!!! Her white skin makes her look like a vampire ghost. Not one for decoration!!! Not even for a 'playing-with' doll. Too fragile and disgustingly sickening to look at! What are we trying to teach children here??? That it is good to dress like you have just died? Have you ever seen a goth look like this? NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So please, MGA, carry on with lil' Bratz. THEY RULE!!! But NOT your silly gothy, punky Bratz. I have two lil' bratz. They are in the collection 'life style'. I have Sasha and Cloe. I don't know why you called Cloe Ailani and Sasha Zada. They are STUPID names! I HAD to redo their names! It feels nice to express myself! Bye, to goth haters! GO AWAY, you silly fans of this Bratty goth doll
My daughter is almost three, and she was so excited when she received this for Christmas.  Unfortunately, the strings do not work, and also the star buttons are supposed to play notes and/or chords, and they don't work, either.  I was going to send for a replacement because my daugher absolutely loves this, and I was so disappointed when Amazon responded there are no replacements available.  I'm going to see if the manufacturer can replace it
My son received this as a birthday gift and it broke the 2nd time that he played with it. While I was putting it on him the plastic belt just snapped in half. Luckily we had a different belt from another toy that we could use with the gadgets. The previous reviewer was right about the difficulty of taking the gadgets on and off. There's no way that my 4 year old son could do it without my help. If I had the receipt I would have returned it
When we bought this, I liked the versatility it offered.  I quickly noticed, however, that it is mostly good for strewing the soft pieces everywhere.  There are actually too many pieces to keep up with, and frankly I'm getting sick of stepping on the cow.My 6 mos old likes it for a couple minutes, until he's rolled away from it.My 3 year old thinks it's interesting, but she just ends up taking it apart and the pieces end up all over the place.After a couple days of playing with it I usually put most of it away and keep out only a couple parts to complement our other toys.The water play mat lasted until my 3 year old stepped on it once or twice.  Then that was gone
My daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday.  She loves tub toys, but when you pull the tail on this one it just sits in the water.  My daughter actually plays with it more out of the tub and my husband figured  out that it actually works better if you pull the tail and let it  &quot;swim&quot; on the floor.  I'm a big fan of Sassy toys, but I'd pass  on this one
The nose is glued and sewn on, but my baby still managed to chew it off.  I found it hanging by a thread from it's face one day.  So, cut off the nose before giving it to your baby, or never leave your baby alone with it once teething starts.Too bad about the nose because my baby loves his puppytunes.
We were so excited to order this item. Sadly the quality is very poor. We have had it set up for less than a week and the front "counter" has broken off and one of the front panels has had a leg rip off. My kids love the idea of this item but it is extremely flimsy particle type board -it has basically disintergrated berfore our eyes . Even with general play it sways back and forth, a little scary if little ones are playing in it.I am going to call the maker - hopefully we can repair this (...
My 3 yr old son received this toy last year for Christmas and was so excited. In less than a week, one of the rear wheels cracked in half, rendering it a non-returnable piece of junk
This one doesn't work. It is supposed to come on when it hits the water and it doesn't. One it came on randomly but we couldn't seem to replicate it. None of this type of fish seem to do all that well but this one is worse than the others. He is pretty though
My son received this as a gift.  I love that the inside is set up like "shelves".  My son loves to organize his trains in it.  I don't like how thin the metal is.  It dents as easy as a cola can.  If it were made better, it would be worth the money.  Save your money on this one and find something better made
This Item is nothing like Picture poorly made I could have made a better one myself out of old pillow cases.Not worth the money avoid this item
Well, this game is fun but I can't believe some people thought that it would actually take you into space!Well, Its kinda stupid you just take apart a house puzzle according to some stupid card. But still, the game is really fun.--- Delane
The first time I "flew" the chicken it flopped 2 feet in front of me.  The second time it went about 6 feet.  The third time it decapitated!  I was left with a piece of stuffed chicken in each hand.  Unless you are accomplished at disassembling and reassembling stuffed animals, it is not repairable.  Save your money for something else
Ever wonder what drives someone's daughter to go into porn? This has got to be some of the most irresponsible marketing ever. Please do yourself a favor and make sure toy companys get the message to stop peddling this type of garbage
I bought this with high hopes of getting a well modeled vehicle. It took about only ten minutes to put together, and it comes with General Greivous!!! But, the legs are really weird. I wasted $20.00 dollars at a local super target I could have got a star wars video game or a few figs..... I just like adding it to my collection. But, if you have the Obi-Wan with Boga, put them together like I did. The Star Wars saga has introduced some really good toys, I am just saying that this toy is fairly good. Not a favorite. I suggest it to a collecter only........I love the line of E3 collectables. They really rock. I suggest this because it is okay in the stage of durable and fun. Star Wars E3 General Greivous' wheel bike is a great toy I hope people should think about buying
We bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  Like the previous reviewer we also didn't realize we needed to dilute the paint first.  Even with the paint diluted properly it doesn't really work as expected.  You have to wait for the paint to drip down to the bottom of the tube and then turn the spinner on.  Even then only a bit of paint comes out and you have to turn it off and wait for more to drip down.  I plan on returning this toy for a refund as well. 
This product is a box o' junk.  My son got this for Christmas this year and it is not even worth whatever the person paid for it.  The hat fell apart within three days (and he hardly played with it - just wore it on his head a few times) - the metal rim around the hat came undone and now there is a sharp metal point sticking out through the cloth on the hat, which is obviously dangerous.  I contacted the company and they have not responded. 
Wish I could give this a negative.  When I did finally get a sticker out, it wouldn't stay stuck to anything for more than five minutes.  Ended up sending it back to the wholesaler as unworkable and overpriced
As others have stated the DVD mini-games are nearly impossible to play due to wonky controls. I also have no idea what the cards or pieces are for, other then they may come into play if you "win" the main game.They should have just done a choose your own adventure type game.  It would have been less high-tech, but you could at least have a laugh when you choose "set up a perimeter" and the terrorists once again escape.DO NOT BUY
OK as far as novelty goes these ducks are SOOOO funny and what a great take on the rubber ducky!!! I bought them for my 1 year old just because I am sooooo tired of the original version of the yellow ducky. Anyone who feels this lil duck TOY is devil worship to has some serious issues, and I would suggest they need to seek some professional help.So for the faint of heart dont buy the duck because I think it has magical powers which will make you giggle in delight.
Cheaply put together and does not include the things listed on the editorial review.  I am extremely disappointed.  The sides fall out when you close it making the crayons dislodge and roll around.  It is obvious that hinges on the box will wear out quickly.  I just cant believe it is such poor quality coming from Crayola
My son received this figure for his birthday - it broke within the first 5 minutes.  The sign on his chest lights up, which is cool - but now he has no legs, so he certainly can't run
I bought this as a gift for my 81 year old mother, who is impossible to please.  She needed a new card shuffler, as she wasn't pleased with her plastic, battery operated one.  I must admit, I thoroughly expected to have to return it, since I knew she wouldn't be pleased with it.  As it turns out, I did have to return it, but here's the surprise.  I was very disappointed in its performance too!  We could not get it to shuffle cards, whether they be from a new deck, or an old, worn out, dog eared deck.  Moral of this story -- please don't buy this item, whether you're difficult to please or not
This is not a very fun toy.  My [...] got tired of filling the paint chamber because it would empty so quickly.  He also ended up dipping the brush into the paint jars.  He went through both jars of paint in under 10 minutes and was finished with the toy.  There wasn't enough paint to even create a picture.  The Happy Birthday pic on the back of the package must've taken over 20 bottles and a very skilled artist.  I think Crayola should stick to making crayons
This one is rather small and doesn't really look or feel like the rest.  Not as durable feeling as the others
This toy is not what I had expected. It isn't very durable at all and it's HARD to put together! I don't highly recommend it
What a disappointment! The music quality is very poor--most of the "intruments" sound just like every other cheap kids electronic toy.  The piano is probably the worst; the animal voices all sound the same. I thought I'd get better quality at the price, plus, the left speaker doesn't work.  My kids had a toy casio keyboard that cost $12.00 and was the size of an egg-carton, and its sound was vastly superior. I will likely have to go through the hassle of returning this.
Don't buy this unless you plan on attaching the remote to your forehead with duct-tape; if you lose the remote you cannot operate the moon. The moon also has an automatic time that it comes on; it's supposed to be when it gets dark, but it comes on way too early to be any good, because nobody is in their room that early, and it only stays on for 30 minutes. When it comes on by itself, (because its too early) you can barely notice it is on.
I bought this toy for my 4 year old grandaugher.  Since Barbie rides this horse of course a little girl will want her doll to ride the horse.  The wings fall off.  We must put the wings back on at least a dozen time a day
This is a great idea for a great marketing group . . . little kids who want to listen to music "just like the big kids." The FP3 has a few issues of it own, but the speakers were disappointing. The sound quality is not good. Even with the volume turned up it is difficult to hear. Another huge down fall is that a power cord is not available . . . so you can end up going through batteries pretty fast. To top it all off, my son has difficulty getting the FP3 correctly mounted into the speaker unit on his own. Overall we were very disappointed with this accessory
The toy is a good idea, but it needs to be more user friendly, instructions are hard to follow, even for adults,maybe not quite so much activities at one time, could simplify some for younger players
The Webkinz Yorkie Puppy I received is total different from what shown on the picture. Evne though it is still a dog it is not the one displaied on the picture which my kid really like. it is a total waste
Bought this product for my two sons ages 4 and 6.  Within the first week one of the sticks was broken.  Called the company and they sent out another one, but before it could arrive the other stick broke.  They aren't made strong enough to use.  They plastic simply cracks and totally falls apart.  We ended up throwing it out
The stars may be really nice, but the package I received looked already open. The 3 sheets with stickers appeared as if someone soaked them in water and the package was missing the putty to stick up the bigger plastic stars.
I ordered the doll because it said it will swim when put in water.  When I recieved the doll it was just a barbie.  It is not the swimming mermaid.
This thing is a waste of time effort and money.  It falls apart the minute the child tries to swing the baby, not to mention it is too small for a two tear old to play with
Bad enough that the toy is a scam that requires extra  parts.  But the surprise here is the complicity of Amazon in this misleading packaging.  This is probably why the product is unavailable suddenly and the battery charger nowhere to be found.  They know they made a mistake. If only they  would contact us each now for a full refund.    I wish a rep from Amazon could have spent the holiday week with my family as we searched from store to store for that charger.  I wish he could have spent an afternoon of watching my child stare at the toy he waited for. ..his "big" gift
The pictures get jammed in the camera and are very hard to remove.  One picture got stuck in there and so this toy was broken after about 2 days of play
I was dissapointed in the quality of this microphone. The sound effects are very loud and "crumbly" and the microphone itself is a bit cheap.  The microphone does not amplify the voice very loud either.  Cute to look at though
this is another story that I don't know if I like it or not because Amazon.com never sent it too me.  this has happened about 4/5 times.  While usually I have no problem getting movies, sometimes I do.  sending them e-mails doesn't seem to work.  If they didn't have the best prices for movies, I'd leave
This movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes.  Yes, it is slightly interesting to see the Cannes environment, but not enough to watch this film. It could be a cure for insomnia, though.  Fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed.  You can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen, and it's really just very boring. All those fans of Johnny Depp: be particularly warned. He may have co-star billing, but blink and you'll miss him
I'm sorry, but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film "Dick." "Dick" is funny, this is not. I'm sorry, but Dustin Hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like Kirsten Dunst (or that level of indefatigable cuteness).Just go rent "Dick" instead. You'll thank me, yourself, and those fine ladies who saved our country
While many of the details have been lost to time as well as the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol to numb the pain caused by the first 40 minutes or so of this celluloid nightmare, there is just enough in my memory to offer a carefully crafted, yet sharply vitriolic rebuke of this horror. In my more than four decades on this planet, there is only one film that caused such a level of disbelief, disgust and abhorrence that I actually walked out of a theater halfway through its showing. It was a film so onerous, pointless and unfunny, that it stands in the pantheon of some of the most colossal wastes of time, money and talent in the history of Western Civilization. That film is "Cabin Boy." To some, "Cabin Boy" may well serve as the cornerstone of an evening's entertainment, assuming the evening also features sock puppets and pirate hats made out of newspaper. Imagine watching someone pick at a zit for several hours then eat a sandwich. That's the kind of inventive, knee-slapping, laugh-out-loud fun you'll find in "Cabin Boy."  Having some respect for Chris Elliott's work on the old Letterman Show on NBC, I was profoundly disappointed by this unspeakably inept attempt at humor. If it doesn't induce deep REM sleep, "Cabin Boy" will surely leave you either angry or depressed. One would venture to guess these were not the results Elliott intended. Letterman's genius-level cameo notwithstanding, "Cabin Boy" is about as funny as a prostate exam...without the "local" and the lube.  
Man, I don't know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking, but it should be illegal!  This is, first off, a terrible DVD: 4:3 (full screen) format, with a dark, muddy picture.  Worse, the plot is typical, predictable, and poorly written.  Other than looking for glimpses of Teri Hatcher's body, sitting through this fiasco is a total bore.  I was also surprised at how bad Teri's acting was in this movie, since I've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this.  That is probably the fault of the director, Erik Anjou, a third-rate director (at best!) who has done a total of two movies and one documentary.  Gee, I wonder why he isn't in more demand (NOT!)!I can enjoy "B" movies, and bad movies, but this one is just so totally non-involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at.  I can't imagine that this mess was released on DVD for any reason other than to cash in on Teri Hatcher's current popularity, and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger (29 year-old) Teri Hatcher nude.  Rent this, if you must, but, wow, there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad
I have been looking for a copy of this movie for a long time now because I wanted my kids to see it. I was very young when I first watched this film and it stuck to my mind somehow. Good thing amazon had it and they do make shipments to my country here in Asia.Daryl Hannah played a beautiful and believable mermaid. Tom was also perfect for the role. I can't say their chemistry on screen is as perfect as that of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, though, but it wasn't bad. I can't imagine any other actor for the lead role in this movie.I let my kids watch it finally together with my niece. We found ourselves teary-eyed in the end. It was just so touching, we couldn't help it. Even the theme song sang by Rita Coolidge was perfect for the ending. For those who wanna know, the title is "Love came for me". I'm glad I purchased the anniversary edition. I have a home theater and the dolby 5.1 surround sound was just what I needed. It would have been better if DTS was used but I'm not complaining.For those who are thinking of getting this, I hope you make the decision to do so. Tom Hanks is a certified great actor. This movie will soon be in line with the classics like "Gone with the wind" and "Breakfast at Tiffany's". It's already a collector's item. You won't regret it! Besides, love stories don't get out of style
There's a reason why they talk about the "Voice of an Angel" -- it's because Charlotte Church certainly doesn't have the acting presence of one. Her acting debut "I'll Be There" is proof enough -- only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres, where it rapidly dropped out of sight. Rightly so.Seventeen years ago, Paul Kerr (Craig Ferguson) of the Love Rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert. Fast forward to the present: Kerr discovers that unknown to him, his ex Rebecca (Jemma Redgrave) gave birth to a daughter, Olivia (Charlotte Church), who is now a well-adjusted paper girl.The problem is, Olivia has been kept a secret from her dad. Rebecca is embittered, but Kerr wants to get to know his daughter, and similarly Olivia wants to get to know her father. Music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel-voiced girl and the burned-out rocker together, but Rebecca doesn't want her child to follow in her father's footsteps."I'll Be There" was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress Liv Tyler, who, despite being only in her twenties, has had an immensely interesting life. Well, maybe someday she WILL get a biopic, because "I'll Be There" is only similar in one way: It involves a rock star and his daughter. Otherwise, it is boring in about every way that Tyler's life is interesting.With a forgettable script, not much humor and a goofy premise, the movie doesn't have a lot going for it -- it reads like a disgruntled teenager's absurdist fantasy, scripted for Church to act out. And not a terribly interesting teenager, either. It gets increasingly ridiculous when Olivia decides to pursue music to bond with Daddy Dearest; it's an obvious ploy to show off Church's vocal skills. The best that can be said of Church's performance is that at times she looks sweet. As for acting talent, she is bland at best, but she does perform some good songs, and her voice is as pretty as ever. Just watch the songs and fast-forward her actual scenes. Redgrave does as good a job as she can, and Ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker. His is the only memorable role in the film, and it's a shame that the movie didn't focus on him rather than the dull Miss Church.Miss Church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film -- also known as the Britney Spears approach. "I'll Be There," but I promise I'll get out as soon as I can
Having been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience.  However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens.  The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior.  Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them.  As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation.  The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise?  The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes.  Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right.  Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth
Please think this DVD is recorded in 1986. More worse, this is recorded as a documentary. Sound quality is worst. After I bought this and DVD of &quot;Company&quot; (same, worst sound quality DOCUMENTARY), I suspect the word &quot;concert&quot; or &quot;soundtrack&quot; in DVD title
Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible
Waste of money.  Waste of time.  Well-known cast.  Amateurish direction.  Plotless.  Politically correct to the point of being stupid.  The film's incessant attempts at humor fail.  Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film.  He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false.  It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character.  The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant.  The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss.  Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off.  Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments.  If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did
Whenever I'm asked what is the worst movie I have ever seen, I quickly respond, "Cabin Boy." It is like a long, meandering, and entirely pointless joke one might hear from an obnoxious coworker. I would describe the plot, but there is none. I watched the entire movie waiting for the punchline, but it never came. It was written by a former staff writer for David Letterman, which is the only conceivable reason that Letterman would agree to appear in such a monstrosity. Even he later joked about how awful the movie was. Chris Elliott plays the only character he has ever played--the annoyimg dumb guy loser. His limited acting talent, combined with a nonsensical plot, unfunny dialogue, and an absurd tendency to confuse silliness with humor, truly make Cabin Boy a cinematic experience everyone should miss
I agree with David Thomson when he says few audiences in the West would be content to view an American epic composed solely of battles and their contexts. Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with "Kagemusha" and "Ran", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about "historical" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan. He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt). I am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no "ugly" shot in either "Ran" or "Kag" - merely that there are more "authentically Japanese" films out there to choose from.  
The opening strip scene is reminiscent of Barbarella - too bad those aren't Basinger's legs though. Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it. Flat and mechanical
I was very gung ho when I found out that Disney was finally releasing the Davy Crockett TV show on DVD.  I grew up watching the two Davy Crockett movies.  HOwever upon actually seeing these DVDs I was very disappointed.  It is exactly the same as those two movies it is just split into five seperate episodes.  The Episodes: Davy Crockett, Indian Fighter; Davy Crockett Goes to Congress; and Davy Crockett at the Alamo are all the parts included in the movie Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier.  The episodes Davy Crockett's Keelboat Race; Davy Crockett and the River Pirates; were what made up the movie Davy Crockett and the River Pirates.  I for one am planning on buying the newer version that came out in 2004 that is just the two movies on one disc.  The only difference between this set and the new set is that there are couple of features on this set and that there are introductions to the episodes buy Leonard Maltin and it has two discs in a tin collector's box.  The biggest difference of all is that this set runs from between $37-$100 whereas you can buy the two movies on DVD for $14-$16.  I myself will go for the cheaper movie set rather than have to watch each episode sperately.  
The details are all fine if you don't know the middle east - but are not well researched and inconsistent.  I won't bore you with the list.  All the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake.  Tell us something new.  The overall storyline does not have much else going for it - I was expecting more intrigue, a more synthesized story line.  A disappointment. 
I picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it, and absolutely loved it! It is so smart, funny, and heartbreaking, without ever being sappy. So, naturally, I was curious about the movie too. I figured that because Ephron had written the screenplay too, not much could go wrong. And while the story line followed the book more or less, the movie turned out terrible. I could not have been more disappointed!! First of all, Jack Nicholson is completely miscast, because he essentially plays himself (as usual), not the *interesting* guy that Mark is supposed to be. He is the opposite of charming, funny, tender, lovable, i.e. somebody that the character of the wife (Rachel) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely. You suspect all along that he is a cad; therefore, Rachel's utter shock at his betrayal doesn't make sense. Besides, he is too old for the role! Meryl Streep is annoyingly twitchy, but much better in her role as Rachel. Still, she can't carry the movie alone, and her love scenes with Nicholson are flat; there is no spark there. I wonder how happy Ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel, and whether she really did write all the scenes. The wedding scene, where Rachel has doubts about marying Mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing, while the wedding guests wait, is out of place, not to mention boring, not to mention heavy handed. A total dud
If you've seen one you've seen them all. Uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl, she brings him out of his shell.Well, I bought this for like two dollars, and maybe it was worth it. I watch it like once a year. No special features on DVD worth mentioning.Ben Affleck is getting married, he has to fly down to the south from NY for the wedding. But things keep getting in his way. Forces of Nature. Also, he keeps running into, and can't seem to get away from, some weird chick (Bullock). Are these signs? Should he stop being so uptight, and go with this free-spirited chick? Or should he be an adult and get married and accept his Vanilla lifestyle?The acting in this movie is "meh", meaning Sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie; and Affleck sucks, as usual. The other small parts are well done, for the most part.The script is formulaic, and the cinematography at times is interesting. It's just another rom-com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell. The movie opens with a stripper scene, no nudity. There is also a pot-smoking scene in this movie. There is also a scene where Affleck strips at a gay bar. Just thought I'd throw that in, in case you're considering buying this for your teen daughter or something, and that kind of thing bothers you.You only need to buy this is you are a rom-com fanatic, or a big fan of either Affleck or Bullock. Otherwise this is completely forgettable.
Quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book. Hopefully they will remake the movie soon, because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice
I saw this movie about two weeks ago and I can't believe how disappointed I am for this. I was expecting fireworks; instead I got a truckload of bad karma on my head. Not only that but it maybe the most over-the-top film I ever saw and it will be on my list of the worst movies I ever saw. To begin with half of the characters die in this film and I was like 'What is the meaning?' then there's the film's signature moment in which Sinatra wakes up from his nightmare and they do it in such a matter that they put his face right at the camera. Again I said to myself, 'What's the point?' And then there's the chilling climax which would be totally ripped off a year later by the Kennedy assassination-from the scoped rifle right down to James Gregory's character getting shot in the head. In one of the documentries to this DVD director William Fredkin says that there is no doubt this movie caused Lee Harvey Oswald to kill President Kennedy because 'Oswald realized that he was Raymond Shaw.' If he's right that raises the question: Did he do it by his beliefs or did someone push him over? Then Fredkin ends his obseravation by saying that the release of "The Manchurian Candidate" and the death of President Kennedy are the two events that made the 1960's what it is and why people today (including me) are still obessed with that decade. In conclusion, I think this was a big disappoinment. And this movie is on the list of AFI's 100 greatest films? Please.
I thought from the description that this could be an interesting film and gave it a shot. It was terrible. First because of the camera shake, I don't know about you but I can't sit trough a film with continuous camera shaking. Needless to say I didn't make it through the whole film, but from what I saw the main actor was irritating to watch
If a "suspense" filmed was played in the woods, and it didn't actually contain any suspense, would a bear watch it? The previous sentence makes about as much suspense as the reason behind making "Domestic Disturbance", the newest `thriller' starring John Travolta, Vince Vaughn and Teri Polo. Let's talk for a few minutes about Mr. Travolta. Can anyone name an actor who has received more chances in his career and squandered them? I think that Travolta has now surpassed Richard Dreyfuss as the comeback/ lose it again king. After a brilliant comeback engineered by his longtime admirer Quentin Tarantino in "Pulp Fiction", Travolta appeared in a number of films that were interesting and proved interesting choices. "Face/Off" and "Broken Arrow" highlighted a string of hits that ultimately allowed Travolta to join the $20 million club. In the last few years, every film Travolta has appeared in has failed miserably. "Lucky Numbers"? "The General's Daughter"? That film was a hit but can anyone even remember one significant scene from it? "Swordfish"? Interesting, but a flop. "Battlefield Earth"? Why does he keep making this trash? It has to be the paychecks. I can't see any other conceivable reason. John, baby, how long before the studios realize that these films aren't making any money and they stop hiring you? John, baby, how long before you need another comeback vehicle? Frank Morrison (John Travolta) is a divorced father who makes wooden boats. He doesn't get a lot of business, but the business that he does get gets a great deal. He doesn't charge his customers enough to make a profit. Frank does this because HE IS THE GOOD GUY. His son, Danny (Matthew O'Leary) has a lot of problems accepting his mom's (Teri Polo) new relationship with Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn). He gets into a lot of trouble and lies to everyone. A couple of days after his mom and Rick get married, he stows away in Rick's car and witnesses him murdering a business associate. The police don't believe him however. After a little soul searching, Frank believes his son. He may lie to everyone, but he doesn't lie to Frank. Directed by Harold Becker ("Sea of Love"), "Domestic Disturbance" is a suspense film without any suspense. From the moment Danny stows away in Rick's car and WATCHES HIM MURDER Ray (Steve Buscemi), which we also watch, we know who the good guy is and who the bad guy is. To make matters worse, Frank instantly believes his son, which means that the film boils down to a cat and mouse game between Frank and Rick. A boring cat and mouse game. When you know the identity of the villain, a huge percentage of the suspense is flushed down the toilet. When Frank believes Danny early on, the rest of the suspense is flushed down with it. The film would've been greatly improved by showing Danny in the backseat of the car, watching everything, the pain and suspense registering on his face, while the audience sees nothing. Then, when Danny tries to convince his dad, the police chief, his mom, that Rick is a murderer, at least we haven't seen the act, and we would require some convincing as well. Because the filmmakers chose to show us everything, the next logical step to provide some suspense would be to have Frank doubt Danny, his son. However, after a very brief segment, Frank believes Danny, causing us to watch a battle between Frank and Rick, which isn't very interesting. Each of the actors, including Travolta, are serviceable in their roles, but because the film robs us of just about everything in the first fifteen minutes, the remaining ninety become an exercise in tedium. Skip "Domestic Disturbance". It isn't even worthy of a video rental. Go to see the far superior and very different "Amelie" or "The Man Who Wasn't There". Your money will be much better spent.
All the promos made me think that this would be a really great Sci-Fi story with beautiful babes all over the place.  Well, there WERE some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies, never materialized.  Has the art of "posing" been lost by modern girls?  Maybe all the good directors have retired or died!  What a pity...Why, I couldn't even muster a stiff upper lip as I played this DVD through to the end.  In spite of my being a certifiable "dirty old man". [:-)    
Totally disappointed!!!I love Woody Allen, love his filmsBUT - dvd-s are coded for US market and are not possible to be viewed on our European dvd -s total waste of moneyyou should have warned me on thatBarbara Kalas, architect from Croatia
Pleasant movie but nothing special, a very ordinary story. Audrey Hepburn's charisma is what puts some life to the movie. Some subtle humour though
This was a critically lauded film, so when I went in, I had high expectations.  Roger Ebert himself called it a masterpiece.  I saw it, and it was certainly interesting, but I immediately forgot about it right after I left the theater.  There really isn't much depth here.  It's more reminiscent of getting a quick rush from something, then after it wears off, you don't even remember how you felt afterwards.  I remember a scene where a cow is blown up, but other than that, it's hard for me to remember anything about it.  It ultimately was very ordinary, and not a really deep film about war. 
I watched Anger Management on the plane. Since there is nothing else to watch, and the flight is more than ten hours, you usually watch whatever is on T.V. I thought that this movie as a whole was pretty bad, though there are some funny parts. There is some offensive language. Overall, it's a bad movie and is not worth watching. 
I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok
I think there was packaging or a sticker that compared this film to Pulp Fiction.  As if.  Beyond minor superficial similarities - I dont see it.Le Samurai is one of the most boring films Ive watched recently without turning it off.  In retrospect I wish I had turned it off or never wasted my time since the ending is so dull.  Imagine if breathless had a slightly more complicated plot, but the main character had no charisma.  Or if Alphaville (the film not the treatment) was more 100 times more boring.  Le Samurai makes Tokyo Drifter seem like a thrill ride.  I was not impressed by this film on any level.If you are into being bored.  Or if your so freaking smart you can watch paint drying and fill it with significance, this is the film for you
The ones that are posted twice do not work. If they are posted once, you can try to download it, but it might not work. The video only worked for about a minute. Shame, since I really like this show and I wanted Amazon Unbox to be cool. The one cent CSI works, go download tha
I wasn't expecting Disney, but I was less than thrilled by this feature.  I'm assuming there's a genera of animation produced in the mid 70's that took the whole 'stoner' heavy metal thing and ran with it.  Many many long drawn out scenes with rock music and psychedelic colors that did nothing for the story.  I am an animation junkie and will watch anything and everything, but I couldn't get through this whole film
This video has some very effective routines, but the moves are performed much too fast for safe form.  Because they are done so fast, injuries can incur.  She starts out slowly but quickly go into, what she calls, super sets.  I have several videos, and that is definitely not the proper way to super set.  Normally, you could modify the moves by performing them slower, but, because they are time crunch workouts (about 10 minutes each segment), you really don't have the time to do that.  Definitely, not one of her better videos.  The routines are easy, but because of the improper form used, not recommended for the beginner, as it could do my damage then good.  If you are a Denise Austin fan (even though her voice is a bit annoying and this is not one of her better videos, she's still a great instructor), try one of her Hit The Spot segments. 
Lorna is pretty, and her suitor is devoted. The story holds your attention. For many that is enough. Some auspicious beginnings, without depth. So maybe 3-stars for some people. I give 2-stars, if I do not keep it to watch again in later years. I found the romance unfulfilling, and so the movie. Romance movies that I liked better are: "North & South", "Pride & Prejudice"-1940, & 1996 & 2006, "Wives and Daughters", and "A Walk to Remember". Adventure with romance: "The Scarlet Pimpernel".
This isn't funny. It isn't well directed or scripted. Perhaps it could have been great, if it had had a decent scriptwriter or director, but it didn't, so it turned out mediocre at best. Unfortunately, I believed all the hype on this website and bought a copy of this for my boyfriend and I to watch. I told my boyfriend that according to most of the reviews I'd read, this was going to be a brilliant, hilarious cult classic. But now that we've watched it, he and I both know better. We know it's dreadful, and I can only imagine all the nice things I'm going to have to do for him to make up for my expecting him to sit through this tedious monstrosity. The only highlight for us was a spirited argument he and I got into halfway through the movie about where we'd seen one of the actors in the movie before. I'm pleased to say I won the argument. That was pretty much the only highlight of the movie for me.In my opinion this is not a 'hilarious cult classic' as others so often describe it. I don't know how drunk I'd have to be to agree with that assessment of the movie, or to find it even a little bit funny, but I suspect I would have to get smashed enough that I'd need a stomach pump afterwards.If you want to see a genuinly hilarious cult sci-fi classic, pick up a copy of Flash Gordon. That has great actors, great sets, wonderfully campy scripts, brilliant humour, and a soundtrack by Queen. Furthermore, it has stood the test of time and is still great today, unlike 'The Ice Pirates', which has dated REALLY badly. Better yet, get hold of some 'Red Dwarf' dvds...seriously, Red Dwarf is sci fi humour at its BEST! It's so good, it will spoil you for other sci fi comedies

This is one creative way in which to recoup some of the loss incurred by buying this nightmare. If you are one of the unfortunate who rent this waste of time(like I was) recommend that your local video store make one empty space on their shelves and toss this loser. This 71 minute "experience", which feels more like 100 Days of Viewing Hell, is nothing more then a montage of artsy, disjoined, surreal scenes. It quickly becomes boring after the first 5 minutes, tedious after 10 minutes, and downright irritating at around 15 minutes. I actually made the mistake of suffering through to the end, hoping that something magical would happen to make everything half-way understandable. This film could only appeal to the rare, artistically elite, filmgoer who finds anything as superficial as character development or cumbersome as plot layout simply uninspiring
THE SOUND IS BAD. I HAVE TRIED THIS DVD ON 2 DIFFERENT PLAYERS AND IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
Everthing about this movie was bad.  The Acting, the story, the revenge of the nerds like characters and humor.  The acting and production value was so bad that you'd think it was a home made movie with somebody using a home camera from 1975.  How much did it cost them to film this movie?  50 bucks?  The Revenge of the Nerds like script has been done to death and has never been funny to begin with
Yes, I must admit that I was fooled by the "One of the most notorious, most debated, most banned films of the 'video nasty' era." line on this back of this movie case.  I was lucky because I found this at a Best Buy for $10.99.  It should be $2.99 for as bad as it is.  I've been let down by these Italian Horror Films one too many times.  If you want good, gore filled, Italian Horror stick with Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento.  Once you get past the bad dubbing and acting they're berrible.  Oh, by the way, unless you are fluent in Italian this second disk is almost worthless-there is no opportunity to even have English subtitles.  The only thing good about the second disk is the nudity and strong sexual content and that looks alright in any language
Throughly dismisses all Jazz after 1960, including Fusion, Free Jazz, and everything thereafter. Marsalis actually calls Cecil Taylor's music "self-indulgent bullsh**" Apparently Taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film. How was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual (but more likely agenda-driven) on PBS, I will never understand. If you think Swing is the only valid form of Jazz, you will love this series. If you think Coltrane is a God, you get five minutes' summary. So lets see here: 15 hours on Louis Armstrong and Duke, 5 minutes on Coletrane, and a total didmissal of everything after Duke's death. Reminds me of the Republisuck's "Fair and Balanced" nonsense. PBS, this is your wake-up call. Stop trying to rewrite history - Jazz ain't in a museum. Just ask the artists (most of whom are alive) whom Burns left out. Metheny, you out there
...But it gets one star for the brief moments that Ricky Jay has in the film and another for portions of Alec Baldwin's performance.  Overall this is a stinker.  Mamet is not a good director.  He should stick to writing
As usual, Robert Duvall's acting was phenomenal - why I purchased the movie - BUT the movie itself was pointless and boring.  My husband and I fell asleep.....when we woke up Robert Duvall's character was dead!  Enough said
It's always nice to watch Famke Janssen, of course, but I like it better when she's either a very smart X-Person or a Bond-busting sadist.  This movie really wanted to scare me but sheesh.  And the bad guy was like an evil version of Sgt. Carter from Gomer Pyle - totally implausible.  I think the problems start in these movies when horror writers direct them
      This movie,   the story of a shocking long-ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it,  is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime.   The modern day portion of the movie is very tedious.    Elizabeth Hurley's and Sean Penn's characters are laughable caricatures.    Anita Shreve's writings never disappoint,   read the book instead. 
Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for
I was really disappointed with this entry even though Jason Takes Manhattan isn't much better! The DVD treatment is way to good for this film. If you want to complete the Friday series it should be seen as it does set up for the Freddy VS Jason movie.
A totally awesome movie when it was first released, Hawaii is based on the James A. Michener bestseller. Even at three hours plus, it still had to leave a lot of Michener's novel untouched, but the basic idea is still there. The breathtaking cinematography adds to it, as does an outstanding Elmer Bernstein score. Then there's the acting by the stars, Max Von Sydow as the missionary who goes to Hawaii to preach to the natives, and brings his own brand of religion with him. Julie Anderws is outstanding in a rare non-singing role as his wife. Richard Harris is excellent as the sea captain who is amazed that the preacher's wife turns out to be an old girlfriend.The supporting characters are just as memoriable, with an actual islander playing the queen, and also an unknown playing Keoki.All in all, take Hawaii complete, or don't take it at all. Wait until the complete version comes out on DVD. I rated it one star because of the cuts, but it is a five-star movie in its complete version
Ok, so I am not a big vampire movie fan, so maybe that had something to do with the fact that I thought this movie sucked. But I am always open minded to all sorts of films, so I thought I would give this one a whirl. It started out with some potential, but within the first 20 minutes I knew it was going to be hopeless. I should have just turned the darned thing off. It was so unrealistic (ok, I know it's a vampire movie, so what did I expect) but I just didn't believe that the main character (Kerr) would have done the things he ended up doing thru out the movie. And then the girl (Izabella Miko) who had about 8 lines in the movie; that was just lame and pointless. She must have felt like such a loser telling people, yeah, I'm in this movie "The Forsaken", and I'm in it almost the entire time...but....ahhh....well just call me zombie girl. Anyways, I highly recommend a pass on this one, unless you are a complete vampire fanatic
I just want to let potential marketplace buyers of SALO that the seller: closeoutgoods and other Amazon marketplace sellers are selling pirated (bootlegged) editions of this movie and other Criterion DVDs. If Amazon were legitimate, they would ban these marketplace sellers from their website. Every potential buyer should report these crooks to the FBI and Criterion
Good cast, adaptation of King Lear. Don't bother unless you are really bored
Why, oh why do you advertise the 1979 version of Crime & Punishment with John Hurt, using the pictures from the 2002 version starring the sublime John Simm. I would download the 2002 version all day, everyday but the misleading pictures are really unfair. Either offer me the version I want, or get the pictures right
I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet
'Clownhouse' is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor. While hearing of Salva's conviction when 'Jeepers Creepers' came out, I never knew it had anything to do with this movie, nor had I ever heard of this in the first place. I actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides 'It', and came across this weird little 'Halloween'-like suspense tale. While the sex scandal never once popped into my head (except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid), I still didn't care for this too much, despite its pluses.Like 'Halloween', this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out, but sadly, it didn't really get to me. If I was about 9 or so, this would've scared the hell out of me. I'm not saying I hated this; it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images, but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children, it lost some effect for me. I would have liked it better if I had no idea what was going on, and it would've been a creepier experience.Horror movie fans should like this, even though I personally thought it would be better. The atmosphere is very, very creepy, and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way, but it just didn't do it for me. Rent it first
I have not seen this movie, but thanks to the review of "A viewer" from July 2001, I don't have to
Sorry but i totaly disagree with all these positive reviews.I'm a fan of war classic films but this one is a mess.Nothing is moving,action is zero and filming is poor.we are very far away from dirty dozen,battle of the bulge,midway,enemy below etc....a total waste of time and money
I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!!
This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence
After two hours of watching it, I still don't know what it was about.  Yes, the scenery is fantastic, but a National Geographic film would have done more.  I applaud the acting of Milla Jovovich, and Nastassja Kinski.  But, the kudos reviewers have given to Peter Mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie.  I hardly heard anything he said and there are no English subtitles offered on the dvd.  As for Wes Bentley, that's acting?  He kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him, or a co-worker being blown to "Kingdom Come" (that's a pun based on the movie).  He makes Clint Eastwood look like Laurence Olivier.  The film is supposedly based on a Thomas Hardy book, but very loosely based, and the scriptwriters should have at least used Cliff Notes to have learned more about the story and the character development.  They obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest.  
This blatently derivative (hat tip to Ridley Scott's Alien, with a hint of Stanley Donen's Saturn 3 thrown in) movie should surely win the award for the most irritatingly gratuitous over-use of strobe lighting ever. This makes it extremely uncomfortable to watch and is, presumably, employed to detract from the lack of any genuine thrills. Throw in a ridiculously precocious ship's computer and a downright silly robot, and this adds up to one helluva big turkey in space. James Spader and Angela Bassett do their best to make something out of an inadequate script and plot, but this is unremittingly dreadful and dull.  The &quot;happy ever after&quot; finale will probably make you cringe in its corniness. Supernova's only redeeming factor is that it is very short
Years ago, a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends, and decide to keep a secret. Years later when they're all in high school, the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them. Your typical 80s horror film, not very notable other than Leslie Nielsen, and Jamie Lee Curtis. This is one prom, better left unattended
Dragonheart did not need a sequel. The story was told. It is over. The first movie peaked therfore, end of franchise. This has bad acting, terrible C.G.I., and stupid story. Stick with the first
I wont buy this title until they release the original WIDESCREEN version
This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is..
I saw the show on stage.  I saw most of the original productions that are reprised in this.  Unfortunately, this is Ann Reinking's version of Bob Fosse.  Reinking is a great performer who was considered the quintessential Fosse dancer of the 70's and 80's created this tribute.  The difference is Ann Reinking has taken the Fosse style and utilized this to create a style of her own.As a tribute to Fosse this is inaccurate.  Therefore, for Fosse aficiandos this is not an acurate recreation but an interpretation of his works.  Also, there is a too big reliance on his concept musical "Dancin'".The one good thing in this is the addition of another Fosse creation Ben Vereen.  He shows why he can still pack a house.My suggestion is to rent Fosse films like Sweet Charity and All that Jazz.  You'll get to see the real Fosse
Like most people who made the effort to see this movie, I read Tim Sandlin's book and thoroughly enjoyed it. Unfortunately for this movie, Sandlin is a far better novelist than screenwriter. The film is disjointed, awkward, and hard to follow. It quickly hops from one important moment of the book to another, allowing almost no time to understand the characters and their motivations or appreciate the bizarre circumstances of the story. The casting isn't bad-- a prepubescent Mischa Barton was a fine choice (a hysterical one for fans of the O.C.), and Jennifer Jason Leigh is also respectable, although she doesn't fit her character's physical description-- but that doesn't nearly make up for the film's jumpy direction and half-baked plot. In sum, this is a dissatisfying and substandard film. Undoubtedly, the subject matter is better suited for a novel, and Sandlin's humor and talents are better utilized there. Read his books. Avoid this movie.
I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up.

"The World According to Garp" is on my top 5 list of favorite books of all time.  It's one of those rare books that makes you laugh out loud, but still really feel the emotion of the characters, and the story really sticks with you.  (I made a joke about an Ellen Jamesian just the other day, lol ~ yes, it was a dumb joke that no one else got, but, that's how it goes sometimes :)  I was introduced to the book in college, well after the book and the movie were released, but I had never heard of either one.  I read the book in just a couple of days ~ I couldn't put it down, and I chatted it up with everyone who would listen.  I've re-read it several times since then, and i still think it's terrific.  Naturally, when i found out there was already a movie . . . I was thrilled!  I ordered it right away . . . but i wish i'd never wasted my money.  On it's own, the movie might be alirght.  But when you're invested in the book, when you know the characters, Robin Williams just isn't Garp.  I love Robin Williams, he's a great comedian, that's not a question.  I just think that the casting for this part was way off base.  and if you can't believe the main character, the rest of it's crap.   If you've never read the book, I highly recommend it!!
right off the bat, JJ runs into an indian in the middle of nowhere, the indian has is gun JJ doesnt, oh boy the tension fills the air, no wait, for the FIRST TIME EVER, the indian turns and rides away, does NOT kill the white man, who is all alone on the Indians land, trying to catch HIS fish.     liberal revisionist trying to make the indian look like he is better than the white man, and oh smarter also, for just after that, JJ is trying to get a fire going "but" does this under a tree that has snow all over it, he gets the fire going and oh darn!  snow fell on it!  dumb white man!  If this movie didnt have superstar Robert Redford in it, would of been just another dumb movie, like that idiot Timmy that made Grizzly Man.   An Indian that lets a white man live all out in the middle of nowhere, LOL!  yes the white man stole the land, yes the white man did this that and everything else to the indians.   But its not like they were angels, they fought with each other just like the rest of the world has always done throught history.   to deny that, is just plain stupid. The 1970's, marks the turning point the liberals took over Hollyweird.  Clint Eastwood never would of made this move in the 1960's, or ever.    
The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them
If you are looking for a good story and character development, this movie dissapoints. The story is rather thin and slow with more focus on Joe's good looks. A irritatating aspect of the DVD was white flashes occuring at  innapropriate moments during the movie
The dynamic Root duo deliver yet another yawner in this painful children's comedy.  My advice to Root is that he should be selling barbeques rather than this silly trash.  The only thing that redeems this movie is the acting of the child Curtis.  Big props to my man for his preformance.  Hope to see you in more movies to come.p.s. I think Taylor Root is still a virgin
The languages and images don't connect. We were given this as a gift because of the linguistic value, but instead the entire dvd doesn't offer it. The other dvds in this collection are great. This one failed to teach anything
This recording is simply DEFECTIVE.It opens with a disclamer about the quality of the recording, and boy, they are not kidding!This is not a simple case of VHS quality on a DVD.  Instead the video quality is comporable to the first live broadcast from the 1969 moon landing.  And the audio quality is in the same league as early cheap casette recorders, complete with pitch shifts..It is clear that abosoltely no attempt was made to clean up or remaster this recording.  Even the title credits suffer from from jitter distortion and there is time base noise at the bottom of each frame.Some example frames at VienneseBall dot org slash PiratesThis is particularly criminal because it was such a superb cast and inspired live performance.I am immediately returning this to Amazon.  This recording should never have been released
"Houseboat" never arrived here.  I have been patiently waiting at the dock, but no boat.  PLEASE send it at once
Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show
THIS MOVIE WAS OBVIOUSLY MADE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN, AND OLDER PEOPLE WILL NOYT UNDERSTAND IT
This movie is the most frightening film I've tried to watch with my [...] daughter. It is NOT suitable for very young children. I was rather horrified by just how creepy it is. The juxtaposition of the saccharine bears with the sadistic cruel scary "spirit" is truly bizarre and could;ve been created by someone who in fact HATES children. If you are not buying this movie due to your own nostalgic desire to relive the 80's, but to watch something sweet and cuddly with your sweet and cuddly children, be forewarned. This movie is not only bad, it's kinda 'bad'. Like, not in a good way. If children are not involved in the purchase- but you are reliving the 80's or getting some really weird gift for a friend, then, you know, maybe you'll dig it. I didn't
Sure the animation is interesting for a few minutes (if you are interested in rotoscoping see Waking Life) but the story and writing are horrible and bordem sets in within ten minutes.  You will hang in for a bit waiting for somthing to happen but it won't so don't bother with this movie, it's painful to sit through (and I love rotoscoping)
Harriets adventures include feeding laxatives to her rivals, and her bright friend's big plan is to set off a smoke bomb (incendiary) during a school assembly. Either one will get a kid expelled, arrested, and in the newspapers. Not amusing ! Then there's Golly telling her about the virtues of lying. If there is a lesson that could be drawn (which the movie misses), Harriet's secrecy from her parents manages to create a full blown crisis out of nothing, because she is showing the sort of behavior that (in a kid 2 years older) would be take as a possible symptoms for other bad things like self-mutilation or bulemia, as in the movie "Thirteen.
As ex-infantry I found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable. This low budget movie spoils the book. A supposed highlight is the SAS field craft, but that's a bad joke. The SAS troop crowds around for camera shots, all the while talking loudly if not shouting. Bog normal infantry don't do this never mind the best of the best, the SAS. The fire-fight sequences are passable. The interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but can't make up for the rest of it. The foul language Even if it's what they used in the field, should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot, making it unsuitable for many audiences
As along time fan of Paddy Chayefsky, I found "Altered States", his first novel, terribly disappointing. The film was, in my view, utterly dismal. The only reason I would recommend it, would be as an example of "hack movie making". If it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either Chayefsky or Russell, both would be relegated to obscurity
The personality of a Nazi brownshirt was one of a heightened need for acceptance.  Fred Leuchter was painted as such by many people, some who knew him(and I'm guessing knew better) and as we may be witnessing others who didn't.  Brownshirts insult, assault, rather than intellectually confront and expose objections to their popular ideas.Maybe a major lesson of the Holocaust is that the brownshirt mentality can live in any culture so long as a popular movement of idea is available for them to cling to.  So long as the need for acceptance outweighs the need for a competition of ideas.  There must be someone to hate for the brownshirt to exist, so that they may prove their allegiance to the group.  Maybe a great contribution one can give to their group is sincere dissent, as dissent does not equal disloyalty...except in a Nazi state.  There was a great free press in Germany in Nazi times, so long as that free thought was constrained within the preset boundaries.  "Mr. Death" is not representation of Fred Leuchter.  Fred Leuchter is representation of Fred Leuchter.  Might I suggest NOT suggesting a collection of articles by many of the same people in this documentary.  That's not clarification, that's reinforcement of one idea.  Rather go and find Fred and speak to him.  Get his view.  If you don't have a preformed agenda (like Van Pelt or Morris), you may get him to respond like I did.  I found a different Fred(and a much much different story) than I was given by director Morris and others.The question is not whether German gas chambers were used to murder people, the question is whether someone will be allowed to think contrary to that, or any other idea.  That is, without having his house firebombed, a concerted effort to ruin him financially take place, have his reputation ruined, or any of the other stuff happen.  If Fred's ordeal is any indication, the brownshirts are alive and well, but I don't think Fred is one of them.The one fact I would alter in my previous post is Rabbi Bauer's support for "no gas chambers".  Bauer supported Fred's methods, not necessarily his conclusion.  I tried in vain to contact Bauer, on where he differs with Fred.  Fred has high regard for Rabbi Bauer.  The Polish forensic investigation(which came soon after Fred's!) did not come to the same conclusion as Fred, but did essentially duplicate Fred's data collection methods and results.  There was testimony at the Nuremburg trials by both inmates and German staff that homocidal gassings took place in those camps in Germany.  In 1960, physical and chemical tests showed that no gassings occured there.  It took 16 years(1976) for Simon Weisenthal to admit that no gassings took place in those German concentration camps.  A former inmate at Auschwitz has said that no homocidal gassings took place there.  But all this isn't to say that the Auschwitz gassings didn't occur, but rather to simply say that some may think they didn't occur and for that they shouldn't be condemned...unless the idea is to create an enemy out of sincere people like Fred
one of the worst movies ever    this stuff must have been made up and total lack of common sense makes this movie an amatureish comed
It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey.I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly.Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters
Private investigator and former police detective Jack Ramsey (Michael Harris) is enjoying an affair with the local district attorney's wife, but when she is strangled not long after he has departed following a session of amorous activity, Ramsey is pegged as the primary suspect due to "clues" obviously planted at the murder scene in order to incriminate him, and additionally because of a zealous detective (Matt McCoy) who has personal persons for disliking the former policeman.  As Ramsey tries to clear his name, the sister (Carrie-Anne Moss) of the deceased shows up, and soon she and Jack begin their own affair that is complicated by subsequent homicides and by Jack's former police partner, performed by Brion James, ostensibly, despite private devils, the sole individual Ramsey can trust as additional evidence mounts against him despite entry of other suspects.  Harris, a charismatic player who has created excellent roles, can do but little with a script that defeats as well the rest of the cast, hindered by a wandering plot that is clichd and predictable from the film's opening while, despite helpful cutting, there remains an obligatory slow motion love scene, as well as embarrassing emoting from McCoy, Moss and James that is made unduly prominent because of faltering direction. 
This is a pleasant film to look at as far as the pretty girls and the colorful scenes.However that's about all the good things I can say about it.I can think of a lot better things that the pretty girls in this movie could have done besides getting their faces burned off, getting killed by a walking suit of armor, etc..There's a diary involved but what exactly is in this diary I still have no idea.  Maybe I lost something with the English dubbing.  Once I lost the point about the diary there was no hope of understanding the plot.  There's some cocaine use involved somewhere but where that all fits in I don't know.The ending is anticlimactic and really not possible from a logical point of view.  I don't want to ruin the 'suspense' by telling what happens.Based on reading the high praises of other reviewers I may not be sophisticated enough to appreciate this movie.Give me "Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman" or "Brides Of Blood" any day over this movie.Jeff MarzanoRecommended further viewing:Horror HotelIT !

Albert Pyun is my absolute least favorite director. I hate his guts. His direction ruined &quot;Cyborg&quot; and was murky in &quot;Omega Doom.&quot; This is his best flick, and it's not that good. In fact, it pales in comparison to the so-so original. Sasha Mitchell is highly entertaining in this sequel that is certainly watchable, but highly forgettable. The villain from the first, Tong Po, has returned after killing the Sloan brothers from the first movie. Now, he's out to redeem his honor by fighting little brother David Sloan. Standard martial arts fare. Some choppy fight scenes, but an interesting main character saves this picture from otherwise becoming complete dreck
Some people praise `We Don't Live Here Any More" as one of the realistic portrayals of two married couples, tired of lies, not really knowing what to do. It is also true that Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo have exceptional talent and here again they would not disappoint you with their fine acting. The film as a result looks like a filmed version of some John Updike novels (actually it is based on two shorts by Andre Dubus, whose `Killings' became `In the Bedroom').But sorry, Updike is not my favorite author, and the film's touch is too desultory for me. No, `desultory' is not the only real problem because I remember I was fascinated by the desultory realism of much more successful `In the Bedroom.' The real flaw of `We Don't Live Here Any More' is its dullness and all too familiar things about the four principal characters. Mark Ruffalo's character Jack is having affair with Naomi Watt's Edith and Jack's wife (Laura Dern) already suspects, or knows that his husband is cheating. But the affair means here uninspired, clichd sex scenes between Edith and Jack among the woods in Oregon, with Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo having sex against a tree ala `Fatal Attraction.' Edith husband Hank (Peter Krause) teaches creative writing, and has just one book published. The alcoholism of Laura Dern's character is suggested in the most obvious way (you know what), but in the first place why didn't the filmmakers realize that her portrait as poor housekeeper with alcoholism is already a big clich?Among these recycled materials, there are a few well-observed descriptions that deserve attention. It is the brief, but efficient study of the children in both families, and the film shows how these children accept the reality of the marriage that is falling apart. These clever, insightful moments, however, do not last long in the film, for it soon returns to the typical representation of the domestic life in America. We don't want any big surprises, or twists and turns in this kind of film because we know we have none from the beginning. It is true that `We Don't Live Here Any More' presents a convincing portrait of boring and stagnant marriage in a slumbering small town in America, but the film goes nowhere from there, missing every chance for the more incisive study of the characters.
I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up.
i love norm macdonald and this is the dumbest movie of all tim
This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence
Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?     
This has to be Stephen King's worst work adapted. This adaptation is even worse than Needful Things. Children Of The Corn (I am talking about the original and not the crappy sequels) was miles abouve better than this garbage. Just a stupid movie adapted from a lame book. Just plain trash
This review may sound pretentious and ignorant, but in truth I'm a big fan of British history, so bear with me!  Even as a film itself, it's surreal, and I don't like the acting.  But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys!  Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!?  Never!Historically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird.  Avoid this film today, folks!
Lame! Lame! Lame! Corny sexual humour. No wonder it tanked- if the Amazon.com thing is true. Because it's bad. Don't watch it unless you think e*ections are one of the funniest things in the whole entire world
this movie started out good but then got all mushy with the action and the gunfire. good snowboarding stunts, and the cast is great, Sawa looks a little scruffy looking. like I said, with the snowboarding and action, dont mix well and it gets muddled when the badguys come alon
This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet
