The quality is much better than expected. I bought one for myself and one for my husband prior to our Las Vegas trip Sept. 6, 2005. We were able to walk with or hands free because these fannypacks held all of the necessities, our cell phones, travelers checks, keys, and medicines in particular. We love the spacious divided compartments. I highly reccommend this product..
Okay, this cap is really stylish. But I think the sewing isn't quite finished. There were loose threads all over my caps when I got them. Not to mention the parts that weren't even sewed... no threads at all
I'm taking off one point only because these pants don't have the short/medium/long choice as other BDU pants do.  I'm buying for a friend who prefers long inseam and regular waistline.  For other BDU pants I could have got him medium long which has waistline of 31-34'' and inseam up to 34-35''.  For this particular style I was told over the phone that they don't carry the short/medium/long varieties and my only chance of getting an inseam of 34-35'' would be to go for the large size which also has a waistline of 35-39''.  I ended up getting the large one as suggested which is a bit too wide for my friend.Other than that I'm happy with the product quality and the service I received
This is just the thing to put away for a Christmas gift.  Nice product in a nice box, tied with a bow.
I had never ordered from this company before. I have now ordered quite a few things from them. For the price, everything has been very attractive. Some of the sizes run a bit small.This dress is very sweet, the PAPRIKA color is an orange, but I ordered 3 of these in different colors. Nice to wear around the house during the summer.( I also ordered a nice dress in EGGPLANT, but it is really brown, alright with me, a nice dress.)Customer Service was very good to me, and I even received a coupon for 3 free magazine subscriptions, as I had ordered over a certain amount from Newport News.I am happy with the price vs. quality of all of their things. Shipping was very speedy.For these prices you do not get the quality of Neiman's, Sak's, or Bloomie's  - but you get many more nice, simple, summer dresses, of a decent quality. I think that Newport News offers good value, and service for the money
The Nine West Botamy boots are comfortable and really well made. The leather is very soft also. Even though the toe is very pointed, these boots are still comfortable. Amazon has a great price on these boots
it means so much to me to be able to buy a pair of jeans that fit me in length.  ya who.Am
My friend was very happy with them.  They are very good quality, and they fit him for the most part.  The only issue we had was the length of the arms.  They were a little too long.  Other than that, we were pleased.  They got here in time for Christmas, and they were just what he wanted
i purchased this bag recently for an overseas trip (along with the 20" nxt roller) and i'm very happy with it.  the styling and fit is excellent, and it holds more than i expected.  it's comfortable to hold in your hand or to sling over your shoulder.  i purchased the black version.  with victorinox's lifetime guarantee you can't go wrong!  amazon.com is very competitive on price on this bag, and though there were a few stores that were cheaper i felt it was worth it to go with amazon if only because i trust them
ordering was easy, arrived in 4 days, gloves fit, well and good quality, good buy,recommend  to purchas
I never seem to have luck shopping for bras, so just took a chance on these off of another review that I had read.  They were a great deal and a wonderful fit.  I would highly recommend
Ordering online and not being able to try on clothing can be risky but it paid off with this purchase. I just wish it wasn't "hand wash only".
I love Puma shoes--especially the Future Cat Low.  Puma is by far the best quality sneaker I've ever had.  The price of their shoes is a bit more than the average, but you get what you pay for.  They are great-looking and are extremely comfortable.  I am so pleased with these shoes that I plan on only purchasing sneakers from Puma from now on.  I've bought four different Future Cats: dark shadow/persimmon orange, black/white/Chinese red, white/black/vapour blue, and black coffee/white/burnt olive
These shoes are so comfy!  I love the no shoe string thing too.  Easy and comfortable.  What more could you ask for
Podría ser extraño regalar una prenda de ropa íntima, pero estos Boxer son lo máximo para regalar desde un primo hasta a un compañero de estudios, y claro para la pareja - e incluso para chicas. Son de algodón, muy suaves frescos y ligeros. Los compré talla M y auqnue son para un caballero delgado uno M de Medio llenito los puede usar con comodidad. Para mi gusto son un poco largos, pero eso también provee de comodidad a su usuario. esto es más que una prenda de ropa interior es algo que provoca lucir y ver lucir. El estampado fue toda una celebración "Saluda a mi pequeño amigo"!!!!!!, con este Boxer puedes pasearte en interiores en tu casa y a nadie le va a molestar
This is a nice shirt, not as warm as we had hoped though. The lining is quite thin. It washes fairly well, loses a bit of its shape but not a lot. A great shirt for the fall. Its roomy & comfortable
 FIT IS PERFECT.  VERY COMFORTABLE.  4 STARS.   WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN.                              MARY S
My boyfriend loves tommy socks but they are impossible to find in New Mexico and I have looked everywhere for them.  I gave them to him for christmas and he thought they were the greates
Stretches to fit you exactly.  The smooth fabric holds everything in place.  Contrast waistband and package support make this underwear look very sexy.  Highly recommended
This is a lovely, lovely bra.  It supports, lifts, and minimizes, creating a flattering shape underneath clothing.  The wide straps are gentle on the shoulders, leaving no ugly marks after long periods of wear.  The back doesn't ride up, and the three hooks serve as a strong anchor.  The plunging lace neckline is invisible even under a tight t-shirt, and dare I say it, looks pretty sexy.  Yes, you can be well supported and attractive- bless ye, St. Olga
These are comfortable slippers that -- with composite soles -- can take you out on the deck, to the front steps or even your driveway to pick up the morning newspaper. Your feet will stay warm but not uncomfortably so. They're even nice to wear when temps are a little higher because the clog design fits loosely at the heal so you can let your feet "breath" a little fresh air. Nice value for the price
WOW.. what can't I say about these shoes... I've bought two pair in different colors & absolutely LOVE them for their comfort and snazzy, fun appearance. They're great at work and at play, and even during outings that require alot of walking. Highly recommend!!
I have received countless compliments on these rain boots. I love them, and I guarantee you will too! They are comfortable, stylish, and keep your feet dry in snow and rain. What a great purchase
There aren't many articles of clothing that allow people to support their favorite team, as well as appear smart and sexy at the same time. Red Sox hats, however, are just such an item. Go Sox
I was very happy with my last order. It was easy to order and didn't take long to get the product. My grandson was a very happy little boy on christmas morning. Thank you so much for the great services.I will use amazon again and tell my friends about i
These work great - but its important to know that these are adjustable! It doesn't say so on the box, so when I first got them I thought they were way too small for adult heads and I was quite annoyed - however, you can adjust them once you put them on, just pull very slightly and they will adjust to make them fit perfectly
  Purchased for our 6 ft 7 son and he is very pleased with them. They fit very comfortable and are long enough so that they do not come out of his belt line
the price for the bundle is the best part of the whole thing. [...] doesnt carry these products. they sell an adapter and then a usb cord. which is what apple does for their ipods and is a rip off for money.i like not having to worry with an annoying adapter when i want to charge my Zen. just plug in and walk away, not fiddle with the adapter to make sure it is inserted properly.the case is abit annoying. it catches lint like you wouldnt believe. but i'm not getting scratches and I HAVE A KICK STAND! i use that kick stand the most - its actually the main reason i bought this set.the bundle actually also arrived a few days before the Zen actually did, so it was sent FAST.i love this.get it
The leather was good quality.  The wallet was well constructed.  I gave it as a gift and it turned out better than I it looked on the internet.  Grade A product
This is very comfy and pretty and a great price . Try it you will be sold. I am glad I did
I've been buying these sandals for 30 years.  I just love them
I am enjoying the sneakers this Summer.  Comfy & perfect for elliptical trainer, stationery bike and weight room.  Very stylish, I love Skechers footwear
I am thrilled to finally purchase Birkenstock at a price that is fair. Our local retail stores,mark them up, so ridiculously. Thank you, Amazon
The Lands End 60/40 Oxford is THE dress shirt to own!  It is the end of the line in your search for an excellent product!  I buy nothing but this shirt, and have multiple shirts in each color made.  I've worn a shirt and tie nearly every day since I was 16 years old in prep school (35 years now), and the Lands End is the best.  I highly recommend this shirt
I was shocked to see how high the heel was, and being in my 40s I wasn't sure if I wanted to find out how they felt.  But I had a company dinner party and wore them and was surprised at how "walkable" and comfortable they were.  I have worn them several times since then
These are great socks.  In the description it mentions that they fit sock sizes 10-13.  I assume that is the same as shoe size, but it is not explained.  This, however, is an important point, since I wear a size 10 shoe.  I can wear the socks and I really like them but I wish they were a little smaller.  One size does not fit all.
Amazon notes that these socks are "only made from the finest yarns." They mean it, too! These socks keep your feet warm with their wool fiber; and they are very well made and last forever. I especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wear. Oh sure, these socks may cost a bit more--but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves. The socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is almost one size fits all. A big plus! I also like that the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers. Great!I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they will "bunch up" when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature.Overall, you can't go wrong buying these socks. They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get your money's worth. A good deal!SMILE
Great product--just what I was looking for.  Service was excellent and shipping was prompt.  Thank you, thank you, thank you
These are my new favorite boots!  The detailing on them is gorgeous and although they are quite high heels, they have a bit of a platform so I do not feel wobbly at all on them.  I'm really happy with my purchase
I buy these wherever I can find them.  It's a bit of a tribute to my aunt, for her middle name, but wish I could find them more frequently. 
These shirts are hard to find during certain seasons.  I was very happy to find that Amazon had them.  The quality of these shirts have lasted a long time.  The fit is perfect and comfortable
I actually purchased a 9.5 and felt they were a little too big and then ordered a size 9.  The 9 didn't fit well the arch was too short, so I sent them back and kept the 9.5.  They are very nice, I've been looking for a nice pair of boots for 5 years.  I get a lot of compliments, from people of all ages (20-65).  Not too young looking, not too old looking.  They are the perfect boot.  One little negative....I needed to put in a pad for the front part of my foot - not a lot of cushion.  After that I can wear them all day long.  I should have ordered them in brown!!
I got this hat because it reminded me of what Jack Nicholson wore in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I'm happy to say it also keeps my head quite warm. Cashmere is very soft and it breathes well (my head never feels too hot)
The robe arrive in great condition and in a timely manner. My boyfriend absolutely loved his Christmas gift! Thanks again! :-
Great company to order from... good product and got to me faster than any other order
These shoes exceeded my expectations, in that they are very lightweight.  The soles are made of some kind of stiff foam instead of solid rubber.  Time will tell how it wears compared to rubber, but the shoes are noticeably lighter than the last pair I owned.   They look good, they are very comfortable--very little, if any, break-in time.  If you like the look, it's a safe buy--you won't be disappointed with the build and feel
These SOX are the BEST my husband has ever used. He has asked for me to buy more and he has thrown all his other over the calf sox into the trash. He has been in construction for almost 30 yrs and has never been happy w/any sox I have found for him until now. These make him VERY HAPPY!! Thank You
We needed some plastic coated bibs once we started solids and started with those super stiff plastic ones from Babies R Us.  The stiff bibs were great for keeping her clothes dry when she would keep her bib off of her high chair.  We've got a Svan high chair (the best!) that has a pretty small opening for the kid's torso, so a stiff bib that you are constantly stuffing in there is such a pain.  Also, when cleaning, if you got the back (fabric) side of the bib wet, the bib would be cold and wet for hours.  The bumkins bibs can be washed thorougly with soap and water in the sink and then hung up.  They will be totally dry by the next meal!  They are so soft that our daugher doesn't mind wearing them.  They do not get in the way and stay nicely tucked (assuming our daughter doesn't pull the bib up to look for "bib goodies" in the pocket).  We bought 2 sets and could easily use more.  They can also be washed in the washing machine (no dryer but they air dry super fast)
I was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years, yet wasn't going to take years to pay for!  (HA! HA!)  This is a nice checkbook cover for the money.  My only complaint is that it needs to have a "tab" to keep your check register open to the page you are working on.  However, it does have a "loop" to keep a pen inside, you should desire to do so.  All in all, a good buy
These socks are wonderful.  Just the right weight, very comfortable and warm.Don't fade after washing, etc. etc.   I purchased 6 pair two months ago and have purchased 6 more
I love these bras so much! They are so comfortable, any other bra I wear now feels weird. The only thing i noticed was the lacy edging started bubbling after about two months of washing and drying, otherwise their my very favorite bras
Like wearing a moccasin only with more support. More supple than most Driving Shoes, and light weight too. Soles wear very well, as do uppers. A Great looking shoe that has become my favorite knocking around shoe, yet plenty dressy for evenings eating out in Southern Cal
Purchased this for my girlfriend.  Told me that fits well and was very happy with this.  I am glad to get such a good price on them too
For the price, these bags cannot be beat!  There aren't terribly large, but they are just the right size to fit the goodies that I purchased for my girls.  I am having them personalized and they will be ready to give
I wouldn't say they're my favorite pair, but I definitely like them.  Soft, Comfortable, Sexy
My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter.  They are perfect, washing easily, and retaining their size and color
Quality product, exactly what I wanted, but it runs large. I wear a half size, bought the size larger & now think I'll buy the smaller size
i made a poopie in my pantys so you are mean i love camo hats i'm 5 and i live in new york city in a apratmant that is fancy so you are stupiodo haeds.ps im in the army
My husband is a big man and very rough on belts.  Most belts last him a few weeks.  This one has lasted him 3+ years.  The only reason I'm buying him a new one is because he's lost so much weight.  There's still 'lots of miles' left in the belt I'm replacing.  Definitely got our money's worth out of it
These are perfect for low-rise pants. The cut will likely be flattering for any guy. The front pouch design allows for maximum comfort and moveability, and I find the fit in the back to be basically great. An essential for those whose jeans hang low
This is a great and comfortable bra, and it works for me. It's a MINIMIZER, and is great for larger sizes. I exercise a lot and it provides great support, even good enough for running on the treadmill. I have a few of these same bras that have lasted several years. I am so impressed with them that I looked up the tag numbers on the bras and found this site to purchase more, and it is half of what I paid in the mall. Now it is all I wear for everyday :)
Once while traveling, I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either. I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home. It's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and sandals.
I have purchased several shoes from Nine West and for the price these are very comfortable boots and of good quality. I would highly recommend them because they are the kind of boot you can wear all day long. The calf of the boot is very generous and the heel height is exquisive for walking in fashion.
My son really liked this, although I recommend that you check sizes exactly as I thought that a size L Big kids would be big but it is just the right size for an 11 or 12 year old
My husband thought this was a great shirt as an avid golfer.
The shoes are not exactly what I wanted bacause I was trying to get the same shoe that I had purchased some years ago. Times change and so does style. I searched everywhere and these were the closest to what I wanted. The Keds shoes from Amazon which I ordered and received on time might I add, were more like what we used to call Bo Bos and the rhyme used to go like this..... "Bo Bos they make your feet feel fine, Bo Bos they cost a dollar 99, Bo Bos." Don't know who made it up even but that was the rhyme we used to sing. I can't explain exactly how the older pair is but there is a slight look and feel of a difference. I still like the older ones better. Not sure if I'll ever find the same ones again. Oh and one last thing, if I could give shoe and clothing stores one tip, it would be to make adult sizes for the children's items. They make some really cool things for kids today. Like the Keds Girls' Jazzy Sneaker. Hope it's not just because I haven't grown up yet
This is absolutely one of the most comfortable heels I have in my closet.great buy good pric
Oh my gosh!  I was so excited to see this item.  My 15 year old and all of his buddies are big fans of Napoleon Dynamite and this t-shirt is an exact replica of the one worn during the famous election rally dance!  I will be a hit on Valentine's Day with this gift!
This is my 2nd set of these type of curlers.  The last ones stayed with me for three years.  They are so good, I stopped using the "big, home set" and use these type daily.   Heat up fast, great lasting curl (particularly for hard to curl fine hair), and don't even need to leave them in that long.Would have given them a 5 - but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl.   Recommend getting or using a set of the old-fashioned wire clips that come with most non-travel sets if you want a smoother curl
BEWARE:  This bra WILL increase the appearance of your breasts a full cup size or more!  The only draw back to acquiring this bra is slyly wearing it without family and co-workers knowing something's up.This bra is made from good materials.  The cups are thick and smooth and the straps are study and comfortable. The liquid is ample but not noisy or lumpy.  The cup fabric is itchy at first, but a handwash in woolite will fix that. The only problem I have, is that this bra doesn't push the breasts up to the cup!  I prefer low-cut blouses and would feel more confident in a "push-up" design.Otherwise, it's a truly effective bra to give you non-surgical results
the shoes were in great shape, the shipping speed was fast, really satisfie
Great delivery & of a quality product and the speedy service is one reason i still use amazon today is b/c of sellers and products like this 2 thumbs up !
I just love different and odd things. I love to give people gifts that no one else have.Thanks
I LOVE my soft and comfortable green robe that I received last year for Mother's Day! Whenever I wear it, I want to just relax with a magazine or watch TV, and then fall asleep in it. The matching green slippers complete the feel, and I really feel pampered. I never knew I could feel SO good wearing a robe, especially since I was not really a robe wearer before receiving this wonderful plush robe! This is such an excellent product and great gift!
Comfortable. If elastic waist degrades over time (not known yet, but has happened to other pajamas), there is no back-up draw-string. As with all flannel PJs, easily tangles with flannel sheets
It is exactly what I was looking for. I had no problems ordering or receiving it. I got to my house quickly. Nothing is wrong with it
Most sneakers these days come in two varieties--they're huge athletic clod-hoppers for teenieboppers, or they're white keds or orthotic shoes for old ladies.This sneaker is the best compromise on the market today.  It's youthful without being for the young.  Light-weight, low-profile, wide enough for a thick sock, and it'll get you compliments everywhere you go.My first pair is in black, and wow, they are stylish.  Today I wore them out shopping, and my back started hurting before my feet did.  My one objection is this supposedly 'squishy' foot bed.  I don't know if my shoes were missing that part or what, but I found the sole to be hard and inflexible.  They were still _comfortable_ but it wasn't like putting your feet on pillows or anything.If you do prefer a squishier footbed, I recommend a thin insert, so as not to squish your toes.  I'm not sure if they would perform well for athletics--I'm going to be saving mine for errands and casual nights out, but I want these in every color
This is a great bra for any mother that is looking for a nursing bra!  I live in the US and had a terrible time finding this bra in any store or anywhere on line.  It's a fabulous bra. It's very comfortable, washed up nicely and provides great support.  This is our second child and I wish I had these with the first
I like adidas brand and this is a great shirt for working out or whatever. It is comfortable and well worth it
This is really a great item, very comfortable.  I would have no problem wearing them for more than girlfriend if the opening was not so loose.  Great for the intended purpose though
THIS WAS AT 1OTH BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY SON.WE ARE CALIFORNIA TRANSPLANTS LIVING IN TEXAS, AND NO ONE HERE, AT THE TIME, HAD ANY IDEA THAT KOBE HAD EVEN CHANGED HIS NUMBER FROM 8 TO 24. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE (AND A LOT OF DRIVING AROUND) TRYING TO FIND KB'S 24. I FOUND IT ON YOUR SITE AND THE PRODUCT WAS JUST WHAT I EXPECTED, NO SURPRISES.  MY SON LOVES IT!
I received these slippers for Christmas in December 2005. I got the Pine green, a very nice looking slipper with lots of comfort. I am ordering another pair in Charcoal, as I want 2 pairs to have at both places I live. It's all about comfort for me when I am home, so these fit the bill. Good value as well
I have owned and worn this for several months now, and it is very durable AND warm as well! I would just be cautious about the unisex sizing, as I am a Medium sized person (10-12) and it does seem to be a little large, yet I wear it anyways.  Hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size
Munsingwear is definitely the most comfortable, best fitting men's brief I have ever worn
Plugged into Ipod and guess what! Audio and video came out the other end! A little spendy but what can ya do
This is the best sports bra I've ever had!  I show dogs for a hobby and was always aware that, as I gaited the dog around the ring, I was bouncing!  Now, no more bounce and extreme comfort.  I've had the bras for over 6 months now and they've held up well.  Everyone that I've recommended the bra to has had similar experiences
This is a one of a kind handbag.  Great on a night out or just for kicks!  Unbeatable price for such a genuine item.  Don't have one?Get One!http://handbags.freepay.com/?r=27259751
Even if you could never see yourself wearing this. Go ahead and get it anyway.This is great for under the football helmet & for under the motorcycle helmet. Feels good on your head. I have even seen wrestlers wear these under headgear so it must be good for that too. keeps your head dry.I also wore this under my mask when volunteering @ a haunted house
I ordered this shirt hoping it matched 5 others I had bought at a storefor my wedding party. I called the company, they explained the shirt in detail. I ordered it and received it promptly, and it was a perfect match.Thank Yo
No Complaints. Everything ran smoothly. I recommend this seller and this product to everyone. They are absolutely great, and they were exactly as described/pictured
Incredible boot!  Comfort, style and warmth have proved their way with this boot.  I get positive comments each time I wear them!  The tread is perfect for walking in snow pack too.  You don't slide a bit.  I'll enjoy these for years
I wear this shirt waiting tables and I reccomend it to anyone.  When washed it is wrinkle free and can survive many washings.  The larger size is very roomy and sleeve length is appropriate for long arms.  I only wish it came in a broad collar instead of just a point color, but still an excellent shirt
This case is so cute and matches my green iPod perfectly.  I read other reviews that said it leaves little black fuzz on the iPod, but I haven't had that problem.  The belt clip works great with this and feels very secure.  The other review said the cut-out for the wheel is off a little, and I guess she is right.  Looking at it you can see just slightly that the wheel isn't centered, but it is completely accesible and I have no trouble using it.  Overall I love this case
Mom was looking for a similar item, from "Bass".  I told her this brand was very reliable.  She can put them down
My 9 year old nephew told me he wanted "Under Armour" for Christmas. I had no idea what he was talking about. I asked - "Under arm deoderant"? "Undershirt"? I was ever the un-cool aunt for not knowing what he wanted. I found out that 3 of my friends experienced the same thing. ;)  The shirt runs very tight, and even though my nephew is smaller for his age, the large just barely fit him. He asked for a second one for his birthday (and so did my sister, so she could get the shirt off of him and wash it). The kid loves it, and if he gives it 5 stars, so do I.
With the sale and promotional rate applied. This is a great shoe
Great looking on my feet, extremely comfortable and the price for a suede sandal like this is phenomenal!  I'm going to order more. 
Exactly as advertised. If you're a Naruto nut, or like wristbands, I'd advise buying this
Sexy and well made. I am a size 12, but I bought the queen size and it fit great
Rubber boots don't have to look like booring rubber boots. I ordered Women's Tan "Beach Holiday" boots for my daughter as a Christmas present. They arrived in time for Christmas and she loves them
These are great blades, installation is very straight forward.  The only gripe I have about these blades is the contact of the blade and the windshield at the extreme right where it ceases to touch my windshield which is about a 1/2", but the odd thing is that the tip does touch my windshield on the up stroke.  But it is so minor that it would not affect the rating at all since these blades has to fit onto so many different cars.  I guess there are no replacement for factory blades
The Organizer works well for keeping disparate shopping items from rolling around in the back of the car.  I do wish the partitions were actually attachable by velcro to the organizer and soft.  The hard plastic partitions is this Organizer are simply square plates that can be stuck in between items.  I tend to not use them since they don't even work to soften the bumps between jossling items. My husband's trunk organizer (which I didn't buy because it cost 3x as much) has the softer, attachable partitions.  I guess that would be worth the money in retrospect for MY needs.  But in all this is great for the price. Now I get to the office, or home, and easily carry everything in at once to unload
I just bought a new white convertible and this product is the greatest for quickly removing dust and light dirt. I am using it daily as it is so easy and quick. Car is spotless after 3 weeks of heavy driving, and I haven't needed to use my free car wash from the dealer
I kept getting tickets in the mail for going through EZ pass tool booth out here in New York city. My sticker was valid and I had money in my account. They had no reason to keep sending me violation tickets in the mail. Each time I wrote them a letter explaining the circumstances and asked that they void the tickets. They told the system had problems and they would fix it. Well I put a stop to it when I ordered 2 reflectors for my cars. I have not had any tickets in the mail since. I love this product. It is so simple and yet effective. Everyone should get it. The best $50 I have spent lately
Many years back I worked retail and the shelves in my store were all black and our district office always sent us these dusters to clean the shelves with.  So, now many years down the road we refurnished our living room w/ black furniture and the first thing I did was go out and get one of these.  It is the best thing ever for dusting!  It leaves absolutely NO lint behind and works like a charm! 
This is a much nicer seat cover than I imagined it would be (especially for the cost).  The only complaint I have is that with it in place, I can't extend my head rest (I'm tall), but other than that, it's very comfortable, and protects the car seat under it very well.  I wear suspenders, and without something to protect the seat, the car seat gets cut by the buckles
T. Dorau -- when properly stored, what you complain about will never happen.  A battery should -never- be stored in sub-zero or near-freezing temperatures.  Don't leave it in the garage!This unit offers "quick" recharging (4 to 5 hours) from a 12V source or gradual recharging (12 to 24 hours) from an AC source.The AC source may be left connected indefinitely (true "float" charging) which is a plus for a standby power source.  The inclusion of the LED light source is very thoughtful on the part of the designer(s).In addition to jump starting a car, this is a good choice for small household items (TV, Radio, Weather Alert Radio) or emergency communications equipment (CB, Ham Radio).This product also appears in some stores under the "Husky" and "Vector" brand-names
I have used these to change the oil on my 2006 Chevy Silverado 4x4.  They work like a champ.  There is plenty of room underneath.  They seem very sturdy.  My only complaint is - my truck kept moving the ramps.  I had to put it in 4 wheel drive to get up them.  This should not be an issue with a front wheel drive.  I also have a 2001 Nissan Maxima.  The ramps fit under the air dam nicely on the Nissan.  I will use these for that vehicle also.  One last note:  The name implies these ramps can hold 12,000 lbs.  This is not the case.  They are actually rated at 3,000 lbs each.  This is plenty of capacity for my full size truck, and for any car I know of
We've been using this water blade as a shower squeegee -- it is the most effective tool we've found to remove the water from the walls of our shower. It's large and efficient.
Well made tool.  Can seem to be a bit heavy.  Cleans well.  It was shipped lazer fast
fast shipping... great product .. very easy to use.. i highly reccomend this product if you dont want to deal with complicated wiring and difficult to install alarms. this products works fine and VERY easy to work with
My MV-50 just arrived tonight and it worked fine, it would have made sense if it had a cigarette adaptor than having to use the battery. The gauge starts off from zero and increments by 5psi, so it is off by 5psi! The gauge reads: 0,5,10,15,20,25. At 20psi, it is showing 25psi.  The only confusion is what I found on the internet for some people paying only $25 for this and not $70 plus shipping charges.The connector is not useful for tight spaces, like a rear motorcycle tire on my Yamaha 650 Maxim. I think it is going to perform to my racing needs.
Very nice kit and bag.  Only drawback is that it doesn't have flares
great item at a great price... I bought two for a bit more than one at local stores..
I live in germany and my friend bring me the AutoDry to germany.I washed my black Tahoe in the sun..and IT WORKS!! GREAT!! But, you need a good water pressure, that the water is strong enough to wash the hard dirt away.Regards from GermanyTobia
There's nothing worse than having that "Service Engine Soon" or "Check Engine" light come on. This scanner can give you some idea of what is going on under your car's hood. Easy to attach connector and simple navigation screens. Too bad it can't tell you how much the repairs will cost you
This product satisfies about 95% of what I wanted it to.  It accomplishes the purpose - keeping the dog from jumping into the backseat.  However, the bottom stabilizing feet are a little awkward to adjust and tend to fall out of the apparatus if you don't secure them.  I also had a little trouble keeping the horizontal bar parts from slipping downward.  Overall, this product was worth the $26 or so dollars I paid for it
Everyone should own this product. I receieved my item on the day I was told it would arrive, and it looked exactly like the picture
This is one honker of a tire pressure gauge.  Good long reach for my F350 dually tires from the rubber handle dual foot valve via a flexible hose to a meter with a big display.  After one day's use, I don't see why the display doesn't always engage, but poking it onto the valve stem gets it going OK.  Instructions not obvious that you must remove the red strip that protects the batteries.  Also not obvious how to get to the batteries, whatever they are, but I'll figure it out.  I may try another reviewer's idea to bend it 5 degrees for easier access thru the access holes to the valve.  Gotta use it a bit longer first.Sure is a good gauge in any case
the negative reviews of this thing most fall under that category of "it took too long" well that would be because you didn't let the oil warm up before trying to suck it through a thin piece of tubing...idiot.if you follow the directions this thing works great, 5 stars & I would buy it again in a heartbeat
I bought this to use on a BMW motorcycle because it has awkward access to the pressure valve on the rims. It works beautifully and the spoken measurement is very handy when you can't see the readout. The readings are consistent with other gauges which I believe to be accurate so all in all this is a solid product and works as described
This is an all around great emergency product for both car and home.  They only thing is that I wish they had the dimensions so that I could have assessed whether it would be too big or small
I rate this product a 5 star, although I haven't used this product yet, decided to purchase it as a result of the review of motorcycle tire inflator's in the MOTORCYCLE CONUMER NEWS, just wanted to have one to carry in saddle bag of my HD Ultra Classic, in case it was needed
Since my daughter loves everything "TINK", and the local auto parts store didn't carry this Tinker Bell style, I decided to buy the one Amazon had. It turns out that she loves it, and it hold the CD's nice & snug too. Very well made
Been using Mr Clean AutoDry system for a while now.  As long as the filter refill is not used up (stops deionizing the water), you'll get a nice sheeting effect when you rinse the vehicle off, allowing it to dry spot-free.  The thing you have to remember is that this isn't a pressure washer, or anything other than a system.  You have to wet the vehicle, wash with the system's soap, and then rinse with normal water.  When you're ready to dry, use the filtered water, and then let dry!  Best if you wash your vehicle in a shaded area, or the soap/rinse water will dry leaving spots.The only negative I have with it is that it doesn't last very long when you've got a full-size truck and a minivan that needs washing.  After 2-3 washes of my vehicles (total, not each!) the filter doesn't deionize as well.  But sure does make drying much easier on these big vehicles!  No more hand drying for me
we have these in those hard to see parts of the cupboard.One tap it is on and another it is off. LEDs are the way of the future
We got one to use on our cars a couple of years ago.  It wipes them almost dry.  It doesn't scratch because it is made of silicone.  Now we are using it in the shower and have to buy another for the cars.  I'm getting one with a handle to dry my camper, too.  I recommend them highly
The Mothers Powerball & Mini Powerball are outstanding. Recommend it to all car collectors. We just loved the way it works and the time it cuts down to polish crome wheels. Used the big ball on the pro-street wheels and the mini on the front. We'd still be polishing if it wasn't for the Mothers products.Great buy
This product just arrived. I am very impressed by the quality of the material and the zipper. I have adjusted the roof rack on my FJ Cruiser and may put something in the bottom of the carrier for support- we will see if that is needed. This product is cheaper and of higher quality than those seen in department stores
It does work very well once you decide on the best ceiling mount location.  I had to remount/move once to get the laser beam to hit the spot on the car dashboard that we wanted it to when the car was at its desired parking position.  The forward/backward adjustment of the laser after mounting the unit is helpful but not being able to adjust the laser side to side after mounting scored it a 4 instead of 5 star rating from me
Works very well, I suggest screwing the mount in as opposed to using the supplied tap
After trying just about every other pricier wiper blade on the market, and being disappointed every time, I decided to spring the extra money for this one (no, they are not cheap) and see if paying the extra money made all that much of a difference. I only bought one initially, on a rainy day when my driver side wiper had flown off the car on my way to work, and then immediately ran back and got one for the passenger side, too, after I'd only gone a mile down the road. These wipers are incredible. I swear my windshield looks better now than it ever has. No smearing, no streaking, and complete water removal. They also work better at removing bugs from the windshield in conjunction with the car window washer fluid than any other wiper I've ever used. Now I'm curious about the longevity of the wiper blade. I'm hoping they last longer than others, too (given the price.
I love Tink! I found this item to be very easy to put on my van steering wheel. It does not slide like others I have had before, but easy to remove too. 
This 16 ft. Coleman jumper cable is a 4 gauge cable which is a mechanic's grade.  It is durable and will last a long time.  The length ensures that you will be able to utilize this tool without worry, the clamps glow in the  dark and fit both side post and top post batteries.  It comes with a  lifetime warranty and I am very glad that I bought it
I had been looking for a new gauge, and really had my eyes on an analog dial type.  I found one surprisingly hard to find at local stores, so I was thrilled to find this one on Amazon, and at a really decent price.This Accu-gage model is simply great.  Solid construction and finish.  It's the perfect size.  Perhaps the best feature is the release valve function, which holds the acquired pressure reading from your tyre, until you press the little thumb button to release the air pressure from the gauge.Can't say any more about it other than 'works and looks great.
The product does just what it says it does.  It helped me realize my Mechanic was milking me for $800.00 when I could have fixed the problem myself for $107.00.  When I confronted my mechanic he said nothing because he knew he had been "had"
Okay, it is only the second portable air pump we have owned, but it far outlasted the first one! I suppose everyone's experiences are going to vary. We bought our "Truck Air" compressor in '98 for our three week road trip to Alaska (from Arizona!). After it died at the end of this past year, I figure we got more than our money's worth from it (BTW, I intend to buy the same one to replace it!). Seven years of topping off our cars' tires and helping others with roadside flats, filling basket balls and footballs, repeated fillings of a five gallon air tank (to 100psi!!) has proven to me that it has staying power. Not sure what to say about the negative comments on this site about the pump. No problems with ours at all (no "hot plug," plenty of psi, valve clamp always worked well, built in guage accurate to within 3 pounds, more than enough wiring to reach from the cigarette lighter to each of the four tires on our Tahoe)until I just "wore it out"! The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is a bit noisy - about as noisy as one of those "pay for air" compressors, but as I said, I still intend to purchase an identical unit, after a shop a bit for the best price. Oh, and another important point, it is "Made in the USA!
I purchased this product because my wife's 1997 Honda Accord's "Check Engine" light had come on.  It turned out to be an O2 sensor that was bad.The dealer wanted $110.00 for the diagnostic which they would apply towards the $300.65 (before taxes) O2 sensor + $85.00 in labor + shop supplies.  At a minimum, I was looking at over $400.00.  I only paid $95.00 for this product and I can get the same O2 sensor for $150.00 online.  I saved money the first time I used it and the tool paid for itself.In addition, I can use it for any of my friend's and family's vehicles.A must have for anyone wanting to save themselves time, money and frustration at the dealer
I was very upset to see a dent the size of a softball on the hood of my new BMW. The dent itself was not all that noticeable, but nonetheless an eye sore for me. After reading very mixed reviews about the Ding King, I had my doubts whether or not it would be effective. I was also very afraid that it would compound the damage. Because of the outrageously low price point, I took a gamble. I'm glad that I did. After three pops, my dent was gone. The process around using the product was simple, though a tad time consuming. I highly recommend this product to anyone with minor dents in their vehicle. I'm not sure if it'll work for everyone, but it worked for me. At $20, you can't go wrong
Used one for several years.  Saves the paint on your vehicle and removes a lot of snow with one swipe
Excellent product for the price....use a pre-wax cleaner 1st (Mother's #1)& then apply....goes on easily but do not let it dry too long before buffing it in; leaves a nice deep glossy shine...I've put 2 coats on so far this year & the car looks great
Product seemed good, got is as a gift for my mother but she decided to get a different color. The item was actually nice though.
I recently bought one of these to put in my wife's car. The kit is pretty complete and well organized; you could pick up most of the items over time and maybe save some money but I liked having the consolidated kit and particularly the air compressor. The bag itself is heavy nylon and has velcro on the bottom so it won't slide all over a carpeted area.
Easy on and off.  Can apply it in the sunlight.  Makes my Viper shine and the shine lasts a long time
This charger works great a charging a 12v battery.  It is very small and has two small clamps to attach to the battery.If your battery is in an out of the way spot, you have the option of attaching a 2nd set of cables which attach to the battery permanently. Then you just plug the charger into the loose end of the cable.  When done charging, unplug hide the cable
I have a detail shop that puts out about 400-500 vehicles a month.And we have been in business for 8 years now.  So you can say that i have seen or used just about everyones waxes/polishes. Mothers FX  works great on the old cars as well as the newest 2006 models. I have witnessed the best results with one simple application. And it does last quite some time. It is the BEST product that I have ever used on a black or dark colored vehicles. NO MORE SWIRLS !!  If applied right you will not experience those annoying swirls and small scratches that come with alot of the leading competitors.Anyone can use this. From large detail shops like my own to someone under a tree or at the local self service carwash.IT REALLY IS THAT EASY !! And this product goes a very long way if applied right also. We have been able to use 1 bottle to about 25 vehicles. So it is well worth the price.  So basically you cannot go wrong with Mothers Fx Synwax. It is the best from the best and used by the best in the business. 
I purchased this exact model and both clamps are METAL.Maybe it was an issue and they have changed the material.Seems very well designed and built.Much better quality than the no-name brands I saw elsewhere
It is a great item.  I just hope that I never have to use it
The colors were prefect for my car, blues and grays.  The soft velvet gives it a touch of richness.  The image is pretty, but could be a little better quality and well with the embordary.  The colors in the seat are more on the purple side and all the other "Moonsprite" items are blue, so not a prefect match.  Over all I am happy I got it
I have bought cheap blades at drugstores, they don't work well.  This one is truly quality, easy to install and it works better than any wiper blade I have ever purchased.  The price is low for such a great product
Scanner saved me a lot of time and money. I was able to find out what was wrong with my motorhome without taking it to a garage
I drive a special needs school bus all day, all year and have had this cushion for some time. They are light and easy to move between vehicles. I get about two years out of it, then just buy another. Don't spend more, you don't have to
My husband recently installed this in his car and loves it. It was a fairly simple installation and works just as promised
These are easy to use and easier to tighten than the pull through type tie downs.  These will work well to hold a riding lawnmower or golf cart on a light trailer.  They are also good in pickups to hold your load if you have  loops inside the bed.  If you're hauling anything heavier on a large  trailer, get some serious tie downs like the Keeper 05516's
For less than $200 you get a reader with a large backlit screen and one that can also give a live data feed from your car's sensors. It also supports CAN (controller area network) which by 2008 will be a new standard, a standard that Ford and foreign auto makers have already adopted. Did I mention it also comes with a serial cord to connect to your PC? This is a very fun DIY toy you'll enjoy for years
This is another nice Tinkerbell accessory for the car.  The graphic is nice looking.  The material appears to be good quality.  I expect it to last for some time
The scanner works great and the messages are understandable.The "Internet update" does not exist - vaporware.  How can they sell a cable without having the drivers available??  Dunno
This is the first clay bar system I used, and it's still the best. You absolutely need to use this before you wax, or else you're just waxing those impurities into your finish, creating more annoying swirl marks. Doing this step before you wax is a bit more work, but it's worth it. I could live without the Mother's wax they include with the kit, as I don't use it. But I always use this before I wax my car. That glass-like feeling your paint gets is amazing
I (and more importantly, my twin boys) really like this jumper.  It seems safer than the doorway jumper, mainly because their fingers won't get mushed.  I like that it has multiple height settings and that it's on a sturdy frame.  They love to jump in it, and before they were able to crawl, it was one of the few ways for them to get out some of that excess energy and get some exercise.  Plus, it's a nice safe place for times when I'd like to get something done without having to keep a constant eye on one of the babies.  The cons (that wouldn't keep me from buying it again) are: it takes up more room than a doorway jumper, the rattly bear is pretty loud, and the music is obnoxious.  There is an on-off switch and two volume settings for the music, though
I received this pack n' play for a shower present this weekend and it is absolutely adorable set up. It is very colorful and the the toys are cute. It was very easy to set-up. I am not good at putting things together and it took me about 5 minutes total. The matress comes out so you can put it on the floor with the toys overhead. It is very multi-functional
I purchases this basket for a friend. I was very pleased with its usefullness style. It arrived in two days of ordering
My son loves these blocks. We've also purchased the number blocks to go along with this set. He loves saying the colors, numbers and stacking them
I picked this monitor after reading many reviews.  The reviews didn't lie.  This monitor does great on distance.  I have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors.  The bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor.  I can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound.  I could hear him grunt even!  I don't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss.  You're given many channels in order to find the right strength.  I could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal (he was on opposite end of house upstairs).  I also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times, not getting it soaked.  Also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound (no radio or tv or mobile playing).  Great product, strongly recommend.  My son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great.  This monitor is the right choice for the average household.  Interference may come if you're on the same channel. I have wifi network, cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just don't know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product
The strap on mine broke and I was very quickly sent a replacement.  I expressed my concerns about the size of the belt( I have a small frame and it is big on me) and I was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it's done.  Very friendly, amazing customer service, that's hard to find these days! 
My son loves these blocks. We've also purchased the number blocks to go along with this set. He loves saying the colors, numbers and stacking them
This item is invaluable in preventing Plagiocephaly (flattening of the head)...I wish we had known about it for our twins.  Newborns especially need a very soft surface for their very soft and malleable skulls.  We used it for our third baby and as a result, he has a perfectly round head and proportioned features.  The incline greatly reduced spit up as the 'flap' between their esophagus and stomach is not developed yet.  Gravity prevents the milk/formula from traveling back up and causing gas and or spit up.  I've noticed the biggest complaint about this item is that infants seem to slip down in it during the night.  This is true, however, rolling up a receiving blanket real tight and placing it in a "U" shape under our son's bottom prevented this from happening ever again.  As a result, he slept soundly, never spit up once, never woke us up with gas pain and has a perfectly round head.  I strongly recommend the Boppy Noggin Nest as well to keep the pressure off the head when your baby is not in his crib.  Also, if your baby is old enough to roll over, this item is not for you.  One other note: the foam wedges on either side do trap some body heat, so don't over-swaddle or put too many layers on...adjust the thickness of your blanket to the ambient temperature.  I would say this is a good item for newborns to about 5 months. It made an enourmous difference in the well being of our third child compared to his older twin siblings
My Mom always said that the Rectal thermometer was the best but when she used the speed one on me I found out my temperature right away and that was so cool and I like how it even does it quicker rectally than orally so I dont mind a rectal temp now and you know what? My brothers are even doing it that way and one of them is 16 yrs old.
We love this item. I was so upset when we got this stroller due to the fact of not having a spot for a drink. This item solved the problem. Highly recommended
This gate us a lifesaver.  Not only do I pets, I have a very adventurus toddler.  This gate is sturdy and very durable.  It is very convienent because it is designed to fit in an area that isnt straight.  My living room has a curve to it so it fits great.  A wonderful item.  Thank you
I registered for this item as one of those "I wouldn't buy it but it's a nice thing to have". I did receive it and am so glad I did. My son loves this!! He gets so comfy and warm and will sleep for hours in this boppy lounger. I would defninitely recommend this and would buy more if I needed them
After checking out all of the boppys, I decided to get the bare naked one and purchase slipcovers.  I have received so many compliments on the pink slipcover -- even the nurses at the hospital loved it!  It is so soft, and I have washed it a few times with no problems (I haven't put it in the dryer, though).  It does not protect the boppy itself from spit-up, etc., of course, since it is not a waterproof cover.  However, I was not expecting it to be waterproof, and the regular boppys without slipcovers are not waterproof, so it's not a big deal to me.  Since I have the plain white boppy, nothing shows through, but this might be an issue for decorated boppys
Once my daughter grew out of her carters sleeved sleepsacks I was glad I bought these halo sleepsacks.  They are made from awesome fabrics and I like that the zipper ends at their feet (for easy diaper changes).  I highly recommend these to any new mom (or experienced mom).  It left me assured that my daughter didn't wake up in the morning with a blanket over her head.  She is a active baby in her crib. :
Our little 2 year old loves the feeding seat.  We love the fact that she is safely secured while feeding.  I was looking forward to the reclining feature as well, but it is very difficult to adjust and we never use that feature
Works great. We tried other brands of Gripe Water, which didn't seem to do much. Something about Baby's Bliss does the trick
We received the original co-sleeper as a gift.  We also considered getting a mini co-sleeper and a pack'n'play or similar playard.The main advantage of the co-sleeper is that you can attach it to your bed so you can reach your baby without getting up.  The original co-sleeper can also be used as a playard.  The playard capacity is up to 50 pounds, most brands are only rated to 30 lb.  Similarly the bassinet level rating is 30 lb. and most brands go to 15.  The co-sleeper itself is about 2 or 3 pounds heavier than a typical playard.  The width is 28" so the co-sleeper can go through our 29" doorways without collapsing, unlike several playards that are around 31".There is a trick to collapsing the top bars - you have to pull the bar upwards when you press the buttons, then it's easy.  (otherwise you can push until your thumbs are purple and nothing happens)  This is explained on their website and SHOULD have been included in the manual.I had a lot of reservations after reading other reviews here but am glad I chose to keep the co-sleeper and expect it to use it constantly.  Also, the Arm's Reach canopy is really strong and beautiful and I'm confident it'll keep the cats out
My son is tiny- born at 5lbs 6oz and very much a preemie. I simply cannot imagine putting him in the infant seat without this. It keeps his entire body in place- not just his head. It provides great support and the soft white fuzzy side is very warm (we havnt used the other side yet.) My only complaint is its a bit akward to get the shoulder straps in the correct place around baby- but thats mostly because our baby is still very tiny. once he;s bigger and we can move the headpiece up it shouldnt be a problem
Love these.  I use them everywhere.  I really can't imagine not having them, since my son throws down all plates and napkins still. 
I love this bath tub!  We were not happy with my son's infant bath tub, so we were anxious to move into this one!  It fits so nicely in the big tub and offers my son the added protection he needs.  When you're done with it, it just suctions to the bathroom wall to dry.  The best part is that we'll be able to deflate it and store it easily.  It's also great for traveling
This product helps my colicky baby sleep through the night, especially since she can't kick off the blankets. I highly recommend it.  Sizing is different than baby r us. I'm probably going to have to do some exchanges so thought I'd provide info.X-Small (Newborn) 5 to 10 lbsSmall (up to 6 months) 10 to 18 lbsMedium (6-12 months) 16 to 24 lbsLarge (12-18 months) 22 to 28 lbsX-Large (18-24 months) 26 to 36 lb
This high chair is so easy to put together and use.  My grand-daughter loves this chair, the music and toys on top occupy her.  I like how it changes height and reclines.  My grand-daughter was using this chair when she was 3 months.  The recline position came in handy!  I would buy this chair again and highly recommend it to friends and family
It fits our Baby Trend car seat, hooks easily to the LATCH anchor points, and in our mid-size sedan, leaves enough room in the back seat for an adult to sit on each side
This protects our leather seats well but is much wider than the infant carrier base which crowds the other passengers sitting next to the baby.  Otherwise a good product.
My sister has a small one bedroon apt and this product was perfect
My daughter recently had her second child, and spends alot of time breastfeeding. This product allows her to pump at her convenience. She can have others hold and feed the baby while she spends some time with her other child. The product works very well. She said it takes a little bit of experimenting and adjusting to get it set to work best for her, but it is an excellent product. She previously had a less expensive product by another manufacturer, and heard how good the Medela brand was from a friend. This brand is a pleasure to work with after using the less productive, noisier pump she had before. We would highly recommend this product, and the product is well worth the price paid
I wouldn't call this a "rocker seat" The kick-stand on it makes it look like a rocker, if you put the stand down..the legs almost touch the floor. You can make it move a little if you have wood floors, but not enough to call it a rocker. If you have a very mellow baby, this chair is perfect. My baby likes to sit and stare at the toys. But if you need any type of movement for your baby to stay calm, I wouldn't recommend this chair.The music/sounds on it is very nice, not annoying at all. I don't use the vibration on it yet, until my baby can itch his cheeks if needed. The only reason I say 4 stars and not 5 is because it is falsely advertised as a "rocker", other than that, it is very cute, and my baby enjoys it alot!
I purchased these for my Pack N' Play, and they are soft and durable.  A real must-have for pack-n-play owners
Heats milk and food esecially when frozen. I use a clean baby food jar to heat frozen baby food I've made
I bought the same brand, but maybe an newer/older version of this? It didn't have the book or the decogestant that is only for the older children that others have mentioned.  However, it DID have an Infant Tylenol equivelent, which we have been lucky enough to not have had to try yet.The gas drops are fantastic - thank goodness we had these, especially when we had to change his formula!!  Anytime our son was "fussy for no reason" we tried these drops first and it stopped the fussiness almost every time.  The saline drops are great and the nose drops have really helped during his colds. The aspirator works fine, I've never tried a different one, so can't compare.  He didn't care about the teething toy, and doesn't care for the taste of the teething gel, but it seems to work.  It also has two cooling wipes which we haven't had to use (no fevers yet!).Overall I was really glad to have this, and to have all these things together in a nice case I slid right under his changing table - no need to hunt for things in the middle of the night.  I'd recommend this to all new moms
My husband and I bought a second one after having had the first one for a little while for my 6 year old son.  He liked it so much that we bought another one for my almost 4 year old.  The seat is incredibly easy to clean (which is wonderful as the boys snack in the car a lot) and it's also so easy to fold and throw in the back of the car when we aren't using it.  Both boys feel very comfortable in it and seem to not mind riding in it for long periods of time. 
I own this blanket and just bought another! I brought this blanket to my playgroup at the park. It was perfect on the damp grass and big enough for me, my daughter, and all of our stuff. A few of the other moms liked it so much they bought it too. My baby spits up quite a bit, especially during tummy time, so I decided to buy another one to use in the house. It cleans so easily with a baby wipe or a damp cloth. Great investment
The mom who received this gift was very pleased with it
This is my second superyard. The first one I bought many years ago when the superyard was made with protruding metal hinges which were somewhat hazardous and invited mouthing by little teethers. Aside from being a little stiff to fold (which might be because it is new) this model is a vast improvment over the old. It's a couple of inches taller and seems sturdier. Great for blocking off the Christmas tree or any other part of the house. Cruising babies love to go round and round the inside and you can hang a busy box or other toys on the side to amuse a crawling baby. During football season, my friends and I take our superyards to tailgate and join them together to make a super superyard, so all the toddlers can safely play together. It's easy to clean using the pressure nozzle on the hose outdoors. Minor drawback is that it can be scooted across the floor or climbed out of by a determined toddler. Do I really need to say that any play yard should always be used only under adult supervision? Final comment - one of the most useful pieces of child-care equipment I've ever owned. The only reason I gave it 4 stars insteat of 5 is because my experiences with North States' customer service has been poor
This is a great sterilizer, it's chamber is big enough to holder 4 to 5 bottles wide neck bottles and the tray can hold quite a few nipples and cap rings.  I bought it when my son was born and after a year, I'm still using it.  It works great, saves time, and has an auto shut-off function when the steaming cycle is complete.
I bought this item a year ago and so far it is still in great shape.  We use it to hold all my little girl's stuffed animals and she has alot of them!  On occasions we do include her heavy toys -- no problem at all.  We live in an apt and it helps having a storage bin that doesn't take up too much space, but big enough to store away toys
It is still waiting for the baby to arrive, so I haven't used it yet....  but I do love the utility and design of it
We bought this for our son (now two), and he grabs his keys and phone whenever we are going in the car.  It gives him something to play with, and they aren't too noisy for long trips
I love these little books... they play music.. good for before bed, my girls can chew on them (which makes both me and my two year old son happy)...Just fantastic... great buy
When my son was born in May I tried the Dr Brown's bottles based on a co-worker's recommendation, and I am so glad I did!  My kids are all primarily breastfed, but for times when I need a bottle, Dr. Brown's are now the only ones I will use. My son is almost 4 months old now, and has had very little gas, and has never had any problems with colic! I wish I had had these bottles when my other children were babies.As for those whining about the extra parts to clean.. Puh-leeze! I hand-wash all my baby's bottles anyway, but did you know these bottles also include an extra thin bottle brush to clean the straws with?? Dr. Brown's makes it as easy on the parents as possible, but who doesn't take the extra time to make sure their baby has the best? With the little brush to use on the straw and vents, it really takes no time at all, so stop the nonsense. Anyone who is even halfway considering trying these bottles really should pick up ONE at least, but I know you will go out and get more if you do
This chair is a great space saver. Attaches easily to the chair, has two cup holders and the tray is the size of a normal high chair. The draw back is it's hard to adjust the seat for the infant. Was able to with some effort
This is a great potty for boys.  We had some problems with accidents with some other brands but this one keeps what should happen in the potty, in the potty.  Easy to clean, too
The only reason it is not a 5 is because they leave my nipples linty.  Otherwise they work really good.Tara Boyc
We got this before our little one was born. She was born a little premature and only 4 lbs. We used it in her bedside bassinet, and later in her crib. Although we had a few false alarms once she started moving around the crib, they were worth it for the peace of mind all the other hours. Baby girl is now two and we continue to use it. She's in a toddler bed now, and we can tell if she gets out of bed when she's not supposed to! This is a great device and everyone should have one. Comparible in price to other nursery monitors, you get so much more. It also has clear sound and little interference in our house
I bought the smaller version &quot;Diaper Decor&quot; (as opposed to the larger &quot;Diaper Decor Plus&quot;) about 18 months ago.  Although I believe the smaller version has been discontinued about a year ago, I have not yet had a problem finding the refill liners at my local Babies R Us or on-line here at Amazon.  I highly recommend the Diaper Decor. I do not have any experience with the Diaper Genie, so I cannot compare. I have not had any odor problems with the Diaper Decor.  It is very easy to change the liners and there is no mess. My foot-operated lid opener also broke like some other reviewers, but this has not been a problem with me.  I just open the lid manually and leave it open while I am changing the diaper. I would recommend the Diaper Decor in the Plus size
I have not gotten to use this swing yet, but I just wanted to say that assembly was easy and after I had it all put together I played with the toys on the tray and it was the coolest thing ever:)  I highly recommend
I bought this extra car seat base for my mom to use in her car and it works great! Now I don't have to switch the whole seat when Mom takes the baby. I am very happy with this purchase
We used this every single night with our son and even bought the next size up when he outgrew the small size. He was sleeping through the night almost immediately. Part of that was because he was so comfy when swaddled. We used this for four months until he learned to flip to his belly and needed his arms free. A def must have for every baby
I had checked out booster seats on the Internet and in stores and this was by far the least expensive.  It's a bargain -- well made and easy to use.  My grandkids seem to like it better than a high chair.  The seat arrived minus the safety straps used to attach it to a chair.  When I wrote customer service about the problem, they sent a whole new booster seat
I think this product is fantastic, the adjustable volume works well and the sounds are very soothing. The timer is also a nice feature. This is a great present for anyone in your life that is having a baby. The sheep is cute and  surprisingly cuddly in spite of the digital box in it's tummy.
This is such a versatile chair - love the way you can fold it down compactly, yet it's incredibly sturdy with the wide base when being used.The tray stores on the back legs when not in use - nice touch.For the reviewer who complained that the "thing that separates the legs" is attached to the tray - you can use the harness system to keep your child in place while removing the tray...  Plus it's easy to remove the top part of the tray and leave the base to keep the child secure while you clean up.My 6 month old loves to sit with us at the table with some toys on the tray - terrific product to keep babies happy and parents sane during mealtime
Kissaluvs are the best! They keep baby dry while being incredibly breathable.  Baby's skin doesn't get red like it does with disposable diapers.  Also great for keeping in those wonderful breastmilk poops.
True -- as other reviewers have stated, this is not a gate that will swing open unless you use the hardware, which I have not, so I cannot comment on how well that works. As a tension or pressure-mounted gate, I love this item. I have no problems stepping over it -- and I'm only 5' 5"-- so I never found it to be a nuisance. It's easy to use with one hand and snaps into place easily. It's also easy to adjust the size to fit different sized door openings, although that takes two hands. It's light enough that I can carry my 13-month old son on one arm and the gate in the other as I travel from floor to floor. My 2 year old is learning to sleep in a room by herself so we use the gate at the doorway so that she can call to us from her room without being free to wander into the hallway or onto the stairs. Again, we love the fact that we don't have to damage the molding on the doorframes.My husband and I are so satisfied with this item that we plan on buying another one
I like this product very much. It is very soft, unlike the other tubs where I was scared that my son would hit his head. The only drawback I have about is the belt....maybe in the next one they can come up with a good belt that would hold the infant. Other than that I  would recommend it to anyone. It looks very comfortable too. Especially if you have taller babies this is the best bathing system
      Limited space in our townhome, and this hook on chair has been wonderful for us. This is our "highchair".  Make sure you look at the clearance dimensions if you have a lip under your table.  The chair arms (attachments) may not clear the lip.      Strong, sturdy, easy to clean.  Knowing we can remove it and take it with us for a weekend visit is one less thing to worry about. Great travel drawstring bag.      Great price!!!  Great product.  If you take the time to read the instructions and not force things that shouldn't be forced, this seat will work out for you.     Something for the manufacturers, if they read these comments... personnal prefrence.  The harness straps should be a diffrent color then the seat.  Very hard to see/find when putting a baby in the seat, and its 5:00 in the morning
I and my wife have been very pleased with the Jeep Wrangler All-Weather umbrella stroller.  Unlike the cheap umbrella stroller we used to have, this one has better construction for the main folding support tubes. Plus, the handles are longer which means I (5'-1'' guy) don't have to walk like a neanderthal to push my toddler. The wheels do work pretty well on most surfaces even in very light snow.  The brakes are durable plastic and should last longer than my previous stroller. The pouches are an added plus for storing snacks or bus passes. My only disappointment has been the sun screen. It is not that useful for blocking the sun from my son's eyes unless I pull it directly in front of him. At that point, he can't see anything. That's OK if he falls asleep, but otherwise he (an independent todler) will pull the sunscreen off if it blocks his view.An added bonus would be a shoulder strap that I could use to carry the stroller for walking more than a few feet. While it's light and compact for a stroller, it is still cumbersome to carry if you have to fold it on the bus or walk anywhere with it. Frequently my son wants to walk so I take the stroller with me because I know he'll get tired. So again, a shoulder strap would make toting the stroller much easier
I too was given this pump by a lactation nurse, I pump at night after my baby goes to sleep. I think the pump is Great! It does what I need it to do and it very comfortable. The only drawback is that is is kind of loud. I would recommend this for a mother who needs to pump occassionally.
This monitor has kept me from ever wondering if my baby is breathing in the middle of the night. I test it frequently and it works. There has NEVER been a false alarm (everyone warned me I would lose my mind if it went off by accident, it hasn't). The only drawback, the channel is not so clear, there is static when you listen to it, but the peace of mind knowing he is ok is worth every penny. (I have a cheaper fisher price monitor for when I just want to monitor noise during the day, but I would not have another monitor for his bedroom.
this bag is great for a short trip. it has enough space for a few pampers, up to 2 bottles ...it depends on how well you can compact objects into a space. im a pro. with packing things away neatly in a small space so this bag works good for me!
Our grandson reciently came to live with us, nearly 2 years old and he refused to even sit on a potty. The day  our 1st pott arrived I opened the package and set the potty up in our bathroom next to the adult version hopeing this location would help. About 15 minutes later I noticed Drake had been very quiet.As I searched the house for him I discovered him not only sitting on the pot but he had actually used it ! He is now doing very well with his training ! The product is well constructed, easy to to set up, and easy to use 
We used the travelling toddler on our vacation with our 11 month-old son to Mexico.  We always buy him his own seat on the plane for his safety and it was a very convenient way to get through the airport with his seat and luggage.  He was attached to our rolling carry-on curbside and off we went.  We were able to check our stroller and we had little to carry.  At $20, you can't beat the price.  Our friends had to carry their car seat, stroller, luggage and child and were wishing they would have bought the strap
Pupsqueak is wonderful. I am a picky mother about toys. I hate toys that are too loud, too commercial, too cheesy, too useless...I have high standards. But Pupsqueak gets my "picky mom seal of approval" wholeheartedly. Here's why.I am very blessed to have a mother who loves to send my children lots of goodies. While it's easy to know what to send a 4-year-old with distinct likes and interests, it can be harder to gauge what a twelve-week-old baby will enjoy. We have no shortage of toys and gadgets to entertain our new daughter with, and she clearly enjoys some of them, kicking legs, cooing, , waving arms, etc.The Pupsqueak, however, took it to a different level. She LOVES this thing. We showed it to her around 11-12 weeks old, and she immediately reacted. She laughed, she kicked, all the signs. Then, she reached for the little black and white patterned bone that hangs down. We were so excited, and she's had it attached to the bar on her carseat ever since. The real test, however, was our 10-hour drive from Louisiana to Kentucky for the Thanksgiving holidays. But Pupsqueak came through for us with flying colors: anytime she would get fussy, I could reach back and shake him a bit so he would jingle softly, and she would be happy again. After my arm would get tired, I'd make sure he was adjusted where she could get at him, and she would, at not yet 4 months, bat at it herself.Pupsqueak is a wonderful toy with a soft, gently jingle for young babies and a funny bark that even makes my four-year-old laugh for older babies. He is definitely top dog in my book
We heat our home with a coal stove, so when it comes time to put the baby down I worry that the room might become too cold.  With this monitor I can keep an ear on the baby at the same time as keeping an eye on the temperature and humidity level in her room.  The humidity level comes in handy during cold season, I've found.  The night light on this monitor is great, it's very adjustable or you can shut it off altogether.  I've not owned it very long, so I can't comment on durability yet, but so far so good.  My [..] has dropped the parent receiver once or twice and it's still fine.  I would definitely recommend this monitor, thank God the price was right too
My son has been wearing the halo sleep sack since the day he came home from the hospital.  Being a winter baby it was the best thing in the world to know that he would be warm and not have to worry about loose blankets.  He began sleeping through the night at 7 weeks old.  I think the sleep sack gives him a feeling of security.  He was never able to sleep without being in it.  He is now 30 months old and still won't go to sleep unless he is in his sleep sack.  We had to have a friend of ours who is a seamstress add additional material to the bottom because he became to tall for it.  That is how much he loves his sleep sack.  It is by far the best thing I ever bought for my son
I was given these wall hangings as a present.  I love them and they make the room look great.  We also were presented with the problem of how to hang them.  There is what seems to be a dowel pocket in the back, but that seemed too complicated to deal with.  Therefore, my husband and I attached a safty pin to the back of each square in the center at the top.  My husband then used a finish nail in the wall, and used the safty pin to hang over the nail.  The pin is low enough so you do not see it or the nail the square is hanging on. It was easy to do, and the wall hangings look great!  I thought there would be a problem with getting them to be straight, but they are light enough to manipulate and stay where they are placed. I hope this helps others with this problem.  I still wonder though, why on earth the company didn't foresee this problem in the first place
If you are flying alone with a small child, you should not go without this.  It's a tight fit, but it works
have used these bibs for two kids now, wow do they last, and unlike some bibs, these can go right in the washer and dryer - well worth the money!  Still using them for my messy 3 year old
If you have an ipod or mp3 player, I'd recommend getting this.  I think the baby is going to love it!  I bought it last week, and tested it out (our baby hasn't been born yet).  The speakers are plenty loud enough for a baby's crib or room IMO, and I'm 1/2 deaf.  I also like the little nightlight on it that changes color.  My only criticism is that it takes batteries (no AC adapter).  We may invest in a rechargeable set of batteries if it uses batteries up quickly.  For $20, I think it's great
This a wonderful stroller.  I have a large 35lb, 2yr old and he is very comfortable.  Great folding mechanism. Folding is easy and I can do it with one hand. Nice pockets for storage
After reading the reviews and reluctantly we bought the stroller.  I am glad we didn't listen to those naysayers.  It was the best decision we made because the stroller is wonderful.  The comments people wrote about how the stroller is awkward and heavy is a bunch of rubbish.  Yes, the stroller is heavier than its predecessors but they fail to mention how sturdy it is.  We've had the stroller for 2 weeks and we hike up some hilly mountains (Stanford Dish if you are from Palo Alto) and it rides smoothly.  It gives me comfort that the stroller is well built and protecting our two daughters (2 year old and 4 weeks old enfant).  I feel secure that the stroller will not fall apart after a few rides like its predecessor.  Also, we love the capabilities, spring shocks for a smooth ride, shorter so we can navigate through some tight corners and it is not awkwardly long like the other double strollers.  We have a Toyota Sienna and it fits just fine in our back trunk.As for the weight.  Yes, it is heavier but come on, it is not "10" times heavier.  People exaggerate too much.  If you are accustom to carrying your 30 pound toddler in your arms, then the stroller is nothing.  People are too much of a wimp.  It is slightly heavier than its predecessors but not by much.  They made it heavier because the load baring bar is what keeps the stroller steady and sturdy.  Gives me peace of mind that my precious asset in life (my two daughters) are protected. The only recommendation is that the back two wheels could squeak which can be annoying.  Just use Silicone spray and they all went away.  We've been through rain, dirt, and hot sun with this stroller and we've been so happy with it.  I highly recommend purchasing it.  but make sure you have a truck, mini-van, or SUV.  I am not sure if a standard vehicle can house such a stroller.  But I figured if you have two toddler/enfants, you may consider getting a bigger car
Overall, we are very happy with this product. I like that it covers the entire side of the crib and doesn't come up only partway like a traditional bumper. Also, I like the breathable netting since baby can see out through it and since it "gives" a bit when baby pushes and kicks it. We have a nonstandard length crib (Babee Tenda), so we do have small gaps at each end of the rail, but we had read about this issue in another review from a Babee Tenda crib owner, so we knew up front we would have these gaps. These small gaps have not been a problem for us as our baby doesn't seem to want to stick her legs through the gaps in this location (I think it's difficult since she would have to lie almost flush with the headboard or footboard to do so). The white satin edge is very pleasant to look at. Overall I like this product much more than the traditional bumpers I have seen.
I love it!  This is probably one of my most used baby items.  It is so handy to use while we are out and so easy to clean.  I've bought this as a shower gift for several of my pregnant friends
We really like our Graco digital iMonitor. It gives very clear sound in a good range of volumes, and has a much longer range than any analog monitors that we tried previously. We do not get quite the range that is claimed on the box--usually it reaches about 1/2 a city block, depending on the strength of charge left in the rechargeable batteries. The lights that light up for baby's sound are quite bright, which can be a problem if you like to sleep in complete darkness. I turn the monitor around so that the lights do not keep me awake
I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about--the product installs on the bowl and secures the lid and toilet seat.  It's easy to install and works great
We purchased this gate to span an opening near the bottom of our stairs and it works very well. We have had this gate in place since my son started crawling and he has yet to breech the perimeter. My husband installed it easily (one end into a stud in the wall, one end into an oak stair banister) and it is sturdy - even with my son frequently shaking it in the middle, it has shown no signs of dislodging. I give it 4 stars out of 5 because it is not very attractive and the opening mechanism is somewhat cumbersome (and tough for guests to figure out). But it definitely does its job and I would recommend this gate to anyone with a long span to cover
Unfortunately - the baby I bought this for already had one! But I got to see it in action, and listen to the parents rave about it! It is really neat - almsot to the point I wish I had kept it for myself!!
I was really nervous about this product after reading the reviews, but once I put the organizer up it was great. I use the top four slots for thing like mittens and cotton balls and the next two for wipes and larger lotion and bath items. The bottom is really good for several diapers. I love it!!!
Lightweight, high-quality construction. We are very pleased with it, and our 1.5yr girl just loves it.  The carrying strap is a very convenient addition. Don't waste your money on a $20 umbrella stroller, spend a little more and enjoy the high quality of this excellent stroller
It works great for me. I have 2 floor + 2 kids + 2 cats and before I didn't know what going on in my house. Now I can hear any sound - guests coming, kids playing/watching TV and even when cats jump on dining table to steel some food.It makes some fone sound on max volume, but I don't care - I just reduse volume or change unit position. I strongly recomend this Monitor
We've had this toy for around 3 years now.  My second child loves playing with it as much as my firstborn!  It is also a hit with other children visiting our house.  The toy is as educational as it is fun!  We've used it to practice colors, shapes, and musical creativity.  It can get a little pricey as the cartridges to expand the set run ~$20 new.  All in all a FANTASTIC toy well worth the price!  Another upside is how friendly and helpful the Neurosmith company is.  We lost a block and they were friendly and helpful with the replacement.My friend finally broke down and bought this for her 2 kids because they also loved it so much
I bought this sheet for my Graco Pack n' Play and it fits great.  It's very soft and looks great wash after wash.
My boys love them. They draw in the car and their cup can sit on it. Kinda a pain for short drives, but wonderful for longer trips.
The fastest way to KNOW your plastic baby wares are CLEAN!  I love these bags.  Note, I use two bags simultaneously in the microwave to knock out my cleaning faster, since there are limits to how many items you can put in each bag without warping.You do need to get any smudgy or residue like material off the plastic item BEFORE steaming it for best results.Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this product, it has been a lifesaver to me
My newborn loves this seat. The calming music and the vibation helps calm her when she is being fussy! Easy to put together and take down if you want to take it with you. Great Product!
Absolutely love it, and it's a GREAT quality too.For this price???? I just can't believe it!!
I bought these bottles because my daughter was having trouble with the flow of other bottles.They were to fast for her .Like  the other reviews this was also the only paci she would take that didn't gag her. Great for little babies that can't control their flow control
I cringe at the idea that I fed my baby from heated up polycarbonate bottles. I might not be able to breastfeed my baby, but with my new glass bottles, at least I know that I am feeding her the purest form of formula I can possibly give. She hated the taste of the latex rubber nipples so I bought some silicone ones and was successful.When I consider the epidemic of autism in this country, I am dedicated to buying pure, organic baby products and avoiding using plastic products especially when heating in the microwave. 
This is a very useful item. It looks great and holds a lot of stuff. You can also carry it around from room to room
Great, safe and nice looking bumper!  I would recommend it without hesitation
My wife and I like the portable crib quite a bit.  It is great to move from room to room and you can pull it up next to your bed similar to a co-sleeper.  The price is also not bad at all.  The only annoying thing is that the mattress pad that comes with it is so flimsy as to be practically unusable.  (We went to Baby Depot and bought a serviceable pad for about $20.)  Even after buying the extra mattress pad I still think the portable crib was a good buy and I do not regret our decision to buy the crib at all.  (I would buy the crib again if I had to start all over--our son sleeps quite well in it.
I love this car seat except for the fact that the one I have is defective.  The crotch snap does not work properly.  When I contacted Baby Trend, they advised that they do not exchange or repair their products free, even though mine was manufactured in October 2006 & I contacted them in December - less than a month after I bought it.Otherwise, this is a wonderful seat.  I love the triangular handle.  I use it with the Snap & Go and have no trouble at all transferring her.  If she falls asleep in it, it is easy to take her wherever I want without disturbing her.  She seems very comfortable in it as well.  She was born November 12, 2006.The hood is such that it can block out the sun, no matter from which direction it is shining.  And you can still see her face - if you are tall enough.The product is great - if yours if fully functioning.  I'm anxious for her to grow to 20 pounds so I can buy another seat.  As it is, I try not to take her in the car any more than I have to because of the defective lock since I can't spring for another seat now.  I will never buy another Baby Trend for that reason
This is a great walker. The tray has plenty of activities to keep the little one busy and the music steering wheel and button lights can easily be removed to make the tray even bigger. My grandson just loves the walker and I do too because it gives him the freedom to move from place to place safely. Amazon sells model #14570, so don't worry, the walker is sturdy with locking wheels for when you prefer him to stay stationary. Also, a plus is that it converts into a walk behind walker which assists the child learning to walk
we have the one with brown trim, but i had to write a review here too because we just LOVE this blanket.  it's super soft, the perfect size for swaddling, and nice and light AND still warm for baby.  we live in hawaii so we love how this blanket keeps the drafts off our son, but doesn't cause him to wake up sweaty.  it costs a little more than your average cotton blanket but it's COMPLETELY worth the money! i'd buy another in a second
I ordered this stroller to take my 16 month old daughter to Florida on vacation...It is absolutely perfect...folds small, has room for storage, you can even carry a small diaper bag under the seat on the cross bars...it really is perfect for travel...actually, it is perfect for anytime.
Out of all the department stores here, I got a recommendation to choose the titan over the triumph, for the easness. It got noted as lighter and easier to deal with. I secound the so far so good comment earlier.. Its comfortable than most seats I have shopped for besides the #1 Britax that I have yet to experience:)
This is a wonderful stroller.  I'm so glad I took a chance and ordered it, sight unseen.I ordered the red version, which is much snazzier in person than on the Amazon picture.It is fairly lightweight - much lighter than our Graco model, but heavier than those cheap little umbrella strollers, nice and sturdy.  But it folds up in an umbrella fashion, so it won't take up too much room in your trunk and could be carried, if necessary.It comes with neat things like a rain cover, sun shade, and cold weather boot.  The rain and shade covers are neatly contained in an attachable pouch and the boot fits easily in the stroller's basket.The canopy has a window, provides lots of shade, and is even partially removable to let the breeze run through on a balmy day.  Coolest of all, it has a built in mesh pouch that doesn't take up any room but still manages to hold everything I need: sunscreen, hand sanitizer, wallet, keys, cell phone, and sunglasses.  It's stretchy mesh, so if you don't have anything it just lies flat against the hood.  But it does have a plastic lining, so it's waterproof!  Also, it zips, so your things can't fall out and aren't accessible to your two year old, either.The basket is large enough for a medium sized diaper bag, although a small bag would fit best, especially if you want to keep the boot in there.The best part is that everything is snazzy.  Everything looks nice, the materials feel great, and it's well designed.  The parts that should be removable/washable are.It's a snap to put together (took just a couple of minutes) and everything locks into place in a smart way.  It's very easy to fold and unfold.  Also, it reclines beautifully and easily, including into a totally upright position.  I became frustrated that my Graco model's most upright position was still too reclined for our one year old.    The place where your child's legs hang down is neat.  It is adjustable, so it could stick straight out, hang down, or even flip up for a very little one (maybe to use with the boot?)...  Your kid won't get a weird stroller mark on the underside of their little knees.It has the newer style which I notice most new strollers seem to have where you only have to clip two things in to buckle a baby in.  My Graco model (purchased last year) is such a complicated mess.  You attach two things together on one side, two things together on the other side, then connect each side into the center.  Arg!  My son almost always fussed by the time I'd finished.  Also, he was always sitting on one of the straps, which easily became twisted.  My husband STILL has not figured out how to do this quickly.  :)  So this is a big improvement.It's also comfy!  I can't vouch for that myself, of course.  But my son settles down into it and looks perfectly comfortable.  With the Graco model, he ended up with his legs flung over one side of the tray and if he wasn't tightly belted in he slouched down a lot.A few minor imperfections about the Zooper Twist.  The cupholder is a mesh bag attached to the handle.  It works well for a standard water bottle or something, but one of those giant mall-sized beverages might not be so great.  You can easily remedy this by investing in a good quality cup attachment, if that is important to you.This stroller is great for me - I'm 5'5.  It would be nice if the stroller handles were adjustable.This isn't a jogging stroller.  It does offer a nice feature where you can lock the front two wheels so they do not swivel, which makes going over rough surfaces safer and easier to manage.This isn't the kind of stroller that is going to hold everything but the kitchen sink, if you are looking for that kind of stroller.  There isn't a cup and snack tray for your child.  No clock.This is just the greatest stroller and I'm so glad to dump our awful Graco stroller.  Hated. that. thing.  This is snazzy, well designed, handy, lightweight, convenient, and offers everything we need
My son has colic and this blanket is a lifesaver! When I wrap him in it, he falls asleep and stays asleep for long periods of time. He can easily break out of the Swaddle Me, but not the Miracle Blanket. I am going ot buy this product for all of my pregnant friends!!
I have a climber!  She could climb out of her crib at age 13 months.  She was way too young for a bed.  We also have the crib tent II and both items have allowed us to feel our now 22 month old daughter is safely in her crib at night--not roaming her room or house while we sleep.  It was either these products or emptying all the furniture out of her room, putting a mattress on the floor, and putting a lock on her door at night to keep her safe.  Life saver
I have tried just about every diaper rash cream (desitin, balmex, mustela, vaseline, sprays, gold bond powder, generic brands, etc...), but this is the only brand that truly works.  The oatmeal or whatever secret ingredient it has gets rid of the redness on my daughter's bum in usually one or two changes.  BEST PRODUCT
We tried three other brands and types of gates on the market. Two were plastic and the third was a metal gate ordered from one of the pet catalogs costing $66! The two plastic gates each broke within days of being installed and the other metal gate was stiff and hard to use and took over an hour to actually install. This Evenflo Gate was put together, installed and in full use within 30 minutes of arriving and the dogs haven't been able to budge it one inch. Plus it looks good and blends with the taupe ricepaper on the walls. Great product at a bargain price - we're ordering three more
This is absolutely the greatest shampoo ever! I've been abusing my hair for at least 30 years, and I have never had my hair looking and feeling as healthy as it does now. There is no better product for your hair on the market. All others are full of damaging detergents and chemicals with a dose of silicone thrown in to make you think your hair is clean, but you're killing it. I admire Jonathan for not treating us like idiots by being THE ONLY shampoo that doesn't tell you to lather, shampoo, and rinse twice, but you do need to. And you need to use no more than a dime-size amount of the Jonathan conditioner. My hair has never looked or felt so good
I had the Chi Turbo (1"), but I got worried after reading some reviews about it being unreliable.  So part of the reason I wanted to buy the T3 iron was that it comes with a 4-YEAR comprehensive warranty.  The other difference is that the solid-ceramic plates are "infused" with tourmaline which I found intriguing.1-3/8" wide plates are the perfect width for my long-ish hair.  (I've used a 2 inch wide iron, which I found harder to maneuver.)  It heats up fast, and stays hot.  It does a great job gripping the hair without snagging.  My hair stays silky and straight all day, and does not feel damaged after a while, like it did with cheaper irons I've used in the past.Another thing that this iron does that other irons do not do as well - it really curls.  It has heat vents along the sides of the plates that lets you curl your hair by twisting it near the root and pulling it through (different from the usual method of gripping the ends of the strands and then winding up).  It creates a springy curl better than any flat iron I've used.  (However, the heating vents make the exterior of the iron hotter to the touch.  So there is a drawback to this function.)Overall, I enjoy using this flat iron.  Very happy with this purchase.ETA: I've learned that HairArt will not honor the warranty unless you buy it from an authorized distributor (e.g., Sephora). So you might want to check that before you place your order
I purchased a Beauty Water Shower Purification System and have used it about 5 times now with fantastic results. I have very hard water in my home and am tired of constantly having to blow dry my hair or having to use tons of products for it to be manageable and not frizzy.  My hair felt very soft and manageable using this product and I am hoping it helps my highlights last longer.  I did not experience that 'slimy' feeling people usually associate with soft water.  I'm even able to let my hair air dry and not be frizzy with this product.  I am curious to see how long this filter lasts.  I called Jonathan Products and was told that they do have a replacement filter that costs $55 so you can save a bit of money when you need to replace the filter
I just got this item (from ebay, it's cheaper)and feel it's worthy of praise.  I have thick, straight hair, and bought this product to wave my hair.  I haven't figured out how it curls, but to wave it's incredibly easy!  Grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w/o burning your hair like a curling iron would.  Also w/ a curling iron, it's difficult to wave the top close to the roots.   It heats fast!  and comes w/ a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools. 
This stuff is great.  I used to buy new gels, pommades, pastes, etc. every month because I could never find one that worked exactly how I wanted it to.  But I first tried this a year ago and it's all I've used since.  And it lasts a long time, so don't be afraid of the price.  One container lasts me about 6 months, so you only have to buy it twice a year.  I'll be ordering my third order of it soon
Its effect very much depends on the climate you live in. If you live in a colder and dry climate, especially during winter it does exactly as it promises - great moisturizer, lines are diminished, as is puffiness. I really love using it - I am 35 and currently living in a cold and dry climate. But in hot and sometims humid climates, or during summer it just doesn't work as well - I don't know why. I like it a lot and this is my 3rd bottle, although I am using it as a seasonal eye care
i've gotten a few compliments on it...by my advice to the ladies who want to buy perfume via online...buy the smaller bottles first to see if you really like the scent...moreso than the big bottles.  i bought the $50 one and i do like it, but i think it's gonna take me awhile to finish it...so from now on, i'll buy the 1.7 oz. first and then buy the bigger bottles if i like the scent.  but overall, very fresh and sweet smelling..
This lip gloss smells good, goes on slick and stays on a long time. Great value for the price. I love Philosophy products. They're all great
       Laura Mercier cosmetics are a bit like bon-bons - you can't have just one.  She makes it easy for us with her Eye Color Duos - 2 compatible eye shadow colors in one mirrored compact.	While there are five appealing color combinations, all fresh and sheer, my current favorites are Moss and Azure.  With two colors, one light and one dark, I have a veritable palette of possibilities.  Each can be used alone or together with one shading under the brow and the other on the lid.  Or, the colors can be mixed for a completely different effect.	Colors are intensified by a second or third application.  (A sponge tipped swab is very effective for this.)	Merci, Mercier!       
this is a great product, however i would like to know if its organic.a very good value too
I have tried many face cleaners, Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser and it is great. Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser has a nice scent and leaves my face feeling tingly clean without dry it out. Murad Acne Clarifying Cleanser helps control my acne and I would recommend Murad to anyone who needs help with acne.
This stuff is wonderful!  I still use a moisturizer w/ SPF 15, but why settle for SPF 15 when you can get SPF 40?  This is not a creamy sunscreen that makes your skin feel all oily and like it can't breathe, instead it's more on the liquid side and you just quickly rub it in, then you can go ahead and put your regular moisturizer and makeup over it.  It's lovely and light and you can wear it every day.  It's the only sunscreen I have found that has enough SPF coverage for my sensitive pale skin but isn't thick enough to clog up my pores and cause breakouts. It may seem expensive, but not only is the quality of the product worth it, but you only need a small amount.  I wear it during the spring and the summer, and after a year I'm still working on the same bottle.  I wasn't sure if it was going to be effective (not being from a brand that you usually associate with rugged outdoor activity), but after a week by the beach, I was the only one who's face wasn't burned all red, even though everyone else had been wearing Coppertone and Bullfrog facial sunscreen
I have only used clinique eye shadows and have been so happy with them. I've tried different brands and always come back to this one. They have great colors and it lasts all day without creasing or looking too "powdery".
Since I was in high school, so many women have praised the wonders of Almost Lipstick in Black Honey.  I finally self-gifted and purchased for myself, and all of my expectations have been met.  The color is initially scary in the tube, but at the very least swipe it on your hand - you'll see that it is actually a very wearable sheer brownish raspberry color.  You can layer it for a stronger color, or swipe it over lip balm to make it even more sheer.  The resulting effect is your lips, but better.  The color of your lips is improved and they are moist and shiny looking.  If you layer repeatedly over dry lips it is a very shiny deep red brown color.  I've seen Black Honey worn by fair/medium Asian and White women and has looked flattering on every one of them.  Lastly, the product does not smell.  It has no perfumes that become disgusting as the day wears on, nor does it have that cheap waxy smell/taste.  A fabulous product
This stuff goes on easy, stays well (but WILL rub off with water, won't withstand a good cry).  Nice.  Not quite as nice as the Victoria's Secret liner (I swear by that stuff, discontinued 3-4 years ago), but WAY better than anything cheaper.  I have TRIED other things.  Plus, won't irritate my very sensitive eyes
For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky. The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. Enjoy! Gail Cook
This product actually works as described, it helped significantly improve the appearance of a scar created by a chemical burn within 2 weeks. The scar is still visible but has lightened a number of shades and feels smoother. I highly recommend this produc
I really like this product.  I would not, however, agree with the person who said that it is entirely too strong a scent.  I would actually like it to be stronger, and have less peel and more juice smell.  But it is a nice scent, and cleans very thoroughly.  Not the best I've used, but very nice
This perfume is my absolute favorite!!! It smells so good. I love it! And this roll on is so easy. You can just pack it  in your purse and use it whenever. Its so convenient! But you won't have to really put it on several times day. Once is enough. The scent carries on all day long! I highly recommend this fragrance as a gift to anyone
I am no ladies man, but the ladies love the givenchy sent.  it is a young hip classic cologne ala DCG, Issey Miyake, etc
Sephora Roll-up blotting paper is so handy. Whenever you have to freshen up, this is great to use before you powder your face. All you do is rip off the right about of paper you want and blot your face. They feel weightless and matte skin. Just imagine all the oil that gets trapped into a powder puff. gosh. disgusting! Best of all, you get so much paper, the roll is never-ending! It's so tiny and compact, you would even want to share them with your friends
This is a really nice little bomb, and smells of those little candy conversation hearts that come out for Valentine's day each year. Sort of tangy and light and sweet. But as with all that Lush does, there is a depth to this scent that makes it interesting enough to enjoy bathing in time and time again.The tonka oil in it is good for helping you to forgive yourself and for relaxation, according to the first Lush Times catalog it appeared in, so whenever I am having a bad day or kicking myself for making a silly mistake, I bathe in this and feel better. It also has lavender for relaxation and neroli to uplift the spirits.The only downside to this bomb is that the scent doesn't linger much at all once you get out of the bath, which is disappointing to me since it smells so good! Still, it is a worthy bath bomb and the cheery pink water and uplifting scent make it one I come back to time and time again
       Glamorous, mysterious, seductive all describe Armani Code, a captivating orange blossom based scent from Giorgio Armani Fragrance.	As one would expect from this master couturier the bottle itself is a gem.  Tapering from a weighted base the slim flacon seems to glow as lacquered shades of blue sweep from an early dawn at the bottom of the sleek holder to midnight nearing the top.  Adding to the fragrance's intrigue is an oriental effect achieved by  lace embroidery on the glass.	The scent  is sweet yet sensuous with a sparkle provided by orange zest.  With orange blossom at its heart Armani Code is enhanced by Sambac jasmine, Madagascan vanilla and honey.  The man in my life called it "delicious," and I do, too.  It's now high on my list of favorite fragrances.        - Gail Cook
Almost immediately after using this face mask the redness in my face was gone.  It helps with a number or skin problems, and I have sensitive skin so it's hard to find a product that won't hurt me.  Most facial masks cause a minor chemical burn, this left my face beautifully soft.  If you're unsure of this product, or wavering at all, let me tell you that you should buy it, it's amazing.
I love this smell- its sweet yet warm- not too sweet though, just right.  Very inviting, and you can wear with anything anywhere.  ALOT of compliments! with this one.... Will buy again! and again
I LOVE this stuff. I ordered it at a friends Body Shop party a while back. I use it each moring after I shower and it keeps my lips soft all day! I tried to find something like this in the stores but NOTHING even came close to being as good as this!!! I highly reccomend it
I found it to have a little too much 'yellow' for my brows, (I have blonde/grey hair, but it performs well, and I like the slim point.  I just mix in a little of my charcoal to soften the yellow
Love this for hot summer days, dry winter days and hot flashes :) A must have for catching the vapors also good when out in the sun..
I am a hair fanatic... test and try everything.  This comb is the best comb I've come across for my hair.  I have a lot of thick hair, so this comb really does the job.  I have been using Avon combs for over 5 years now and love them.  Very strong and don't break easily.  Because my hair is thick, I still need to use conditioner to help detangle it, other wise my hair would be ruined.  Worth every penny, and for $4.99, you can't lose. 
I absolutely love the smell of Philosophy's Cinnamon Buns.  Like the other reviewers have said, it doesn't last long after the shower but it is a nice way to wake up in the morning.  Even my husband likes it and he is really picky about anything scented.I only use it as a shower gel and not a shampoo so it lasts pretty long making it worth the expense.  I like the other Cinnamon Buns products also - I use the cream and the lip gloss
This Pur Minerals Starter Kit is a great introduction to this brand.  I am absolutely in love with the 4-in-1 Pressed Mineral Makeup (included in the kit). It's so much better than the Bare Escentuals makeup, which I had been using for years. The 4-in-1 provides great coverage, as it is a foundation, concealer, and spf 15 pressed powder all in one. With Bare Escentuals, I was having to buy the mineral veil, foundation and concealer all separately, and I still felt like my dark circles and blemishes were not covered well. Pur Minerals is a wonderful makeup, very lightweight, and even the brush is soft on my skin! I highly recommend it
For a long time I avoided anything with gardenia like a plague-it always smelled too sickly sweet to me. This perfume changed my mind completely-yes, there is gsrdenia but its very light and fresh and unlike any gardenia you've ever smelled. Try it for yourself
After suffering from a terrible cold all week I finally succumbed to a hot bath. I had to rummage through my box filled with Lush products ( gift from a thoughtful boyfriend) when I pulled out this huge disc and broke out half while saving the other for one more bath. I didn't even know what this was called but the minute it touched the water, refreshing and invigorating essences of lemons and milky cream escaped my nose, I felt happy in an instant, it was amazing! Even thought my nose refused to recognize scent for days I smelled the oils and citrusy botanicals, the bath water filled with tiny bubbles and I soaked my cold and stress away. After the bath I felt great, my skin and bones felt refreshed and I was warm, cozy and felt a lot better. After looking it up online I was really surprised to see that this was called The Happy Pill, because it really did make me happy. I am really looking forward to using the other half, hopefully when I'm not sick anymore. Once again Lush came through for me with the products they so lovingly create and I cannot recommend their bath bombs enough. Whether taken as a fun bath product or to relieve cold or sadness they always work in gentle and relaxing ways.The main ingredients in this little love ball are good skin nourishers such as Olive oil, Hemp oil, Grapefruit oil, Bergamot oil, Frankincense oil, Lemon oil, Grange Flower Absolute, Mandarin oil, Gardenia Extract ( yum!) and sodium bicarbonate.Happy Bathing!- Kasia S.
This stuff smells awesome.  I have it on my bathroom sink and it makes my whole bathroom smell like candy.  I haven't used it yet because I love the smell so much and I don't want it to go away.  I just ordered a bunch though, so I will try it out.  They are really pretty too.  If I was a kid and didn't know any better I would probably try to eat it
The best thing about this product is that there is a numbing agent.  Apply and leave on the skin for about 20-30 seconds and then your skin begins to numb slightly, then you start shaving.  It's great because you don't feel the razor on the skin as much; which makes shaving quite pleasant. I've searched for other shaving cream on the market with this numbing feature and the closest is Anthony Logistics which I don't think as nice as Philosophy Common Man.A little goes a long way when you shave and so the tube lasts quite long. I would buy this again...
This fragrance starts off fine, but the longer you wear the better it gets, and that very nice smell lasts a wonderfully long time!!
The pores of the face become clogged with makeup, cremes, sunscreens, Bronzing Gels, Powders, etc.  Exfoliation, washing, facials, steaming DO NOT REMOVE BLACKHEADS, WHITEHEADS AND CLOGGED PORES.  This simple product gets them out!  Buying one will last a life time.  No need to buy another ever....The Ultimate cleaning device....
I have been using this powder for about 5 years. It is amazing. I have problems with red cheeks and breakouts. Once I put on my concealer and foundation, I put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear. It even comes with the perfect application brush. This powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do
If you have dry skin on your feet these socks are fantastic.  I place mine in the microwave for 15 seconds while I apply moisturizer to my feet.  Slide the socks onto your feet as soon as the microwave is finished.  In 15 minutes you have a quick, but effective moisturizing treatment.  If your feet are really dry you could do the same thing but leave them on overnight.  I found the overnight option to be a little warm on my feet.  But, it might work fine for you.These socks are 94% cotton and 6% Spandex.  They can be machine washed and tumbled dried.  I have not found it necessary launder them each time I use them.  I use a light moisturizer (Kerasal), so you might have a different experience if you use a heavier product to moisturize.I would highly recommend this product.
I recieved a sample of this bar with a large shipment of Lush products I ordered around Christmas, I gave most of the products as gifts so I full enjoyed the Samples no matter how freaky they sounded I loved this bar it smelled clean and was fun to use and even though I have combination skin that usually is dry that time of year, I did not notice any drying out and it cleared all problem areas up especially black heads! I strongly recomend this bar for any one with any problem areas. I wish I could talk more of my friends into using Lush products because their simply is the perfect miracle product for everyone to be found among them. And how fabulous are those bath products simply heaven
...every home should have some! There is no greater soap for beautiful scent, gentle cleansing and a unique ability to comfort and pamper. A perfect gift and a must in posh, top notch hotels etc. Some scents are universal while others distinctly feminine, either way they are worth a try and well worth the buy
I recently realized that while my wife spends hundreds on high quality skin care products for us, I was still using throw away razors.  I recently received a Fusion razor and loved that, until I went to replace the blades.  $4+ a piece, and they last no longer than any other blade.  So, I got online and researched shaving and what I learned was that, though there have been advances in shaving technology, nothing has been improved, only made more expensive.  I learned my dad was right; all it takes for a great shave is a good safety razor, a decent brush, shaving soap and a mug.I received my razor a couple of days ago and now, I wake up eager to take a shower and shave.  Nothing has ever cut this close without giving me razor burn.  My skin is sensitive and I have had no problems with that since getting this amazing razor.  It was worth the price, too, because it is the same cost as 4 sets of Fusion replacements.  The replacement blades for this razor are fifty cents a piece and do a far better job.  I have read reviews for this razor by people who, apparently, weren't trained to shave.  This razor will not cut against the grain.  Also, the handle is weighted, so you have to allow the razor to do all the work, or you run the real risk of filleting your face.  Be patient.  A great shave takes a little more commitment than just breaking out a can of foam and a disposable razor.  Let the razor do the work.  I assure you, even if it takes a few days to get the technique down, you will be thrilled with this razor.The nicest feature of this amazing razor is that it allows you to adjust the closeness of the blade. I learned that most people like it between one and one and a half.  Mine is set at one and a half and it gives me a perfect shave every time. Until now, I didn't know that such a thing was even possible.  Happy shaving
This shaving brush is perhaps the most inexpensive way to get a pure Badger bristle shaving brush. I've now been using it for a year and a half, and it has not shed any real amount of its bristles like the cheaper brushes on the market. The brush head remains densely packed and quite soft. Hopefully, it will remain that way for some time to come. In the meantime, I do enjoy the close and comfortable shaves that are aided by this brush. Because of it, I have sworn off of canned shave gels for every situation except travel. They just can't compare to your average $1.50 cake of shaving soap and this brush. This was a very worthwhile purchase for me
I REALLY like using this product. The color powder is very sheer and the shimmer powder adds just a subtle amount of sparkle. I like using this after I have applied a light amount of foundation in place of a powder which normally makes my face look older. The shimmer powder doesn't cake like ordinary powders do and gives my face a fresh look.
Mally's Shimmmer, Shape & Glow is the best!!! I love the colors and she gives you an instructional guide that aids you on how to apply the shimmer shape and finally the glow.  This girl knows what it takes to help you look like JLo or Beyonce' on the street.  I cannot count how many times people have stopped and said how much they liked my makeup and I give all credit to Mally Roncal for her inspiration to help women feel "girly".  Try the product you will like it
I just bought Retread Hair Conditioner today from my local LUSH store and tried it tonight.  My hair was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G after I used it.  After I've read all the reviews about the product, I was still a little skepticle, as I've tried many things that had awesome reviews, but just didn't work with my thick coarse hair.  I shampooed my hair, put in Retread Hair Conditioner, covered my hair with a plastic cap and set a hot towel over it for an hour (dunking the towel in hot water every 15 minutes to 'reheat' it).  Rinsed out the conditioner and didn't use anything else on my hair (I usually have to put in anti-frizz serum).  The first thing I noticed was the shine... what a HUGE difference.  Even my boyfriend said there was something different, but he couldn't quite figure it out.  Retread Hair Conditioner left my hair super soft too.  And you don't even need to use that much.Now for the bad....the smell (that's why it's not 5 stars)!  I know some people say they love it and some people say they hate it, and I really think that's the way it is... you either hate it or love it.  I actully hated it.  My boyfriend took one whiff (and thought it smelled like old soggy towels) and offered to drive me back to LUSH to return it because he thought it was 'old'.  Another reviewer said it smelled like 'barnyard' and I think that's the best way to describe it.  You do get used to it (and luckly the smell fades as your hair dries), but for me, the smell was too much.  I will buy again because I absolutely love the results, but I will only use Retread Hair Conditioner when I know I will be home the next day to spare others from the smell
heads up lightening fast..very cute purple*..works great i wonder if they make these smaller as well..ill be looking i love this thing : 
I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!  It smells wonderful, is rich and thick and always wakes me up in my morning shower. I have tried quite a few of the Philosophy 3 in one products - and this is one of my favorites
I absolutely love this fragrance.  I like and use a lot of Philosophy products.  The only problem I have is that it doesn't last long.  When I do put it on I get a lot of compliments when it's fresh
I LOVE everything about these sops!!!  They are luxurious and delicious at the same time......one thing I need to indulge in.The scents last for days after you've used them.....my bathroom still smells like a mix of verbena and honey-almond!!!! Just scrumptious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not to mention how your skin smells and feels afterwards!These are amazing soaps that EVERYONE should use.  I feel exquisite using them and the gift sets are a fabulous thing to give to friends or even aquaintences.  They are sure to think of how thoughtful you were to give it to them everytime they use this wonderful soap!!!!!! 
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  This powder/foundation has THE best coverage out there!  I don't like to wear liqued foundation because it makes my skin feel real oily.  This powder foundation is better than any out there
This product is great! I had always been a non believer but in the eight month with my second pregnancy when I could not take the strecth marks, the itching the pain the red skin, I used it and it was like magic. Three days of use and I am a new person with soooo much better skin, getting better everyday
I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate by the end of the as other products have.  Also my coloring is very fair, red hair and blue eyes, even with brown/black mascara I always looked a little off-matched.  The brown in this line is a beautiful color and looks more natural than any I have ever used.  The ease of removal is the icing on the cake
I'm giving this product 4 stars for how well this pencil blends with any brow color....I would think for people who use and like to define brows with pencil, this is a perfect neutral color.I subtracted one star because iprefer to apply brow definers with brow powder and a brush. I think it looks more natural..  Brenda Christian makes a brow powder which I prefer over pencils but the color of this pencil is far superior to any powderI can find.  Sometimes I mix the two. I start with the pencil and add a bit of powder.  All all, it's the color of this pencil that is superior to all other eyebrow pencils
I don't know how many mascaras I own but there's always about two or three that I hold as my favorite or just for different occasions. One of those is Hypnose and I really like it for when I go out or just looking for that dramatic look.Postive:1.) The look: I've never neccessarily wanted to wear fake eyelashes but they do look almost perfect. Unbelievably, Hypnose gives you that look. It's amazing just how feathery your eyelashes look.2.) Flaking: This mascara never really flaked on the bottom of my eyes. That's really important to me.Negative:1.) This mascara starts out great but after about two and a half weeks it starts emptying out on you. This might just be because there were days when I reapplyed it or simply because I just used it pretty well (1 coat just about everyday because of how much I liked it).Summary: If you want that natural yet "are those real lashes?!" look, then you'll like this mascara. I'm giving it four stars instead of five simply because of how long it lasts but if you use it once it a while, then it will last you a while
I'm REALLY anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla, but MAC LipGlass isn't that vanilla-ish at all!  It's got very pigmented color, it stays on a LONG time for a gloss, and each tube lasts a long time...  Don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off
If you love the scent of the Bathina line, Benefit has finally come out with an eau de toilette with the same scent. I wear this scent everyday and I always get compliments. I love to put the scent in my hair because it lingers in hair longer than skin. Many scents smell different on different skin types, but Maybe Baby is a pretty true scent. I guaruntee you will absolutely love this perfume and so will everyone around you. :
"Body so fine" is the most beautiful and luxurious cosmetic I ever had. I recommend it because the description of benefit is absolutely real. It's the most delicious, velvet and beautiful balm for the legs and the arms. Also the retro - chic and vintage box and can are romantic and beautiful. PERFECT for me
I loved this product.  The Stencils are easy to use and the instructions are easy to follow.  The Browns are a bit dark so if you have red in your hair like I do you might want to start out light you can always go darker if you need to
I just started using Carols Daughters products but I really like the Hair Honey as an everyday moisturizer for my ends and to smooth my natural hair in the front. I just use a little water and hair honey, tie a scarf for about ten minutes, and my all-natural new growth is smooth, soft, and exactly where I want it to be without using harsh gels, sprays, or spritzes. I am using this and the CD Healthy Hair Butter as a leave-in. I love the fact that its all natural ingredients that are really great and yummy for the hair. 
I JUST got out of the shower a minute ago, and I must say this is the best shampoo I've ever bought. My scalp hasn't felt this clean and fresh in a long time. Washing my super-thick and waist length hair didn't feel like a chore for once, and I actually look forward to my next washing. The smell reminds me of the hippie shops on Haight Street in San Francisco. I love it
For a guy who never paid attention to the face cream he used, I found H2O Plus to be amazing stuff.  Non-greasy, no heavy scents -- it's worth every penny
This is the second time I have ordered these blades for my husband. He has a very heavy beard and says these are the only razor blades he's ever used that last anywhere near this long, regular blades dull almost right away (sorry he's not here or I'd ask for the details from him, I don't know how long "a long time" is) but at 50, he's tried a lot of blades! He says never buy him anything else again so I guess these are the best!!!
As someone who really dislikes making up, but needs a bit of cover in her face powder, I have found Clinique's Superpowder to be just the right product. I have been using it for nearly ten years. In between Superpowder purchases I have tried other lesser brands and have always returned to this product. It is truly no muss, no fuss. No foundation, or concealers, just a nice simple matte powder that sets in naturally. No powdery bits sitting on the skin surface, no flaking ... and stays on all day with nary a touch up ... just perfect
I love this cleanser!!! I have combination skin and I sometimes have breakouts, especially when I am stressed. This cleanser is great because it sloughs off the dead skin without irritation. I also love how it doesnt dry out my skin! And I have a lot less breakouts now, and when I do, its not as bad as it used to be. Even if you have sensitive skin, this cleanser is perfect, of course there are other great cleanser options if you think this will irritate your skin. Also, this cleanser really helps to minimize/clean out your pores. I really noticed a difference after using it for only a week.I also recommend the Perfecting Lotion especially if you have slightly oily skin. I use it during the day and even at night(!)because it really improves my skin and I dont wake up with zits in the morning :)Plus, It saves me money since i dont have to by an acne treatment gel to put under my lotion
I have tried many different products and this one is the best. I rely on it for many years already and it always works faster than anything else I have tried. Four Stars because it leaves a thin barely but visible film on the skin where you apply it. You can gently blend it with a facial brush after it dries so then its no problem. Especially if under makeup
I use this constantly - I've bought every limited edition of the set that shows up at Sephora.  I don't blend it in though, I dab a line across my top eyelid and let it dry.  Not too much, but it's still so vibrant that a little goes a long way.  I've reccomended this to everyone
I originally wanted the Black Ginger Aromatic Candle, but after reading the reviews it seemed that the Red Currant is the all around favorite.  The smell is nice, but I think I expected something a bit different.  The candle's scent does travel throughout my home like others have stated, and it seems to be burning slowly.  The candle itself is fine quality, and comes packaged nicely!  If I found a scent that I liked a bit better I would be 100% pleased
This is a very lemony smell, and the sugar takes away the sour 'edge' of the lemon. It is simply only that-lemon and sugar, then it gets warmer and airy throughout the day.If you want to just try it, get a sample size one from ebay, or a mini perfumes website.If your considering the more expensive Clean fragrance but aren't sure about the price, Fresh Lemon Sugar is similar in scent, the only thing being left out is the laundry, 'air' fragrance
I love to wear Safari.  Several times a week someone will ask what kind of perfume I am wearing and comment how nice it smells.  I will continue to wear it until I can no longer get it.  Someone said it is discontinued.  Does anyone know?
The pictures posted here of the Paul & Joe blotting paper compact don't do it justice. The compact is very beautiful, large and all covered in a pretty flower-patterned material. Very feminine, very stylish, very pretty. My only complaint? I wish it had a snap or something so it'd stay closed instead of only folding...The price is a bit steep at first but fortunately, they did consider refills at an affordable price. In my experience, I haven't found different brands of blotting paper to be very different amongst themselves and this is no exception, it gets the job done adequately, only in a prettier package...As far as blotting goes, this one blots shine like it should but get it for the stylish case and the convenience of affordable refills
it smells good and made me hair relly soft. It did lighten it a little bit but I also used the blonde with it. After a while I think my hair will get even lighter. Highly recommended
This is my favorite soap in the whole, wide world. It makes me happy when I use it. It smells fresh, like the wind, the ocean, grass, sand. I don't know, it's just the perfect scent. I have both the "karma kream" lotion and karma dusting powder from Lush, and I love them as well, but the soap is still my favorite. Next time I go to their store I'm going to buy the biggest brick of this stuff that I can, because it's great! Just a simple gylcerine-based soap with a dark orange-red hue, but the smell is just so wonderful that every time I wash my hands it turns into some sort of new-age deep-breathing exercise while I try to get as much of that lovely scent into my nostrils as I can.I've found that this soap lathers better than others, but you have to be careful not to leave it in the shower all the time, or it will get soft and melt away with the condensation. Trust me, you don't want to waste any of this stuff by letting it leak into the drain while other people are using the bathroom! I leave mine out so it can make my bathroom smell really great as an added bonus :)Fresh, fruity, citrusy, with just a tiny hint of patchouli to give it an earthy note. Definitely a winner from Lush! As soon as I smelled this soap in their store for the first time, I loved this scent. As you can tell from the reviews, a lot of other people do, too
This gel-based mascara does an excellent job of creating long, separate, and well defined but natural lashes. If you like your mascara to have some oomph to it, you would want to look elsewhere. For those who can't stand a single clump, you may have found your new favorite! If you've ever gotten a mascara in a slender green tube in a Clinique 'gift with purchase' - this is the one. The one you buy is in a slender and slightly larger silver tube.  You can brush on coat after coat of this gel like wonder and not get a single clump! Wow! This mascara is fiber-free and has been opththalmologist approved for contact lens wearers. The Jet Black is a true black and the Jet Brown is noticeably brown on the wand but looks great on the lashes. As with all long wearing eye makeup products such as mascara, this one needs to be removed with an eye makeup remover.
Inis has a very fresh/crisp/clean scent that I love.  It's kind of a subtle scent and not overpowering, which is what I like about it.  It's also very androgynous so a man or woman could wear it.  Whenever I wear it people always sniff and make comments like "what are you wearing?" and "mmm! you smell so good.
Used the cleansing foam, then bought the moisture cream.  Whatever is in rice bran is truly wonderful, it cleanses without any dryness and a rosy glow has returned to my skin. Have stopped using my old department store stuff, replacing 4 of those products with just these 2 with better results. Good value on both, they should offer a deal on the shampoo and conditioner too
Having shaved with everything from cheapo disposables to Thiers-Issard straight razors, I have to say that the Merkur Progress is probably the best all-around razor available today. It has excellent heft and balance, and the adjustment feature is simple and straightforward. (Although I do agree that the numbered adjustment seems to perform a little differently depending on the blade used.) It is easy to keep clean--assuming you don't mind unscrewing it and taking the blade out to wipe off the head and frame. Having also used a venerable old Gillette "fat boy" from the 1950s, I'd still have to rate the Progress as a better razor; the screw operated adjustment makes it constantly adjustable, not just in steps. Since this is a safety razor, its performance is significantly dependent on the blades used. I've tried both the Merkur blades and the Japanese "Feather" blades, and would say that it's a toss-up. And since it is an adjustable safety razor, it is perfectly suited to two-pass close shaving. A higher setting is excellent on the first pass with the grain of the beard, and a lower setting for the pass against the grain. The adjustment also allows you to adjust the razor to the conditions of your skin and beard. If you've let yourself get a day's worth of stubble (c'mon--don't we all?) you can set the blade high to mow that hedge. If you need a quick clean-up before a night on the town, you can set it lower for a "Once lightly, James."So if you want a really well-made, no-nonsense but very versatile razor that will last for a good long time, this is a good bet. The only problem might be preventing pals from swiping it, or reminding your wife/significant other to take it apart to clean it after she smooths up those pretty pins you love so well.One recommendation: Shop around. You can get these for under $40.00 if you bargain-hunt, likewise full 20-count boxes of carded Merkur 10-blade refill sets
I love the fresh scent of the Avobath, there's just nothing like it. It smells like springtime to me. I have yet to notice any glitter in an Avobath bath (and I've taken about 10) so if you're glitter shy, don't let that stop you from trying this one
I bought these with the also great socks and was completely pleased by the way they left my hands, hydrated and soft. After leaving them on for half an hour with the Glamour Gloves Gel my hands felt reborn. I couldn't get over how the moisturizers had penetrated. I've had these for a couple years and was almost sure they would stop working but they're still doing the job. I've recently seen less expensive gloves on the market and don't know how well they work but these are very high quality
Is so true of this product.  I have to admit when I first saw the price tag of this product, it was half out of curiousity that I purchased.  I mean could a pair of $20 tweezers be THAT much better than the ole $1.75 or $3 pairs at home?  Well if your asking yourself that question, YES!  These things have amazing grip and can pull the tinyiest of hairs.  Things that you would have to dig with normal tweezers until you finally rub your skin raw.Without a doubt, you will get your moneys worth from this product as well as be amazed at their performance.  It's the type of "WOW" that makes you feel like, "How did I ever get along without these before".Worth every penny and I'll never buy another cheap tweezer again.  These have lasted for years and still retain their fine point. 
	Mistral, as many know, is a powerful, gusty wind that blows across the south of France.  Mistral, as I was happy to discover,  is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters.	Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral,  utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms.  Derived  from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are  harvested primarily by women), this butter  is  highly emollient,  a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations.	The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being  triple milled).  South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island.  The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods.  An irresistible combination.	South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.	Highly recommended
I *love* this formula for my thick, naturally curly, slightly hilighted hair.  It does a great job cleaning without stripping, and this is the first conditioner that did a good job tackling my naturally curly hair without weighing it down.  I did get a good deal at my salon - $9 for the shampoo and a little more for the conditioner
Follow the cleanser with the Komenuka Bijin Skin Lotion and you may wonder why you are suddenly catching the scent of SAKE. In fact, this cleansing toner does contain SAKE along with Rice Bran, Seaweed, Aloe, Yeast, Glycyrrhizate, Orange, Lemon, Matricaria, Algae, Luffa Cylindrica and Fountain Water.The toner completes the process of removing impurities and also has the added benefit of contracting the pores so they look smaller. Men may also enjoy this as an aftershave lotion. ~The Rebecca Review
This conditioner leaves hair ultra-soft and doesn't weigh it down. If you have trouble with conditioners leaving a strong residue on your hair, this one won't.The ingredients contain rosemary infusion, lavender flower infusion, seaweed and fresh lemon juice. The lemon is great for washing the hair clean of residue. It's a great conditioner
Though I have never traveled the world, this perfume allowsme to feel like a veteran globe trotter It is sophisticatedwithout being obnoxious. I genuinely feel like a woman ofintrigue and experience. Though fanciful, it is fun for ahomegrown rose.
Bravo Pronto PregoVery nice product great shave and the Eucalyptus is divine
I've generally been a one-cologne guy -- I had settled into using Acqua di Gio for a number of years, after having used Nautica for a number of years as well. When she got pregnant several months ago, my wife confessed to me that she really didn't like Acqua di Gio (this after two years! Pregnancy does heighten sensitivity to smell, though). I still had some Nautica around, plus the original and no-longer-made Zegna scent from Spain, so I used those for a while. I then bought the newest Zegna cologne, "Z", after my wife smelled it and found it unobjectionable.  Well, no sooner had I bought the Z then my wife found a scratch and sniff of Curve in some magazine and said that I really should be using that. The next day we happened to be at K-Mart -- K-MART!!! -- for some household odds and ends, and my wife came across a display of Curve. She insisted on buying it for me. Ever since then, my wife goes nuts when I use it. I don't use it during the week, really -- I'm a somewhat older guy, and it has a sweetish overtone to it that's not very serious -- but whenever I do, my wife always tells me how absolutely wonderful I smell, indeed, how DELICIOUS I smell. Today was casual Friday at work, so I figured, okay. I leave for work very early, before my wife is awake. Sure enough, she calls me at work this morning -- "you used Curve today, didn't you? I can tell because the bathroom smells wonderful!"Every woman I know who has commented on it loves it on guys. So it's less expensive and available at K-Mart. And yes it is a little bit sweeter than most colognes I'm personally used to. But it does have a pleasant smell, and if the women love it, well . . . 
Naturally, with a name like Buffy, I would have tried this.  Whether I like it or not I get these on a regular basis from friends and family who see my name splattered all over it.  Lucky for me, I like.  Ever heard the expression 'soft as a baby's butt'?  Erm, no? Easy.  Simple to use, obviously.  No messing with jars or bottles.  Just go to town massaging those pesky areas - I'm convinced it works wonders on orange peel skin, and cannot be persuaded otherwise.
First of all let me preface this by stating that I literally just put this product on minutes ago. I have had a chemical peel over a week ago and was given Retin A and therefore my face was peeling so horribly, that I thought I couldn't leave the house. I mean my makeup would literally come right off. I was horrified! I tried several moisterizers sometimes multiple ones but could still see the skin flaking off onto my desk, so I researched this and went to Sephora and bought a kit. I washed my face, did the serum and added this product and I honestly do not see 1 single flake of dry skin, it does tingle but I think it's because my face is raw and so dry but it feels as if my skin is drinking it up like a cold glass of water. I am anxious to see what happens in the weeks to come. I have mild cyctic acne and have struggled with it for years. I decided to see a dermatolist and then got chemical peels it helped to rid me of the bad acne but then I was so dry for 2 wks I couldn't bare to even look at myself. My skin doesn't hurt anymore, for allthe sensitive people, there is a sensitve version but if you have dry skin from the crazy acne treatments they make us do or peels or just dry winter heat, this is the product for you. If it seems strong then use it every other night until you skin can adapt. Or just once a day. I hope you find this product helpful like I did becaus I am still looking in the mirrow that's at my desk
I love this stuff!! Five months ago I was diagnosed with having AK's (Actinic Keratosis -- lesions that can develop into squamous cell carcinoma/ skin cancer). My dermatologist recommended I use Skinceuticals CE Ferulic every day as it prevents thymine dimers (DNA mutations associated with skin cancer) with a medium exfoliator for a few months before taking more drastic measures to eradicate the AK's. My skin has never been healthier!! The lesions (which were scaly, itchy, and red) are healed and the overall apperance of my skin has improved dramatically and is much more even. My pores are smaller and I have a healthy glow. The CE Ferulic also is packed with antioxidant protection to help fight free-radical damage and provides photoprotection. HIGHLY recommended for those with AK's, uneven skin tone, large pores, or blemished or dull skin. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!
I'VE SEEN CAROL'S DAUGHTER ADVERTISED IN COUNTLESS MAGAZINES..I'VE ALSO SEEN IT ON "TYRA'S" TALK SHOW AND, AFTER HEARING SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT HER COMPANY... I'VE BEEN DYING TO SEE HOW GOOD IT IS FOR MYSELF...WELL....TODAY I RECEIVED MY CAROL'S DAUGHTER PRODUCTS AND I AM THROUGHLY PLEASED!!!..THIS ALMOND COOKIE FRAGRANCE SMELLS SO DELICIOUS!!! I LOVE HOW IT FEELS ON MY SKIN!!!...FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT WORKS AS GOOD AS IT SMELLS!!!
I love this product!  I look forward to the end of the day knowing that I can soothe my tired feet with Fair Trade Foot Lotion!  I've seen this product work wonders prior to this purchase--when my husband was in the army his feet were extremley worn and torn when he came home from Iraq--after using this product for several days, his feet looked and felt brand new
I reach for CK One on days that I want a crisp, fresh scent.  Intended to be a unisex fragrance, it is not at all sweet or flowery.  However, it does have a softness to it that I personally believe makes it better suited to a woman than a man; I find it to be slightly musky without being masculine.  Overall, this is a really nice, neutral fragrance for everyday wear
This is the best micro peel I have ever tried!  The thing I noticed first was that when I applied "when hope is not enough" and "the present"  they went on so smoothly.  They absorbed equally.  In my mid-30's, my young skin is fading, but this really brought it back.  I won't say I am 19 again, but I am sure the difference is obvious.  I am a hairstylist and my customers have been making mention of how great my skin looks since I added this to my bag of tricks.  It is a lot more effective that I would have thought, and I have not had a microdermabrasion since I started using this 2-4 times per month
This is such a nice, lightweight conditioner. And makes my hair smell super clean and fresh
I bought this perfume about one year ago with a gift certificate.I was skeptical about purchasing perfume online but I was not dissapointed. This perfume is absolutely fabulous! When you first put it on the floral freshness and ruby grapefruit awakens your senses as the top notes. The middle notes included a powdery musk that is sensual yet not to woodsy. And the bottom notes of jasmine are so graceful yet grasping.Buy this perfume. You will fall in love with it
At first spray, this can be a pretty potent cologne, but after 1-2 minutes this fades into a nice rosey spice scent that is much lighter than it's green original polo brother. lasts all day long and into the night. Worth checking out if you are a fan of cool water and lotto, or lighter scented cologne.
This is the best perfume that I have ever used.  I tried Estee Lauder, Lancome, and I always come back to Paloma.  The scent is wonderful and it stays on your clothes for a long time.  BUY IT TODAY
The wipes work well; they do not irritate my daughter's face.  BUT they STINK!!!!!  I usually use them before she goes to bed so that I don't have to smell her skin as it makes me nauseous
I've been using Murad for about 3 weeks now, and it has made a huge difference! I am in my early 20's and have had problems with mild breakouts since my teens. I've tried drugstore products, wich never seemed to make any difference, and Proactive which was so harsh it actually burned and made my skin much worse. Murad is gentle enough for me to use twice a day, and has left my skin breakout free! It has also improved the texture and feel of my skin, and makes my pores nearly invisible. I recomend Murad to anyone whose skin is breakout prone but too sensitive for the benzoyle peroxide formulas in other acne products. The only complaint I have about Murad is the price - it can be a little much for a poor college student - but the results are worth it if you can afford it!
This book was someone else's bookclub selection, and I think having no expectations when I picked it up really helped in my having that WOW experience that some folks report with this book and others miss. Yes, the prose needed much better editing: overuse of repetition, "stock" phrases, and "hanging" assertions that should have been cleaned up.  However, I found the discussions of brain development/evolution, similarities between certain animal behaviors and human behaviors, development of language in different animals, and the coevolution of humans and dogs to be facinating (oops, just gave away the ending!).  I found the side discussion of outcome-based audits interesting and enlightening.  I also liked Dr. Temple's recommendation that people with autism be hired for baggage checking positions.  Great idea! Although the book really goes all over the place, I found it a wonderful opportunity to engage my "seeking/hunting" motivation (you'll have to read the book for that one), and worth wading through the flaws to pick up the nuggets of gold
Beautiful, stunning absolutely gorgeous.A quick note to fellow Brits, this was ordered on October 22nd and arrived on November 1st and is much cheaper here than on amazon.co.uk or anywhere else in the UK!! I've ordered stuff domestically that has taken longer in the post!!
Great story!!  Excellent in fact.  My beef is with the narrator and editor:As someone who grew up in the Baltimore area, I thoroughly enjoyed the local references.  However, it is frustrating to hear the narrator mispronounce Baltimore icons, like Boog's BBQ at Camden Yards.  For the record, it is NOT pronounced Bow-g!  It is Boo-g... Do better research!!
Tom Friedman's writing style is easy to read and his overarching concepts-webs and walls; states v. markets v. individuals; and the comprehensive failure of the Arab street, leadership and Muslim clergy to combat the really tough and valid questions of the day-are extremely well thought-out. From reading this compilation of NYT columns, I understand where Friedman conceived many of his ideas for his current best-selling book, 'The World is Flat.' Although I sometimes disagree with his opinions, his ability to see the big picture is spot on
This book, Styron's finest, is about redemption.  Heralded by the epigraph from John Donne, the intricately structured tale with its Marlowian manipulations of narrative points of view soon becomes so enthralling that  it's impossible to put down.  But it's also to Styron's great credit that  the novel's theme, redemption through confrontation with death and  violence, is reflected through its feverish style.  There are not many  books in the postwar era, and none in the United States, that have such a  non-moralistic but intensely moral character and impact.  Echoes of the  Greek tragedians (several times evoked in the text) and of Dostoyevski  abound.  Finally, the crucial role by the most-fleshed out non-expatriate  character, a philosophical Italian small-town cop named Luigi, elevates the  moral drama to a metaphysical dimension that most contemporary writers  don't even seem to understand, let alone approach.  It's a shame that  Styron has not received the Nobel Prize yet
Painstakingly compiled by Judy Brown (contributing writer and comedy critic for LA Weekley), The Funny Pages is an impressive and hilarious collection of 1,473 jokes gathered from the funniest modern-day comedians around, ranging from Robin Williams to Bill Cosby, George Burns, Conan O'Brien, and many, many more. The individual jokes are arranged by topic underneath dictionary-style headings. From Alcohol to Yoga and Zoos; each gag is short but sweet, and packs a punch in this chuckle-inducing, highly recommended anthology of wit, gags, and humor both classic and cutting edge
These are all short stories, some very short; that's what he wrote. I remember reading a number of these (the science fiction ones mostly) in translation years ago. Rereading them now in the context of all his other work was really very interesting. As a collection of all his fictions, some of the items are a bit repetitive; the variations on the "knife fight" theme for instance. But the range of his imagination is fascinating, particularly in his thoughts about reality vs imagination and layers of reality and identity: a lot of it presages the information-based world of today, which sometimes seems to have left hard reality behind.Perhaps the link to the internet is one reason Borges seems to have a bit of a following these days among technophiles. Is not the web exactly Borges' "Book of Sand" - a place that absorbs us with fascinating and unique pages of information, but when we turn to find them again, we never can? And how long will it be before an imagined "Orbis Tertius" engulfs entities such as the wikipedia we think we can rely on (one might suggest it's already happened - look up Tatooine, for instance...) What exactly is information when it's just a bunch of ones and zeros - everything's already been written in the "Library of Babel" after all!The other fascinating thread to me was the influence of Arabic and Muslim themes; I'd never caught that before, but this collection includes a number of stories with an Arab perspective. Perhaps this is a well-known part of Spanish heritage; in any case, it was certainly interesting getting to know Borges through this collection, from the knife fights to the Arabian courts to the Immortals - not everything was great, but enough great stuff to be really worth spending some time with
There is little more I can contribute to this literary masterpiece--even though the essential structure of my review is clear in my mind, it will not be able to truly capture the magnificent splendor of this work. Gustave Flaubert was a conscientious literary artist who revised and perfected Madame Bovary with care. He worked on the novel for nearly six years, during which time he rewrote the manuscript several times, often spending days perfecting a single paragraph. The result of his painstaking creativity was a masterpiece that rivals the heavens with its beauty. Madame Bovary is a penetrating psychological study of its heroine, Emma Bovary, as she struggles to find fulfillment through a realization of her romantic fantasies of love and wealth. She exists in a dream world and longs for freedom from her middle-class humdrum lifestyle. Flaubert's realistic portrait of the tragic fate of this complex woman is nothing short of phenomenal.In perfect contrast to Emma, Flaubert introduces Charles Bovary, a proto-typical doctor who has no real talent or ambition and is content to enjoy the simple things that life has to offer. Soon after their wedding, Emma becomes disillusioned by the bumbling Charles and yearns for a romantic interlude. Flaubert represents the absolute clichï¿½ of provincial life with his portrayal of this undemanding, unimpressive, and unnoticed middle-class man. Flaubert brings all facets of human personas full-circle with the shy, well-mannered, and well-liked young man-next-door, Leon. With a slow-blossoming relationship with Emma, Leon leaves for Paris to study law. Upon his return--and with a little experience--the two become lovers. Flaubert's portrayal of this dysfunctional couple is reminiscent of tragic romances of yore. Thereafter, the degeneracy of Emma's lifestyle is evident, and she is brought to the brink of destruction.In Madame Bovary, Gustave Flaubert gives us a vivid and life-like glance into the reality and the mannerisms and the customs of small-town people living in France during the mid-nineteenth-century. Flaubert's descriptions are detailed and beautiful--and paint a real portrait of the natural world he is describing. Opening with first-person narration that sometimes shifts to third-person has earned Gustave Flaubert the reputation as one of the most celebrated and influential novelists of the nineteenth century
This book is another excellant addition to the growing body of knowledge and accessible information on a health problem that plagues many Americans.  Adrenal fatigue and its consequences and causes should become one of the most crucial topics in health maintainance.  Another excellent book in this vein is Dr. J. Wilson's, Adrenal Fatigue, The 21st Century Stress Syndrome
These are true tales from a clinical neurologist's notebook, but this isn't just any neurologist.  Oliver Sacks, author of the justly celebrated, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986) and Awakenings (1973), which was later made into a movie starring Robert DeNiro and Robin Williams, and other works, is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity.  He has a style that is both affecting and fascinating, yet studiously objective, a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations, historical comparisons and wisdom.  Part of the power of these tales, and of all of Sacks's work, is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality.  This makes for a compelling read.  If you've never read Sacks before, you are in for a very special treat.These tales are paradoxical because "Defects, disorders, diseases" can bring out "latent powers, developments, evolutions, forms of life, that might never be seen or even be imaginable, in their absence."  It is this "'creative' potential, that forms the central theme of this book" (from Sacks's Preface, page xvi).The first tale, "The Case of the Colorblind Painter" is about a successful artist who worked in color all his life only to became colorblind at age sixty-five, and the effect this had on his life and work.  The second, "The Last Hippie" is about an amnesiac man with a frontal lobe tumor that left him stranded in the sixties.  Sacks tells this sad, pathetic story with vivid detail, and characteristically ends it with a footnote, a footnote of such warmth and genuine identification that we are moved to tears.  (Don't skip the footnotes!)The third tale, "A Surgeon's Life," is an amazing account of a Canadian surgeon with Tourette's syndrome.  It is here that we begin to see the central theme of this book in brilliant illumination.  Dr. Carl Bennett, riddled with the bizarre tics characteristic of the disorder, compulsions that cause him to throw things, to touch things again and again in a ritualistic manner, to flail, jump and jerk about, nonetheless became a very successful (and beloved) doctor of surgery.  Sacks scrubs up with Dr. Bennett and goes into surgery with him, during which, miraculously, the tics disappear for however long it takes to complete the surgery.  Sacks visits him at home and meets his wife and two children, sees the dents in the refrigerator and on the walls, and comes away with a sense of how astounding the human potential to overcome adversity can be.The fourth tale, "To See and Not See," is about partially restored sight and how it was not a blessing.  This sad story illustrates how sight is learned from infancy and is largely a constructive and interpretive function of the brain.  This tale also lets us see how the world of the sightless can be rich and fulfilling beyond our imagination.	In the fifth tale, "The Landscape of His Dreams, we meet a gifted artist, Franco Magnani, who from memory alone recreates his home town of Pontito, Italy through his paintings.  He has a nearly photographic, three-dimensional memory, but because of a strange illness that befell him when he was thirty-one, he cares only to re-create his Pontito, not the people or events, but the houses, the masonry, the stones, and he does so continually with microscopic and affecting detail.The chapter "Prodigies," focuses on an autistic artist, Stephen Wiltshire, whom Sacks is determined to befriend and understand.  In this tale, and the concluding tale, "An Anthropologist on Mars," Sacks helps us to penetrate the world of the autistic and see it (at least in my interpretation) as an alternate view of reality, a view with its own strengths and weaknesses, a world that is just as true and valid as the "normal" one.  Of course severe autism is debilitating in the extreme, and even modest autism can permanently scar and alienate the autistic from society.  Yet, perhaps that is society's loss.  I even got the sense, in reading these concluding stories about autism, that perhaps theirs is an evolutionary "strategy" trying to emerge, that is, a different way of seeing and dealing with the world that also might work.  I would not be shocked to discover some day that the autistic, with their sometimes extraordinary gifts of memory and concentration, are melded more completely and seamlessly into our usual consciousness, and that humankind is the better for it.  Incidentally, the last tale about Temple Grandin, who is a professor of animal studies at Colorado State University, is remarkable because it is about an autistic who is completely integrated into the society, yet remains autistic.  She is the one who says she sometimes feels, because of her different perspective, like "an anthropologist on Mars" when she views "normal" people.  Sacks allows us to see why.Bottom line: this is an extraordinary book of insight and scholarship about the human condition, written with grace and a deep sense of humanity, not to be missed
I got this book when it first came out and read it straight away.I absoloutely loved it and highly reccomend it.Lief is trying to be a great ruler, but can't, not with the famine and death in Deltora.But with a perilious map, our heroes set out to destroy the four sisters that are causing the deaths in Deltora.An exceptional addition to the previous books and is reccomended to fans who want a little more adventure in their reading.Well done Emily Rodda!I like this book as much as all the others, this is the best Deltora series and I say it proudly, but after all, Deltora Quets hasn't finished, not yet
Definitely a wonderful book. For those following the teachings of the other books, this book provides more useful information. The path that Castaneda elucidated is fraught with controvery and extreme views (read the other reviews). I found it useful to read and judge for myself. What Castaneda wrote about is not fiction however it is a difficult path that very few ever advance upon, thus the angry reviews of those  calling Castaneda a fraud due to their own failure.  Its also a path that those given to fantasy and believing in their own 'specialness' jump on and thus follow blindly with no lasting gains, making up their experience as they go and making sure others hear about it.Definitely not a path for everyone but certainly open to sober verification.  Also a great book for those looking for a well written and gripping book.I believe Castaneda's genius as well as his contribution to mankind is yet to be fully appreciated. I am grateful for the gift of his writings and wisdom
Suze Orman is excellent in providing advise on all aspects of your financial present and future. It is full on tons of advise covering all avenues of your financial life. Very helpful and resoruceful
This book is beautifully constructed, concise, gracefully written, and should be of immense help to most golfers.  If you've read Ernest Jones, Percy Boomer, or Jimmy Ballard (for example) and enjoyed the insights but found it difficult to transfer the written word to your swing, try "The Keys ...": You will read a book that may finally lead you to improve your game.  My swing improved markedly after I came to understand author McTeigue's "lighthouse turn" (Lesson Two: Momentum).  
Steven Pinker has written a fascinating account of how language works; how we, as listeners, process the sounds that make up words and sentences in a way that allows us to extract meaning. The book is clear, entertaining and very accessible; Pinker's writing style is witty and engaging.My appreciation of the book is not only as a reader and enthusiast of language, but also as a writer; despite having been writing for years, and having studied numerous books on writing style and technique, it is "The Language Instinct" that positively impacted my writing more than anything else that I've read; an understanding (at least a partial one - I'm no expert) of the way your words will be parsed by the brain of your reader can be very valuable in one's attempt to write clearly and well.I highly, highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning something new, and being entertained in the process.Danny InyAuthor of "Ordinary Miracles - Harness the power of writing and get your point across!"

I was referred to this book by my midwife (Debra O'Conner) as a book that I had to read as it's content was so &quot;right on&quot; and was she ever right.  I know alot about my body.  I am a licensed massage therapist and a mother of a 3 year old that I had at home.  I spent hours and hours learning about my body during the childbirth process.  That was great knowledge to add to the physiology I learned during my massage training.  This book though, is something that every woman in our culture today should read. I now understand so much about my life and the directions it has taken!  I hope to give this to everyone I know who has a daughter.  I hope they will read it for themselves and then pass in on to their daughters when they feel the time is right.  Our culture today is so lacking in this kind of positive message.  It is women's reality and needs to be shared.  Of course it is written by a Midwife!  Thank you Elizabeth
I am married to a native New Yorker and we spent an entire weekend looking over this book and talking about many of the wonderful places it mentions, many of which we still visit today. As an extra bonus for avid cooks, there are recipes. For anyone who remembers Luchows or any of the other venerable, now closed restaurants the book mentions, it will take you back to happy times and good memories. It's an excellent book and clearly Schwartz has poured a great deal of research into what is his labor of love.
A remarkable introduction to Ezra Pound.  Makin explains some of the underlying structures that order the Cantos--periplous, ideogram, fugue, the 'repeat in history'--and gives concise readings of individual sections  that helped my understanding enormously.  He does an especially good job of  connecting Pound's theory of money to his views on sex and creativity.   Makin manages to be critical of Pound while treating his ideas with verve  and sympathy;  the writing is colloquial, witty and jargon-free.  I enjoyed  the Cantos much more after reading this short, effective study
Dragons are certainly among the most quintessential elements of the fantasy genre and their likenesses comprise one of the cornerstones of the art associated with it. DragonArt: How to Draw Fantastic Dragons and Fantasy Creatures is both an enjoyable browse and a useful guide for anyone interested in creating their own dragons or other fantastic creatures with pencil and paper. DragonArt is divided into three major parts, Fantastic Dragons, Unique Details, and Other Fantasy Creatures, along with an introduction, a section on how to use the book, and a brief guide to fantastic creatures. Lessons in this book are progressive in nature, beginning with fundamentals and moving into increasingly advanced aspects of dragon design, all illustrated with step-by-step illustrations that are punctuated by helpful tips and tricks throughout. And author/artist Jessica "NeonDragon" Peffer has a clear, easy writing style that can be easily comprehended, absorbed, and acted upon, an example of which follows below. "Okay, so we're going to discuss the anatomy of a creature that exists nowhere but in our minds. Sounds kind of silly to say that something made from pure imagination does not look correct, but that will happen if your creature doesn't look believable. To help make your dragon as real as possible, base its structure on real creatures," she writes at one point (page 44). "The ideal dragon is likely a mix of cat, bird, and reptile body types. The trick is choosing which parts to keep and which ones to throw out. You want it to feel like a single creature." This advice, incidentally, is very reminiscent of that given by Leonardo Da Vinci in his notebooks for drawing creatures of this ilk, making Peffer well read or naturally very insightful, either of which speaks well for her. Under "How You Should Make an Imaginary Animal Look Natural," the increasingly famous Renaissance man writes, "You know that you cannot invent animals without limbs, each of which, in itself, must resemble those of some other animal. Hence if you wish to make an animal, imagined by you, appear natural -- let us say a Dragon, take for its head that of a mastiff or hound, with the eyes of a cat, the ears of a porcupine, the nose of a greyhound, the brow of a lion, the temples of an old cock, the neck of a water tortoise." DragonArt also includes guidelines on drawing a number of other sorts of fantastic creatures, including basilisks, chimeras, gargoyles, and griffins. For those interested in applying the guidelines presented in this book, a companion DragonArt Kit: How to Draw & Paint Fantastic Creatures that includes a compressed version of the book and some art supplies will also be available soon. Author Peffer is also the creator of the popular fantasy art Website NeonDragonArt.com, which can give anyone potentially interested in this book the opportunity to get a sense of the kinds of creatures they can learn to create themselves.
First Book I've read from Sandra Brown and it was really great. It was a page turner from beginning to end. I found the book interesting and easy reading. A well written mystery suspense that keeps you guessing until the very end. Will not be the last Sandra Brown novel for me
When I first read the title, my first thought is "I know this, I've heard it before".That is how I felt. Until I read the book. What an eye opener! I happen to be one who rarely gets sick, and recovers quickly when I do. I also tend to opt for a healthier life style. However, there is a family history of cancer. In reading this book, I realized that there is even more that I need to be doing to protect myself and my family. Dr. Rapp has done a considerable amount of research and shares her findings with the reader. Research references are listed at the end of each chapter for those wanting to learn even more.If you own a home you need to read this book. If you rent a home or apartment, you need to know the information in this book. If you golf or live near a golf course, this book is for you. If you have children or grandchildren in school, consider reading this book
I found this book very helpful in outlining the importance of research &amp; of tracking earnings estimates. Mitch Zacks gives a good overview of what the key factors are in determining whether a stock will perform. The Zacks Rank was also interesting as it looks like it has performed very well over the past years...It seems as if the Zacks Rank really is accurate, and more imporartantly a successful investing method...This is the first book I have read that has actually helped  me make money, rather than just provide broad based market overviews one sometimes reads. Overall good book, I would definitely recommend it
This book is an excellent guide to building and managing an investment portfolio.   It doesn't promise that you'll make millions. . . but it does provide the principles and strategies you need to create an investment portfolio for long-term growth. It's intelligent, easy to understand, and practical. 
These books will one day be recorded as history told before its time. While the mainstream shurgs him now, he will be required reading years to come
Lee Smolin is a very deep thinker and original physics theorist, ready if needs be, to question cherished assumptions. One is humbled at how fertile his mind is and how he is familiar with the ideas and the research of so many peopleThe book is mainly an account of his misgivings about string theory, where he initially states, as he sees it, the five big problems in physics. In this context, he makes the very important point that since the end of the 1970's there has not been a single breakthrough in our understanding of elementary particle physics and, in particular, he claims string theory does not achieve such a breakthrough. In making his case against string theory he discusses what string theory has given and shows how it appeared to offer a solution to some of the problems of theoretical physics. But then he builds up his case against the theory. He says that string theory does not reproduce the standard model, probably the most successful theory in physics, but even predicts particles not seen in nature. It did not predict and does not cater for dark energy, nor does it make new precise and falsifiable predictions. In particular he says string theory does not offer a solution to the foundational problems of quantum mechanics.  He also notes that here is no complete formulation for string theory. He shows though how the five versions of string theory could be unified if membranes rather than strings were assumed, but notes that this theory, M theory, still remains a tantalizing conjecture. He says hopes for a unique string theory have receded.This reviewer would not dare to comment on his assertions but will say that any assertions he makes, are based on a very thorough knowledge of modern theoretical physics and merit the full consideration and respect of the reader. Indeed new ideas are needed in physics as Lee Smolin says. We are missing something big. There is a feeling though that we are on the verge of that big breakthrough - that something just beyond our understanding at the moment will surface through the `murk' into our consciousness and revolutionize our knowledge of nature. The clues are there. To do this, Lee rightly says that the sort of people who see through universal assumptions and ask new questions are needed. He also says that progress sometimes requires deep philosophical thinking but sometimes does not. And whether it is `lateral' thinking or a breakthrough revolution in `conceptual' thinking, new thinking is definitely required. Lee concludes his book saying that what he intends to do is just that. He chooses to start with a paper of his on the relationship between quantum and thermal fluctuation. A good choice perhaps. I strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in physics and the current problems and mysteries in the area to immediately buy this book, if they have not already done so.
The Boston based author, Dennis Lehane, wrote a great detective story with a social background so great, it is almost more important than the plot. "Mystic River" differs from Lehane's other books and indeed raises him to the next level as a writer."Mystic River" is set in the fictional Boston suburb, called East Buckingham (the author explains it as an amalgamate of Dorchester, Charlestown and South Boston and it really feels like Dorchester), home mostly to white working class, with plenty of crime. I liked the background info especially since I could relate to it, knowing the area...The first part, which is the base and explanation for later events, takes place in 1975, when one of the three eleven-year old neighborhood boys playing in the street is abducted by two men in an apple-smelling car, and although he comes back after four days, his life as well as his friends' is changed forever. The ways of the boys soon part, Dave (the boy taken by the men) lives a quiet life, has a wife and a son, and likes his memories of being a football player in high school. Jimmy, the "bad boy", after doing some time in prison settles down as a storeowner with a nineteen-year old daughter from his first marriage, second wife and their two daughters. The third boy, college-educated Sean, becomes a policeman.When Jimmy's beautiful daughter, Katie, is found murdered in the park after a night out Dave comes home covered in blood, Sean gets assigned to the case. There are many leads to different people... But the case is difficult. Meanwhile, Jimmy and his family embark on the search of their own.The plot is very good until the end, and psychological details as well as the insights into the society are extremely accurate. The characters are very real, especially Jimmy and Sean, who are central to the plot. Their trauma after Dave's abduction made a lasting effect on their lives - in very different ways. They are complicated, multifaceted people, very well developed as literary characters. Some side protagonists, depicting perhaps types rather than individuals (Bobby, Roman, the Savage brothers, Sergeant Whitey), are very good. I was in the grasp of this book until the end - it is not only great entertainment, but also food for thought. The movie based on "Mystic River" with Sean Penn is equally moving - recommended for those with little time...
This book is simply incredible.  A more stimulating book I couldn't  imagine!  It's not that it told me so much I didn't know intuitively, but  seeing it written so distinctly in black and white really hit home.  This  is one to read if you really want to get a sense of just how dramatically  the world has changed.  Neal Gabler, tells it like he sees it and has a lot  of research to back up his views.  I love that he doesn't make judgements  or try to press an opinion on the reader.  It's left up to you to decide  how you feel about it all.  I find myself thinking of points he brought up  throught the day and seeing just what he meant by experiencing it in  &quot;real&quot; life.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I  wish it was a bit MORE in-depth.  It's so engaging that I can imagine an  entire college course being made from this book.  It is a book that's as  entertaining as it is informative, and that's the whole point
I have only read the Swedish translation of what I suppose is the "old edition", but judging by "Look inside this book", this new English-language edition incorporates much material from the old. Incidentally, the Swedish edition gives the authors name as Kallistos Ware, apparently his taken Orthodox name, while Timothy Ware is his original, given name. In Sweden, the Swedish translation of "The Orthodox Church" is the only readily available book on the history of the Orthodox Church. Apparently, its used informally as a textbook in some college classes on Church history. It also contains chapters on theology and worship.In my opinion, the book is a necessary introduction for those interested in Orthodox Church history. Its first chapters summarize the history of this Church during the Byzantine Empire, under Islam, and in Russia both before and during Communism. Of particular interest is the authors interpretation of the Catholic-Orthodox split, usually dated to 1054. The author believes that the so-called Fourth Crusade in 1204 was the real and final consummation of this split. However, the book must also be read with some reservations. The author is, after all, an Orthodox Christian himself. Its safe to assume that there is a certain bias here and there. For instance, Ware denies that the Byzantine Church was caesaropapist, a very untenable suggestion. At other times, he is surprisingly "liberal" for an Orthodox. For instance, he paints Mehmet Fatih, the Muslim conqueror of Constantinople, as a very tolerant ruler. I also wonder about his interpretation of the Church father Cyprian. Even so, "The Orthodox Church" remains an indepensable book for those looking for a short and concise historical over-view of this remarkable Christian Church. 
This is one of the best books I have ever read that captures the experience of visual impairment.  It is beautifully written and very evocative.  It will move those who are not visually impaired as well
I've just returned from a reading of this book by my philosophy professor, Dr. Luke Barber.  Although he only read from a couple chapters, it was easy to figure out that this book is definitely a must have for anyone who loves  life (or would like to learn how).  Containing good, useful (not to mention  funny) stories, you will be able to relate to the text easily and  effectively!  I plan on purchasing this book and I would definitely  recommend it to anyone interested (and even those that are not!)
I saw the movie in a theater when it first came out. I was a teenager and, although I believed it to be primarily a girl's movie, I did enjoy it. I've seen it several times since then, and it still has not lost its charm. When I finally did read the book, I was disappointed that the movie didn't follow it more closely. To me, these are two different stories. The Holly in the movie is likeable; the novella's Holly is a harpie who cares for no one or nothing else. (When my wife saw the movie, she remarked that Holly was, "an idiot.") However, the book's storyline is more interesting...more haunting, and the book's ending is more intriguing. The movie ends as a love story. The book is much more. And, oh yes, whatever you may think of Capote as an individual, the guy was a damn good writer
Overall, I think this is a very good book for someone who is trying to turn their health habits around, but is overwhelmed by all of the possibilities.  It also a good track to run on for someone who wants to implement important life changes in an easy step-wise fashion.  There is nothing fanatical about the recommendations and they can be easily implemented by almost anyone.One of the things I most like about this book is the encouraging tone and the prioritization of various changes that are made little-by-little in eating habits, exercise, etc.  This book recommends walking as the main source of exercise and gives some great arguments for why this makes sense.  I think there are also some good and simple nutritional guidelines e.g. eliminated trans fatty acids, eating more fiber, using more olive oil, etc.Mixed in with some well researched conclusions are Dr. Weil's opinions.  For example, he recommends a fairly simple supplementation regimen.  While it is true that not everything he says is necessarily supported by corresponding studies, it is also probably that some of it is on the mark, but the data is not all in or all of the variables are not possible to isolate.  At the least, I don't see where this level of supplementation would do harm to most people.I also like that Dr. Weil takes a holistic approach to health.  He not only looks at and talks about the body.  He also addressed stress and relaxation, life attitudes and other ingredients of a healthy life that impact on health.  While he is very commercial, he is also a Harvard trained physician and I do think that he has some very good insights to share.While in some ways I think this book can be better.  I would still recommend it to almost anyone, especially people who are intimidated by the idea of exercising and changing their life habits.  While not every suggestion might be on target, I am sure that if someone implemented ALL the suggestions over eight weeks, they would undergo a big positive change in the state of their health.  I have certainly found this to be true and I cheat on some of them   ;
I read Desperation and enjoyed it immensely much like i did with The Regulators also. This book is filled with suspense from page one. The book never drags in my opinion. This book though is not for the faint of heart. If you don't enjoy high body counts and gore then you will not like this book and will most likely put it down by the second chapter. But if you don't mind it at all like me you will enjoy the suspense he gives you and the twists and turns this book takes. The ending is by far the most suspenseful part. I also recommend reading Desperation first because you will probably understand it better and get a better look on what Tak is all about. The journal entries and newspaper articles are a very nice touch to the story and it lets you understand what is going on alot better also. I wish there was a part three to this but sadly there isn't. I can't choose between Desperation and Regulators because their both great but The Regulators does have the more suspenseful end to it. Although it is alot bloodier and may you even get a brief lump in your throat like i did when a tragic thing happens in the end. Keep up the good work King
I believe that the purpose of this book is to break the bad habbits that every single christian had adoptded and the negative infuences we've been absorving.I think that this book was made simple, so that it would be very easy to read, understand, use and remember the "BE's". It does not anti with anything, it's just conservative with what is believed to be true!It's inspiring that would help anyone who reads to envision grabbing your dreams and on how lucky we are to be in this generation with full of opportunities. Every chapter gives wisdom WHY do we have to BE; Grateful, Smart, Involve, Clean, True, Positive, Humble, Still and Prayerful
When I first discovered this book in a London bookshop, I decided at once that I needed to own it. It's large, it's bulky, but it's beautiful. It needs the large pages to illustrate the finest examples of Tom's works. As an artist myself, who learnt a lot from Tom's unique techniques, I appreciate what a fantastic collection of art, both colour and black and white, has been compiled into this collection. But it's not just pictures; there's an insight into the man himself, a delightful tribute to the Master of Homoerotic Art. This volume is a great tribute to Tom and a valuable tool for the new breed of erotic artists, like myself, waiting for recognition
Walzer's historical approach to examining just war theory is, I think, the most useful way to understand morality in war. That is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations. Walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here; he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying, if not prescribing, moral norms from which the rules have been extracted. Be forewarned, he does not cut the reader any slack. This book requires some serious attention to the author's train of thought.  Just war theory has two categories: the justice of going to war, and the justice of fighting once in a war. Walzer's discussion usefully and clearly separates the two and examines via historical events what we regard as right and wrong within each sphere. In doing this he has done the modern world a tremendous service. His logical breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what thinkers have considered right and wrong in war. One of the best outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the notion that "all is fair in love and war." That is the path of least moral resistance (or as Clausewitz would say, "friction"), yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers. What is amazing from the discusion is the realization that Walzer knows he has to attack that age-old notion, something our collective sense of justice has historically always rejected.  Yet it remains a prevailing idea for many.  Originally coined by the Romans it seems (Walzer quotes them, "In war the laws are silent"), they themselves were self-consciously contrite over the fates they inflicted on the Greeks and Carthginians.  The book rates five stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone.Some make the mistake of thinking Walzer is a pacifist--far from it.  On the otherside some critics find his argument about "supreme emergency" a moral failure and a cop-out.  The case of Nazi Germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency, one where normal rules may be relaxed, if ever so little, because of the especially pernicious nature of state-sponsored genocide.  The same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to Islamic terror. In contrast Walzer does not see Imperial Japan, for instance, as having represented a supreme emergency, and so the atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not be morally justified. Readers may want to compare his view to Paul Fussell's perspective in the essay "Thank God for the Atom Bomb."Significantly for current events, readers interested in the distinction between pre-emptive and preventive war will find a well articulated argument here. The US attack on Iraq was and still is often justified as pre-emptive.  That impulse on the part of the neo-conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus belli reflects, I think, a need to cloak a morally questionable war in the robes of legitimacy. There is no way that attack can be justified under the historically accepted norms of "pre-emption." Michael Walzer's well-thought distinction between pre-emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of asymmetric warfare against terror and Islamic radicalism, and it clearly shows why the Iraq war was a moral mistake from the start, regardless of its practical success down the road, if we are fortunate enough to see that. The moral precedent of engaging in preventive war will continue to haunt America long into the future. The fact that Iraq was not even on the spectrum where the fine line between pre-emption and prevention exists is a telling aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco.  Where one fails to recognize the moral high ground, one is doomed to moral failure. Walzer was vocal about the run-up to war in 2003, and those who read his book would do well to find his comments about the Iraq invasion; they are edifying in terms of understanding the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the world's police force
Private eye Philip Marlowe is asked for help to get to Mexico by Terry Lennox. Marlowe likes Lennox and agrees to help him, but later Lennox commits suicide in the small Mexican town of Otatoclan. But why was Lennox driven to such extremes?Later on, Marlowe is asked for his assistance in keeping the alcoholic writer Roger Wade on the staight-and-narrow. This is not really Marlowe's line of work, but he becomes entangled in the case especially as connections with Lennox begin slowly to emerge.This is a longer, more ambitious novel by Chandler albeit displaying the same cynical, tough edge as the other Marlowe novels I've read. The greater length allows Chandler more space for character development and reflection. The danger of this is that the novel could have felt over-extended, but for me it didn't. The ending did not come as a total surprise, but as with every other Chandler novel I've read, enjoyment of the journey rather than satisfaction at the quality of the destination is the important thing.G Rodger
They are books like those written by Stephen Ambrose which keep the flame of my interest in reading of times and events of long ago burning. Some have accused Ambrose of taking too many liberties with the facts. To those I would say, Bah Humbug! This book is well written and worthy of the readers time, unless, of course, you are a "fact-checker", in which case the original sources, to the extent they even exist, might be more to your liking.  For Orginary Joe's, like me, Mr. Ambrose has provided a good deal of reading entertainment and information. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be transported in time and place to the high plains during the Indian Wars
Sigmund Freud has done an amazing research in the field of Dreams and their meanings, you will be amazed how every single detail in the dream has a meaning (According to Sigmund Freud - not that I agree with him). And it is very impressive. Personally I enjoyed this book very much
I don't think customer Lee Kane is quite right when he says that Tag Gallagher's labour-of-love book is mainly about the films.  Gallagher's writing is spare and lean but he gives at least as much biography as the purely biographical books
This unforgettable story illustrates the crazy, life-changing adventure of a seventeen-year-old boy who struggles to let go of his fading childhood and accept the phoniness of the adult world. Holden Caulfield's loneliness and lack of motivation combined with a traumatic childhood cause him to leave behind his youthful days at Pencey Prep to venture into the dynamic adult world of New York City. Holden tries to hide his youthful innocence as he mirrors the habits of other adults, going to bars, drinking, and purchasing prostitutes. However, his bickering and sarcastic attitude suggest a hidden desire to stay young, a desire he stubbornly buries beneath his new, mature lifestyle. Holden, like many others, longs to live in a place that is simple and motionless, a place where one needn't worry about the past or the future. Holden also hopes to preserve the innocence in others, such as his sister, so they don't turn out like him, depressed and regretful. Through Salinger's vibrant attitude towards Holden's experience in New York, we readers learn to stop running from our past to prevent losing our youth altogether. The Catcher in the Rye has survived generations as one of the world's best bildungsromans, not because it illustrates the fading youth and growing maturity of a memorable character, but because it demonstrates the confusion of a character as he fights desperately to protect what remains of his childhood
Private Investigator Kinsey Millhone is back again in this fourth installment of Sue Grafton's alphabet series.  This time she is offered a fee to give a $25,000 cashier's check to a young man named Tony Gahan.  The check for the fee bounces and Kinsey is now looking for the man who gave it to her, plus the young man she is to give the cashier's check to.  Everything she finds out about her client is bad.  He is a drunk, who has killed several people in a car wreck, and appears to be a bigamist.  When he is found dead, Kinsey has plenty of suspects including survivors of the dead motorists and two angry wives.  This book is written in Grafton's usual breezy style, and Kinsey becomes more independent and more likeable with each book.  I would recommend the whole series to mystery-lovers
This book provides a fine introduction to the myths of Northern Europe.  The book examines the few remnants we have in the forms of epic poems and prose, written by Christian writers after the fact - the Eddas, Beowulf, and the Viking sagas.  From these sources, especially the Edda, the author reconstructs the myths and stories relating to the Norse gods and their subsequent twilight in Ragnarok.  Then, the author seeks to answer various questions about this myth and determine whatever relation it may have had to the original religion of the Northern European peoples.  The figures of Odin, Thor, Loki, Balder, and the rest of the Norse gods play an important part in our European cultural heritage and it is nice to see them presented in an introduction as here.  Whatever underlying mental constructs are behind such accounts as that of Ragnarok (the Twilight of the Gods) they certainly appear to be universal to the human race, as revealed in all forms of apocalyptic literature.  Ultimately these beliefs died a rather easy death at the hands of the Christian worldview.  Whatever your personal opinion about the replacement of the pagan beliefs by Christianity and whether or not the pagan beliefs should be resurrected or remain buried, you will certainly profit from reading this book and it will help you to better understand Northern Europe in pre-Christian times.  Finally, it must be noted that in many ways, at least in my opinion, the society of the Vikings was superior to our own.  I admire the strong sense of individualism that the Vikings expressed and enjoy greatly reading about their heroic feats
I affirm the positive comments of the other reviewers. I am a truck driver and dairy farmer and just finished the books on tape version of this book. I want to run away to graduate school and get at PHD in physics. I hated science in school.I especialy recommend this book because it affirms  true learning. It really doesn't start until you fall in love with a subject and go after it just for the fun of it and for the most part on your own. Much of the book is about his love of physics and scientific exploration. He touches upon how to do education wrong with his stories about science education in Brazil and his  work selecting K-12 science texts for the LA school system. My independent road of becoming a dairy farmer affirms his thinking, and I am so glad I did not try to get an Ag degree
This volume contains 152 middle length sutras which are mainly sermons to monks on buddhist practices.  Having compared the Pali original with the translation of about 12 Sutras I would give it a high fidelity rating.  The appendix contains extensive notes which discuss the text from the viewpoint of the Theravada commentaries.  A must read for those who want to learn or study using original source material and do not read Pali.  The introduction contains valuable material on Buddhism by a Bhikkhu long "gone-forth".  
i dont agree with the previous reviewer at all. my kids love everything in this book and if i find enough time i want to make every single toy. they are not scary looking at all. if you like knitted babes by claire garland, you ll love this one. there are 5 themes in this book: enchanted land: Princess and castle fairy dream: fairy and baby, flower pillow, unicornwild trail: cowboy and mustangset to sea: pirate and ratty, dinghymagical waterworld: Mermaid, fish, seahorse and crab, dolphinthere are also pages on knitting, crochet and stitching basics. this is probably not a book for a beginner, but if have some experience you ll want to get your needles, hooks and yarn and just get going. i can only recommend this one. 5 stars!!!
Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland has always been preoccupied with three very important things: dancing, dressing, and reading sensational novels. But doing these things won't get you a husband, or acquaint you with other young ladies, such as yourself. So, upon request from a neighbor, Catherine is invited to spend some time in Bath - a fashionable town, where Catherine will have the opportunity to interact with people of her own age and stature, who are not related to her. And that is where the naive Catherine meets up with the Thorpe family. Quickly becoming friends with Isabella Thorpe, Catherine begins spending much of her time with the illustrious, yet conniving family. And it is only when Catherine is rescued by Henry Tilney, along with his charming sister, Eleanor, and whisked off to their ancestral home, known only as Northanger Abbey. There, Catherine's choice of reading material - mysteries and ghost stories, that is - comes back to haunt her; for Northanger Abbey is victim to terrible noises in the night - such as creaking, and frightening winds, that leave Catherine feeling as if she is residing in a haunted place herself. The fact that the enormous house is filled with various locked doors, and a curious history only heightens young Catherine's suspicions, and makes her question what mystery and secrets are lurking within Northanger Abbey, and the Tilney family, in general.Jane Austen has been a favorite of mine since I was very young, but it was not until this past weekend that I happened upon NORTHANGER ABBEY while browsing through the bookstore, and decided to purchase it. I will admit that, hands down, this has become one of my favorite Austen books. Catherine is an enchanting character, whose innocence, and naivete make her charming from beginning to end; while her overactive imagination leaves the reader chuckling in delight at the many crazy notions she creates within that bright head of hers. Catherine's interactions with Isabella Thorpe, and the rest of the Thorpe family are intrepid, and truly make you feel strong emotion towards those particular characters; while the charming Henry Tilney - like Mr. Darcy - makes you root for a romance to blossom between our dashing businessman, and our young heroine. A wonderful, satirical piece of fiction, that should certainly be discovered by anyone who calls themselves an Austen fan.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspape
Janet Browne's far-reaching biography misses little in bringing us the life of the 19th Century's most controversial biologist/geologist.  The first volume of a two-volume set, "Voyaging", begins (as you would expect) with his youth in the English town of Shrewsbury under his father's care.  We meet his father - a Doctor and businessman, his brother - intelligent but unfocused, and his late grandfather Erasmus Darwin who was well known at the time for his eccentric and agnostic views.  From his early days, Browne depicts a Darwin struggling to find himself, first as a medical student in Edinburgh, then as a student of theology in Cambridge.  Though we know better what Darwin is to be, Browne's portrait of him manages to evoke the doubt that he must have felt when faced with adequate but uninspiring career options.But the story often returns to Darwin's love of the outdoors and of biology - a theme which underpins all of his early feints and mis-steps at life.  He is seen as a frequent hunter, and an avid collector and cataloguer of insects and beetles.  Despite this, and despite the benefit of hindsight, at times I felt some tension - finding myself unconsciously wishing to offer advice to this young man who seems adrift and unaware of the great role that history was preparing him for.  We finally catch a glimpse of that future as he fortuitously receives an offer to travel aboard The Beagle, a vessel bound for South America on a surveying mission.  I won't spoil the rest, other than to say that Browne does an excellent job of building Darwin, showing in detail each moment of discovery upon which the next is laid, capturing his excitement about the natural world as he slowly sheds his amateur standing and gains confidence - finally attaining acknowledged scientific stature.  And yet even then, Darwin holds his boldest work out of sight of the world, privately developing the theory of natural selection out of sight of a straightjacketed Victorian society.In tenor, it's clear that Browne, a Professor in the History of Biology greatly respects her subject.  But she does not allow him to pass through her pen unscathed.  Darwin was a man of his times and of a certain station, and held certain prejudices that the author doesn't hesitate to point out - such as his not wholly humanitarian attitudes about slavery.  She also reveals what some may find Darwin's less endearing traits such as his anti-social tendencies and his lack of any real passion for any subject but science (When approaching the subject of marriage, Darwin's priority on research causes him to discard several eligible but too learned women who, he feared, might place demands on his time).  She does seem to soft-pedal Darwin's poor treatment of his companions on The Beagle, many of whom contributed significantly to his efforts on that seminal voyage, and whose contributions went largely uncredited and unrecognized.  (For those curious, this theme is well-explored in Robert Wright's "The Moral Animal")Also, it was difficult for me to follow the various people who pass through his life and their relationship to him, more my failing than the author's I think, as she provides ample details on the many individuals who made an impact on Darwin's life.  If you do decide to read it, it might be helpful to keep a pen and paper handy for jotting down a few notes (although the author does append a fairly extensive family tree at the front of the book).Certainly, the book is well worth reading for anyone with more than a passing interest in exactly how the theory of evolution (and the legend of Charles Darwin) was born.  I've read few biographies better
This book melded two things I never thought I'd see in one book.  The Salem Witch Trials and modern drug research.  Sounds a little weird at first, but Robin Cook makes it work.Alot of mystery as well as some insight into the past of 17th century Salem, Ma make this a very engaging read.  As with other books by Robin Cook, none of the characters is perfect which always makes his creations easier to relate to, no matter how rich, smart, etc, they may be.Great read! Very exciting endin
Some long ago inventer discovered that if you place carefully shapped rocks just so they will remain in place as an arch, dramatically reducing the amount of stone you need to hold up a bridge, an aquaduct, or the entrance to a castle. It probably wasn't too much later that someone recogniced that a bunch of arches next to each other would yield an arched ceiling to a room. My guess is that it then took a very long time for someone to recognize that if you made a series of arches in a circle you could make a domed room. But as soon as one was built, I suspect that a priest of some kind looked up and immediately saw that a minature version of the sky had been created, and that an artist could transform this sky into a 'Vision of Heaven.' This book shows what decoration has been applied to the insides of domed buildings from about the second century to the twentieth. It is an absolutely spectacular set of photographs of how artists have brought the heavens down to earth.
I haven't completed the book yet, but so far have found it to be very insightful and enjoyable.  It begins in Genesis and continues from there hitting on the most commonly read Bible sections to the not so often or  seldom read sections.  He ends everyday with a thought provoking question  to think on through out the rest of your day. I always look for to the next  reading
Mill states here that he still believes traditional gender roles (as we now call them) are desirable, but, being John Mill, he passionatly believes in the freedom of lifestyle choice for the individual.  Hard to argue with that
Like many of the other reviewers here have already stated, this is a book to be read by everyone!  I am not a reader of westerns but I loved this book.  After 800 pages I was never so sad to see a book end.  "Lonesome Dove" has a little of everything, drama, action, humor, and a few love stories to boot.  There are few books that have made me laugh or cry like this book did.  By the time your are done you will have new friends Woodrow, Pea Eye, Claire, Lorena, but especially Gus McCrea.  and you will also have some new villains particularly the frightening Blue Duck.  I can't recommend a book any more than this one
In this book you get 35 projects/designs marked with skill levels needed for each project. The projects are mostly made with wire, but pearls are also used, in most of the projects.I would say that this is a book for you who has made jewelry before and are familiar to wirework. If so It is a wonderful book! This book offer lots and lots of inspirasjon and expertise
The color tabs really help you know what section to look at. The only disadvantages of this field guide are that it doesn't document every species in North America and that the new National Geographic Field Guide to the Birds of North America, Fifth Edition has the Blue Grouse split into the Sooty and Dusky Grouse making it more up to date!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Still, this field guide has many good things.
This will be a present for my nephew George's 37th birthday. He lovedCurious George as a child, and still does. It's wonderful how someonecarries a love for a childhood toy, book, etc. throughout their life.Such an individual eternally has a special spot in their heartKudos to Amazon for providing the book for $5.00 under market price.
What can I say? More spidey than you can shake a stick at for peanuts. If you ever wished you had the patience to cut out and neatly collect all the Sunday paper comics in a nice neat scrap book then this is the book for you. I'm planning on buying the lot and thoroughly enjoying my strolls down memory lane
According to Charles Kimball, religion is the most powerful and pervasive force on earth.  Religion inspires humans to transcend their self-interests, while at the same time, more evil has been committed in the name of religion than any other human institution.  Using a comparative religious approach, Kimball uncovers five warning signs that increase the likelihood of a religion becoming unhealthy or evil.Kimball argues the word `religion' is amorphous and difficult to define.  As a result, the author believes a comparative religious methodology is necessary, one that sees the similarities and interconnectedness of all religions.  Kimball, next, asks if religion is the cause of evil, and he answers both yes and no.  A religion that is arrogant, condescending, and requires adherents to "disconnect their brain" is problematic.  On the other hand, religion opens up humanity to a universe of purpose and beauty and teaches how to live meaningful and moral lives as individuals and in community.  Kimball seeks to discover the signs that increase the likelihood of religion becoming evil.  The first warning sign that religion is displaying tendencies towards evil is the belief and adherence to absolute truth claims.  When conceptualizations of God are held with certainty and rigid doctrine, the propensity towards evil increases dramatically.   Sacred texts, sources of wisdom and guidance, become abused when selective readings of the text are used to reinforce these absolute truth claims.  Christianity and Islam have missionary mandates, but these become imperialistic when conversion is forced because of absolute truth claims.  Kimball argues for a "human view of truth", one that is dynamic and relational, allowing adherents to affirm truth without solidifying truth claims into absolute propositions.Another pivotal point when religion becomes evil is blind obedience: when adherents abdicate personal responsibility to religious authorities.  When a charismatic leader demands total obedience, has unrestricted power, and has total control, religion is unhealthy.  Uncritical acceptance of doctrine is also unhealthy, as authentic religion encourages questions and reflection.  Strict segregation from the larger society, combined with a leader with unlimited power is dangerous.  Kimball asserts that religious inquiry and freedom of thought are necessary for responsible religious adherence.Every religious tradition believes that something is awry on earth, while some believe that an ideal time will arrive in the future.  When adherents believe they can speak for God and wish to usher in this time, the likelihood for disaster increases.  Many Muslims embrace the hope for an all Islamic society, zealous Jewish settlers dream of a time when Israel will be returned to its divinely promised status, and the Christian Religious Right believe that America should be politically structured with Christian principles in mind.  Kimball opines those who narrowly define temporal structures of the state and those who believe they are God's agents to usher in a theocracy are dangerous.Religion also becomes a force for evil when the ends justify any means: when one theological component gets elevated, thus becoming an end, and adherents become consumed with achieving or protecting this end.  All religions have notions of sacred space, but an unhealthy religion becomes obsessed with protecting this space.  Reinforcing or protecting group identity against an `other', or protecting group identity from within the group, are also potentially dangerous signs.  Institutional structures develop in all religious traditions, but corruption occurs when the protection of the institution becomes the end.  Kimball asserts that a healthy religion preserves the connection between means and ends.The last warning sign occurs when religious leaders believe their struggle is a "holy" war.  Kimball outlines the history of pacifism to the just war theory and crusader ideals within Christianity, and he shows how each of these views were represented in the Gulf War of 1990-91.  Islam is a peaceful religion, which asks adherents to build a just and peaceful social order.  The word jihad means "struggling in the way of God," but in a narrower sense jihad is understood as a struggle in a military sense - with rules similar to the Christian just war theory.  Because of socio-economic disparities, some Muslims openly advocate violent means to achieve revolutionary ends, and some leaders declare this revolution as a holy war in order to legitimize their cause.  Kimball believes both that Christian and Muslim adherents should not speak of war but of peace and that the call for holy war is not holy.With the knowledge of when religion becomes evil, religions have a clear understanding of healthy praxis.  Faith, hope, and love should be the guiding spiritual compass for all religious adherents, so that in times of conflict unhealthy religious mechanisms can be averted.  Against secularism, Kimball finds validity in religious traditions because of the time-tested wisdom and ethical standards, and he believes that religions should embrace religious diversity.  With religious diversity Christians have three options, exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism, but Kimball believes each position has value if adherents from different faiths work together for the common good of humanity. Finally, the Middle East represents a microcosm for the world community: if peaceable solutions are not found in the Arab-Israeli-Palestinian conflict, then the future for the world community and world religions are bleak
Of all of Willard's books, this one was my favorite.	Willard offers a systematic study of the nature of being, and then proposes a pragmatic approach to setting the hear back on course to purity and submission to God.  A human being, he says (p. 30), is composed of thought, feeling, choice, body, social context and soul.  He states plainly (p. 41), "It is the central point of this book that spiritual transformation only happens as each essential dimension of the human being is transformed to Christlikeness under the direction of a regenerate will interacting with the constant overtures of grace from God.  Such transformation is not the result of mere human effort and cannot be accomplished by putting pressure on the will (heart/spirit) alone." Fundamental to this project is first dying to self, taking up the cross, and living in self-denial (chapter 4).  We must then go through a process like learning a new language.  The general steps he summarizes in the acronym VIM: vision, intention, means (p. 85).  These are a vision for kingdom life, the will to do it, and the means to carry it out.The rest of the book is structured around a look at the transformation of the mind (chapters 6-7), will (8), body (9), social context (10), and the soul (11).  The work of the mind involves being cognizant of the ideas and feelings that drive our society and our personal lives.  Instead we should be renewed with love, joy, and peace in the inner life.  The work of the will involves surrendering our will to God's, and then moving from abandonment to contentment.  Here the spiritual disciplines bring to light our duplicity on these matters.  The work of the body means realizing the over-emphasis we place on it and the need to cease idolizing and misusing our bodies.  The work of our social context involves noting the use of assault and withdrawal that characterizes our relationships (p. 181).  Lastly, the work of the soul, which Willard defines as the unifying factor of them all, is best summarized in Psalm 1.  We are to be renewed into new beings who happily fulfill the law of God.Again, I said this was my favorite of Willard's works.  I'm not sure any of the rest of them so thoroughly transcend from the theological to the practical without missing a step.  The systematic study of human nature is all-inclusive.  He lays out a blueprint of a kingdom vision of what the human being (emphasis on being) is.  The very nature of humanity, from the state in which we find it to the place it is supposed to be, is spelled out here.  The enormity of the work is amazing for such a readable text
This is Ann Waldron's best McLeod Dulaney mystery yet. The characters are so lively and well-drawn they literally walk right off the page (and, in some cases, right into your heart). The setting--the Princeton Theological Seminary--is perfect (a perfect place for a murder, that is), and the plot is downright diabolical. Are you in the mood for some humorous, mysterious and sinfully well-written fun? Then do yourself a favor and read this delightful book
I will start this review by noting two things. I greatly appreciated Nussbaum's 'Upheavals of Thought', and I am uncomfortable with the way sex sits in the society I live in. (But, then, I recognise things in myself that - for good or bad - change my perspective from that of the society I am embedded in.) But Wedekind's play 'Springtime Awakening' should raise alarm bells for most of us. We are sexual beings (most of us anyway) and we have to deal with that - learn to accept it within ourselves, learn to share it with others (it is, of course, the quintessential sharing experience), learn to grow with it, learn to let it go .... The easy path to take is to grasp a social 'norm' and follow it regardless of the morality of that path. Societies do present many 'norms' to a young person developing sexual awareness but not all of these are equally desirable. If Nussbaum's book does nothing else but diminish the acceptability of some of the undesirable 'norms', and enhance the more socially responsible ones it will have achieved a great service. There are curious things in this book for me. Nussbaum refers to many sources but many of them are male - Aristotle, Seneca, JS Mill, DH Lawrence .... To be fair, the last chapter is about 'To the Lighthouse' by Virginia Woolf, and other writers such as Andrea Dworkin are prominent. However I was surprised that some powerful women writers are totally ignored - where is Mary Wolstonecraft, where is Emma Goldman, where is Mary Shelley? Why is 'Maurice' (Forster) referred to but not 'The Well of Loneliness' (Hall)? The chapter on female genital mutilation (FGM) is an appalling indictment on the behaviour of some societies. Nussbaum has a glancing reference to circumcision; not surpringly it is glancing for someone who was converted (so I read) to Judaism. While I would never compare what happens to baby boys with what happens to young women in severity or risk, nevertheless I think the motivations for both practices come from the same source. If, for cultural (religious) reasons it is appropriate for Jewish boys to be circumcised, I think it is a very dangerous position to take to expect other societies to abandon the practices they see as legitimate, if not mandatory. The chapter on Equity and Mercy impressed me immensely - it is so balanced I expect many feminists will hate it. But for me, her rare use of a Christian quote ('Forgive them, for they know not what they do.') was a revelation. Never before had I seen how compromised that plea is. (Compare with Tolstoy: 'It is a wonderful thing to be loved because of oneself, but it is a far more wonderful thing to be loved in spite of oneself.') The fact that often I have other feelings than Nussbaum expresses does not concern me, because she often has perspectives that broaden or hone my own thoughts. In the chapter on prostitution and its illegality I had to agree with most of what she writes simply from a libertarian point of view rather than one of morality. The morality issues are complex - perhaps irresolvably complex. Just as there are men with 'dangerous' sexuality, so there are women. Perhaps it's only an issue for men because they demand or expect control. For me, all of Nussbaum's discussions seem to centre on the effects on women that prostitution entails - this is not inappopriate even though it may not be balanced. The problem I see with prostitution is that it panders to the man's 'need' to have sex. They can get it on demand. This reduces their sensitivities to the needs of the women in their lives, including the need (wise or not) for a woman to have a faithful partner. In Australia we had an advisor on women's affairs to the Federal Government write a piece in a newspaper where she expressed the view - based on her own practice - that a woman should always make sure her husband knew where the red light district was in a city they were visiting, so he could satisfy his 'need' when she herself felt incapable. For me this is an appalling suggestion - as if men cannot have self-control and should not be expected to. But, for all of that, like Nussbaum I would not see prostitution as worthy of being made illegal.For me this was a thought-provoking read. It had some incredibly ugly things to describe, to consider. But it helped me to structure my thoughts in this difficult area - perhaps it will help me guide my boys as they reach maturity. Other recommendations: 'Springtime Awakening' - Wedekind 'The Well of Loneliness' - Radclyffe Hall (I hated the outcome of this) 'Matilda' - Mary Shelley (her biographical details are worth exploring too) 'Godwin on Wollstonecraft' - William Godwin (Mary Shelley's father; Mary Wollstonecraft was her mother) 'Upheavals to Thought' - Nussbaum 'Living my Life' - Emma Goldman 'Let Me Alone' - Anna Kavan 'Conditions of Love' - John Armstrong
I recently re-read ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA prior to attending The Colorado Shakespeare Festival's performance of the ambitious play under the summer stars here in Boulder. Drawn from Sir Thomas North's 1579 English version of Plutarch's Lives, William Shakespeare (1552-1616) produced this romantic tragedy late in his career, around 1607, and published it in the First Folio in 1623. It tells the story of a doomed romance between two charismatic lovers, Roman military leader, Marc Antony, and the captivating Queen of Egypt (and former mistress of Julius Caesar), Cleopatra. When his wife, Fulvia unexpectedly dies, Antony is summoned from Egypt to Rome to mend a political rift with Octavius by marrying his recently widowed sister, Octavia. Of course, this news enrages passionate Cleopatra. She vents her anger on the messenger, but is quick to realize that Octavia is no real rival to her when it comes to beauty. However, Antony soon follows his heart back to Cleopatra's arms, abandoning his new wife in Athens. This leads to war, when Octavius declares war on Egypt. After Octavius eventually defeats Antony at Alexandria, Cleopatra sends a false report of her suicide, which prompts Antony to wound himself mortally. Antony dies in his lover's arms, and rather than submit to Roman rule under the new Caesar (Octavius), the heart-broken Cleopatra asks to have a poisonous snake delivered to her in a basket of figs. In the end, ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA is as much about new sparks re-igniting the flames of love as new political forces supplanting old political regimes. It is a play that reminds me that it is perhaps better to re-read and understand Shakespeare than to devour one bestseller after the next.   G. Merritt 
This book provides great insight on modern business development concepts and design techniques.  The framework provided will save hours of time spent building common libraries or frameworks.  The industry support via CodePlex and the CSLA forum site speak volumes of the value it provides. 
The Man of Her Dreams The Woman of His! is a book that is critically necessary today in light of our divorce culture.  Sadly, it equally affects Christians the sames as non-Christians.  Joel pulls no punches in assigning the blame to men's arrogance and poor exploitive biblical exegesis.  The back and forth style communicates the same cooperation and give and take necessary for successful marriages.  This book is must read for the engaged, newlyweds, and those struggling to stay together.  All cliches aside, this is a must read.Rodrick BurtonAuthor, The Moral State of Black America  
We love this book!  We have made many of the recipes that have all tasted great and are healthy.  We also gave it to everyone for Christmas and they all love the recipes too
This book is a quick read and a great introduction to artificial life. It combines something of the science, the personalities and the history of this field. For general readers with some technical sophistication it  affords an opportunity to broaden one's horizons without too much of a  mathematical stretch; for computer scientists who are thinking of their own  research it can give a general idea of some of the accomplishments in the  field and a place to start delving into the original research papers.  Read  it and enjoy the future
This unusual love story, set with the background of war and rainy london is beautiful and intoxicating.  The characters are palpable and beautiful both in their strengths and thoughts.  an engrossing book (i couldn't put it down, yet i dreaded the end) that should be read by anyone in search of beauty or life
I read this book the first time 7 years back and left a lasting impression on me, that's why when i came across it again after so many years i felt compelled to buy it and read again. Oh Boy am i glad i bought it! Since last time i read it i have read many romance novels, many great one and many bad ones too. i thought i might not like it so much the second time around because of all the exposure i have got to romance novels since then but i was wrong. This book still made my heart race, made me smile at Joe's attempts to make Ronnie laugh and still made me sigh at that sparks of atraction flying between them. Joe's character was just amazing, and most endearing was his insecurities.Here was a Navy SEAL,one of the toughest possible guys, and he was insecure about his upbringing and background. He felt Veronica would be ashamed to be seen with a guy like him. He was sooooo sweet. He was so cocky, stobborn and arrogant but he was scared of rejection from Veronica. Just goes to show how a person's outward appearence rarely show what is really inside them.i can't find any more book of this series , i am still searching for them. i know i have to read all of them.
My son loves to read, and he adores this book.  I personally love Trapani's books--while they are not always grammatically correct (the only reason why I don't give it a 5 star rating), they are beautifully  illustrated and bring to life some of the most well-known nursery rhymes.   It will bring a smile to your child's face
A Fresh Taste of Italy is a marvelous resource for	an array of recipes; terminology; history; and sources of ingredients. The author paints a glamourous picture of the great diversity that exists in Italian cuisine.  If you purchase only one Italian cookbook...this is the one to get
It is interesting to see how golems evolve from Pratchett's Discworld novel, "Feet of Clay" (1996), where they are speechless slaves of clay, to "Going Postal" (2004) where a well-educated but humorless golem serves as body guard and lecturer-in-morals to the new Post Master.  This is where it all begins...Commander Sir Samuel Vimes, of Ankh-Morpork's Night Watch pays a visit to the Dragon King of Arms at the urging of his new wife, who thinks Sam needs his own coat-of-arms now that he's been knighted.  Unfortunately, one of Sam's ancestors was a regicide so his descendent is denied an armorial bearing by the College of Heralds.  He does learn that one of his watchmen is actually the Earl of Ankh:  the inimitable Corporal Nobbs, who is forced to carry around a piece of paper signed by Ankh-Morpork's Patrician certifying that he's really human.Well, this is a bit of a come-down for Sir Sam, but he's got more important matters on his mind, including the murders of two harmless old men. One of them was beaten to death by a loaf of Dwarf bread.  His body was discovered by Captain Carrot and Corporal Angua, the only werewolf in the Night Watch, when they visited the Dwarf Bread Museum on their day off.The only link between the two corpses is a trace of white clay at both murder scenes.Subplots zigzag every which-way through "Feet of Clay."  Corporal 'Earl of Ankh' Nobbs is being courted by a group of well, nobs who haven't given up on the notion that Ankh-Morpork should be ruled by a king.  Captain Carrot, hereditary king of Ankh-Morpork who wisely refused the crown in "Men at Arms," is busy tracking murderers and emancipating golems.  Sargeant Colon is about to retire if he lives through a trip through the sewers with Wee Mad Arthur.  Corporal Angua helps a new dwarf recruit come to terms with her yen to wear lipstick.Death, who has at least a walk-on role in all the Discworld fantasies is still working on his sense of humor:  "I AM DEATH, NOT TAXES.  I TURN UP ONLY ONCE."If this sounds confusing, it isn't.  It's brilliant.  All of the story lines tie together according to character.  I don't know how Pratchett digs through the sewers and stockyards of Ankh-Morpork, and rubs together a monarchist plot with a bit of animated clay to create such a gem.I think he must use magic.
Along with "From Science To God" Mr Russell establishes himself as one of the masters of spiritual reawakening.  Although this piece has more doomsday in it than his later work, it has the same hopeful message and the same readability.  In both books Mr Russell never seems to lose the reader in scientific mumbo jumbo, even when discussing very complicated subjects.  That isn't a statement on his intelligence or research, but rather on his ability to communicate on all levels.  Neither does he offend when he deals with the spiritual aspects of his writings. In short everyone can sit around his table (well, almost everyone). Read'em twice.
Finally a book just for woman athletes!  I have had sports related injuries in the past and now I know what to do to prevent them.  I thought the information was great and presented in a concise and easy to follow manner.   I recommend this book to highly
This is a colleciton of seven or so stories told by a mouse to mice about mice.  It is one of those books that is simply fun to read, particularly to the wee ones at bed time.  The illustrations are quite good and the nicest thing about the stories are that they are just about as much fun for the adult to read as it is for the kid.  Very nice illustrations, well done.  Recommend this one highly.
Multiple reviewers of other Washington biographies recommended this abridgement over the book they were reviewing.  I am a reader, as claimed above, but I have NOT read ANY Washington biography. I still thought the  above information might be helpful to other seekers
We are in the last part of the 19th Century in this novel, and the Wild West has breathed its last. The book is peopled with real legends (Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill, Sitting Bull) and fictional curiosities (Jim Ragg and Bartle Bone - two Mountain Men, and No Ears - an Indian with exceptional eyesight). McMurtry relates a sad, elegiac farewell to times past. The ever-interesting characters and their views of the world, which are wise and funny and fascinating, make the novel top-notch in the McMurtry canon
Lately there has been a lot of talk about how great Ronald Reagan was as a president. This book shows that this is not even close to being true. Under his presidency we went from the number one loaner to the number one debtor in the world. Him and his administration sold missles to Iran inexchange for hostages and then illegally took that money to support Contras in Latin America. Under his administrations hands off approach wall street ran wild with illegal and immoral practices. All this happened while his administration held down the poor and middle-class while giving the rich more money. It is debated whether Reagan knew some of these things were happening hence the title of the book. It is a very good read and easy to fly through the whole book. The only complaint about it is the lack of an indept description of the savings and loan scandle and the dredded star wars program. Recommended for anyone intrested in learning what happened behind the scenes of this presidency
I've read many books on meditation and while each of them answers some of my questions, Jack Kornfield's book, A Path with Heart, answers every one save those that must be experienced first-hand in one's own time.  His  voice and advice is articulate, intelligent, humorous, open, patient and  wise.  He starts out by telling you a little about his own experience, goes  on to cover the basics of vipassana meditation and then leads you bit by  bit deep into the issues every meditator and spiritual seeker must face.   What I love most about his teaching style is that he gives gentle,  practical advice on the day-to-day, minute by minute stuff to do to  explore, commit to, love being on the path.  If my house were on fire and I  had to grab only one book on my way out the door, it would be A Path with  Heart
This book is for anyone who has ever questioned their faith, lost a loved one, or yearned to understand life just a bit more.  Sarah Darer Littman has captured Justine Silver, a confused Jewish girl, within the pages of CONFESSIONS OF A CLOSET CATHOLIC.Justine is surrounded by her faith, but no one seems to celebrate it the same way.   Her parents have one idea, her grandparents another. And then there are all those other religions -- which way is the "right" way? Bewildered by this, Justine seeks answers by deciding to adopt her best friend's Catholic beliefs.  With the help of Father Ted (a stuffed animal), a secretly purchased rosary, and a "stolen" cross necklace, Jussy turns her closet into her own private "confessional".   What will happen when her family finds out?  Littman humorously and compassionately shows the readers Justine's life as she struggles with her religious questions, her neat-nick mother, and, sadly, the death of her beloved grandmother.  Readers might not find out all the answers from Justine, but they will definitely know they are not alone in the mysterious world of religion.Reviewed by:  Sally Kruger, aka "Readingjunky
This is by far my favorite novel by Forster, and many rereadings have made it one of my favorite novels, period. In his first book, Forster shows a subtlety and lightness of touch which I, at least, feel that he lost as he  got more self-consciously &quot;philosophical&quot; in later books like  Howard's End and A Passage to India. He makes wonderful use of the Italian  settings and of Italian art, bringing them to vivid life, undermining  tourist cliches, and weaving them gracefully into his main themes.  No  other book I know balances romanticism and irony so perfectly
I first purchased this book when I was a freshman in college seven years ago. It is without a doubt the best and easiest reference guide to writing I have ever read.  I love the plastic tabs that mark each section.  This guide is easy to read and follow it is organized in basic steps that are categorized accourding to section.  So for example if you need to find out how to cite a web page or a video tape, etc using the MLA style you just flip to the section called doucmentation clearly marked with a plastic tab.  I have since purchased an updated guide for myself and also bought one for my brother - a freshman in college.  I really wish I had this book when I was in high school.  I highly recommend this book to any high school, college, graduate student or writer.  I especially recomend this book for students with learning disabilities, I myself have ADD and before I got this guide I could not understand how to write a paper in the MLA style or in any style other than a book report.  I promise this is the easiest reference guide to writing ever published
The first time I read this book, I was watching it all happen. i'ts like I was invisible. I admire Elizabeth for having the guts to do what she did. I would have fought back, but she did it the safe way, she didn't resist. Reading this book, you feel like you know the Smart family. I pray for all Missing Children everywhere. Elizabeth is the luckiest girl in the world! Mary Katharine was so cool and collected. she is amazing too. read this book
While this book, like its predecessor, is beautifully illustrated and a joy to read, it is the presentation of quiltmaking as a shared experience among family and friends that make both these books so special.  I loved the first so much, I had to have this one the moment it appeared and it has only served to add to my list of pending projects
This book is a celebration of color and the watercolor medium.  Turning  the pages is like watching a fabulous fireworks display.  Each page reveals  another explosion of beautiful color painting.  Like fireworks, some  paintings go off with a huge bang, and others are more muted; but each  painting has something to say -- there are no &quot;duds.&quot;  Helpful  comments by the artists give insight as to how and why each painting was  done.  If you're an artist looking for inspiration, this book can really  give you a whack in the side of the head that will send you running to your  paints.  Even if you're not an artist, you'll enjoy the gorgeous colors and  wide, wild variety of subjects and techniques.  An astonishing book and  well worth the price
I felt that the book was basically the same as the previous edition, with the exception of aromatherapy, and electric filing.  Unfortionatly no one book can give all of the information that is required about a subject.  That is what teaching is all about.  I generally supplement the material from other books, and Florida law so our students stay on the right path.  Over all I would have to say that this book was above average, and addressed many of the changes in the industry to date
The Emotionally Unavailable Man should be added to everyone's self-help library.  Ms. Henry clearly identifies and defines the problem, then prescribles manageable steps for healing.  Her energetic writing style involves the reader right from the start.  Even those who do not suffer from emotional detachment will find this book engaging.  Most may even identify loved ones who either exhibit this or who are involved with someone who exhibits this behavior.  Clearly this is a book for our times.  
Set in a German village reminiscent of Grimm's fairy tale world this book will quickly have readers under it's spell.  This tale within a tale within a tale concerns a young clockmaker,Karl, who needs to create a figure for the great clock of Glockenheim to mark the end of his apprenticeship.  Time is running out for Karl and he is fretful because has not yet made the figure. At this same time Fritz, a young storyteller is telling his latest spooky tale to the villagers.   Fritz launches in to a very mysterious tale of a prince, who it is disovered at his "death" is actually kept alive by clockworks rather than by a heart.  Also in Fritz's story is a stange man named Dr. Kalmanius.  When this highly unusual man is described by the storyteller an identical man suddenly appears. The stunned audience quickly leaves.  As the others leave this strange man  approaches Karl and presents him with the needed clock figure "springing" Fritz's tale alarmingly to life.  As always Philip Pullman creates a vibrant and engaging cast of characters who will leave an imprint on the reader's memory. The illustrations by Leonid Gore capture both the fairy tale spirit and the horror under the surface.  This is a quick but original and engaging read that will appeal to both horror and fairy tale fans.  Don't miss it
I found the first book, Faerie Wars, pretty interesting so I decided to read this one. In many ways it had excellent qualities such as suspense, mystery and a bit of romance. I'll have to admit, I finished the book pretty quickly because I got hooked onto it and didn't want to put it down. There were many twists and turns of the plot, and it was practically impossible to guess what would happen next at times.I did, however, find the ending a tad abrupt. It was such a shame to finish the book without any more information on Pyrgus, Mr. Fogarty, Henry or Blue. But overall the book was an excellent one..... it will certainly capture your interest
I had no prior experience with music playing (other than blowing some simple tunes from a harmonica) and, yet, I found thisbook to be surprisingly easy to learn from.  It smoothly and concisely guides the reader through the key elements of piano playing, starting with one-hand playing, but quickly to two-hands, then chords, etc., and ending with sharp and flat notes.  It is well organized, has well thought out exercises, advices, and a diverse collection of (short) attractive tunes of increasing complexity (from Jingle Bells to Waltzing Matilda to Silent Night to Green Sleeves to We Shall Overcome to Minuet in G Minor).  I prefer it to other teach-yourself piano books that take much longer to cover the same skills, such as The Complete Piano Player or Piano for Dummies.  I particularly like that it gets to two-hand playing almost right away, which I feel is better preparation--even if it feels hard and slows the playing initially.  It may have helped (coordination-wise) that I have been typing for 20+ years with both hands.  If you are looking for a book that teaches all the essentials of basic piano playing in a thoughtful and concise way, then I recommend this book.If you perfer a slower pace, then maybe look elsewhere.For me, this was the perfect book to learn from. 
The brilliant theory of General Theory of Relativity authored by Great Mind Albert Eintein, is truely magnificient
I started with the second volume, The Mammoth Book of More Historical Whodunnits, and enjoyed it so much that I went out and got a copy of this one as well.  I really liked the time-span of story settings, and the best part was the mystery that was written down over 2000 years ago!Great for people who like short story mysteries, and as a lead-in to authors you might like
Jesse, 15 lives in Harlem, New York City.  He is the only child of a bright couple and his best friend, Rise is one of his biggest influences.Jesse and Rise grew up together.  When Rise, 17 turns to crime and joins the Counts, a local street gang and insists on bringing Jesse in with him along with their friend C.J., Jesse starts to reassess their friendship.  He sadly realizes that he and Rise are traveling down different streets; the drive-by shooting of their friend Bobby, 14 has left the neighborhood shaken.  C.J., a musical prodigy who plays piano in their church also has his sights set on a different path.  It is C.J. and Jesse, a budding young artist who is quite talented at drawing who realize they have more in common with each other.Rise and the Counts are in for a Count-down; sadly, drive-bys claim more casualties.  The Counts were described as being on the tame end of street gangs; a warring faction called the Diablos were responsible for shooting a friend; killing a cabbie and later, some members of the Counts.Sidney, a kind and fair police officer takes the boys under his wing.  He is respected in the neighborhood and word on the street was that he was a fair man, which he was.  When Mason, 19 an older member of the Counts was busted for homicide, it was Sidney who took Rise and Jesse to the jail ("Iron City") to see the fate in store for their former friend.  More problems crop up in the neighborhood; Rise, seeing a chance to leave Harlem wants to call Jesse and the Counts together for a final goodbye.  Sadly, that goodbye really was the end.This is an excellent book that reflects the city and street culture well.  The characters are fresh, cutting edge, serious and believable.  The drawings were excellent and a bonus to this book.  Jesse, an aspiring cartoonist created two West Indian charcters, a wise man and a bird.  The bird was a metaphor for Jesse and it is through this avian character that he asks questions in his drawings that Wise answers.  Myers has written many excellent books, but I think he really outdid himself with this one
Yay--this book was fun and extremely informative.  At first, the idea of coloring at my age was a bit funny (to keep it humorous for me, I conjured up in my mind a tall, overgrown middle-aged male graduate student squeezed in a chair, hunched back looking over a desk and coloring with his set of 64 crayons).  Anyway, I digress.  As a doctoral graduate student taking a Neuroscience course--this book really helped me nail down structures of *way* too many things.  But ultimately, it helped me make the grade.  If you get the book, make sure to color in it--it really does help (not to mention a great way to relieve some stress from the day).  Otherwise, what's the use of buying a book like this--it becomes an ordinary textbook if you don't color in it.
My two boys, ages 3 and 2, both pull this book off the shelf over and over. I use it to teach the younger one new vocabulary (both in English and Spanish) and the older one to continue to practice his numbers (also in both languages), as well as colors. It's a great addition to the workbook Flip Flop Spanish, and also just for fun.., my littlest, a one-year-old girl, even looks at the pages and will sit with the boys to watch them. They're sturdy pages, full of all KINDS of things. The kind of book you find something new each time you open it. It has little lists to find items as well.
This is by far the best dictionary on the market.  Far better than Merriam-Webster's outdated and obtuse dictionary, The American Heritage Dictionary is a dictionary for the 21st century.  It is up-to-date,  informative, pleasing to look at and browse.  I would gladly pay full price  for this dictionary.  Finally, I can discard my outdate M-W dictionary.   What a joy
   The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the number one best selling book in the galaxy for many reasons. One it is slightly cheaper than others, but most important is that it has the words'Don't Panic' written in bold letters on the cover. The story of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy revolves around this remarkable book. This story strangely begins when the earth is destroyed by a Vogon construction fleet clearing the way for a hyper space express way. The last Earthman, Arthur Dent, is saved by his best friend Ford Prefect, who is actually an alien that comed from a small palnet somewhere in the vecinity of Betelgeuse. They are soon thrown out of an air lack and rescued by the Heart of Gold using the Infinate Improbability Drive. Inside they meet up with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two headed, three armed president of the galaxy, Trillian, an Earthwoman who Arthur failed to pick up and wnt with Zaphod, and Marvin, a parinoid android. This book tells of there amazing adventures throughought the galaxy. These adventures involve mice, an abandonded planet, a rather suprised sperm whale, and the number 42.   I loved this book for many reasons. One reason is that it is filled with unexpected humor. Another is that it gives a good spin on life. I could always count on this book to cheer me up. Don't just stop with this book there are many others in this series.
This was the first VI Warshawski book I ever read, and it did an excellent job of whetting my appetite for more.  I think Paretsky did an excellent job of drawing me into VI's world, which is rich with unique characters.  VI comes across as individualistic and principled, and I like how Paretsky resisted cliché temptation on several counts: the complex issue of chemical responsibility is not wrapped up in a tidy bundle by the end of the book, and there is no &quot;obligatory sex scene.&quot;  Not that sex scenes don't have their places, but I just hate it when I'm reading along and I can almost hear the agent say, &quot;Okay, author, you need to steam this up a bit right here if you want to sell this book.&quot;  In this story, VI is all business, which is a delightful change of pace
This is one of the best bathroom books i have read.  I bought it as a baby shower gift.  Not only is it funny but it has really helped  some of my girl-friends reluctant little poopers. 
I had a chance to read this book cover to cover. All I can say is &quot;absolutely outstanding&quot;, short of calling it a historical masterpiece in the field. Very rarely do I encounter an epidemiology or biostatistic textbook that reads so well. It is optimally reader friendly; the author appears to have such a talent in explaining some most sophisticated epidemiological and statistical concepts in such a simplified language. Yet he does not sacrifice the inclusion of some very advanced epidemiological and statistical concepts. New concepts such as causal graphs and instrumental variables are also included and explained beautifully. I strongly recommend this book to all early to intermediate graduate students majoring in Epidemiology. Established epidemiologists may wish to read this book to refresh and update their knowledge. I hope the author writes more textbooks with the same style
As a boy, I was fascinated by looking at all of the drawings and descriptions in this diary.  It gave me a great appreciation for life in the US in the early 1800s, and the fortitude and ingenuity of our forefathers.  I have found that the magic still holds, as I read it to each of my sons when they were about 8.  They still love the basic how-to descriptions which bring frontier construction to life
I believe this is one of the best lens for about $1000. Forget about zoom lenses even if they are L. This lens is far better than 70-200L in my opinion. It is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5. With zoom lenses you have to set to f/5.6 for better result and f/8 to match this lens. It is very well built but not excessive heavy, come with hood and bag, but unfortunately, Canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the L lenses.Combined with a Tamron 1.4X teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom L lenses at 189mm focal length. Yes I know I lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens. But I am really happy that I decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200IS to 135/2L+1.4X. This not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures, especially at wide open. Better portrait lenses, like 200/1.8 and 300/2.8, would cost several thousands of dollars. Trust me, once you play with primes, you will not like zoom anymore.I am also using a 24-70L to shoot my small kid. After using this lens, I don't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday, the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6X crop factor of digital camera. A 35mm/1.4L will become 56mm which is really not good.Order from Amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock. They shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated "in stock soon".Pros:Very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5.Very fast lens with f/2Very good bokeh (background blurring).Overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast/color.Smaller size, less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s.It is a L lens: best build quality, fast/quiet ring USM AF with FTM.Cons:No hard case.No inexpensive.Effective focal length is 216mm on 10D/20D/Rebel/300D which is a little difficult to use for portrait
I use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work.  When you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with.  Unless you are going for a very shadowy, high-contrast, image this diffuser can save the day.  It is very light weight and easy to pack in small places, so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind.  Sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo, and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences
I read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before I purchased this lens and I was not dissapointed one bit. I was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try. The macro shots were very sharp and contrasty. The center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at F2.8  Anything beyond F4 is tack sharp. Be carefull with this lens though. The DOF at F2.8 is extremely narrow. Don't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp. Focus properly and crank up the aperture and you'll get some very satisfying macro shots. The only thing I wish this lens had was image stabilizer. Canon, how about a 100mm macro with IS?
This is a great lens for star fields. It is about the least expensive lens canon makes and also one of the fastest. The focus was sharp to the corners without coma. See my photo of a portion the Milky Way. This was obtained with a 30sec exposure with a Rebel XT on an inexpensive clock drive sitting on a picnic table
My all-around favorite lens in the Canon EOS system is the 50/1.4.  I find that most of the time, most of the pictures I want to take can be achieved using hte 50mm focal length, and the fast aperture allows me to take photos in low light.I bought the 24-70/2.8 in hopes of getting high quality images from a zoom lens, as a lot of my pictures weren't in particularly dark places, and the flexibility to get a little wider or closer sounded appealing.I was not disappointed.The image quality produced by the 24-70/2.8 is outstanding.  Great color, great sharpness.  It might not make images quite as striking as Canon's 135/2 lens, but they are very good indeed.Does this lens replace the 50/1.4?  No way.  The 50 is a lot smaller, weighs a lot less, and is still much better for low light shooting.  But for photographing events where you don't want to lug around several prime lenses or go to extreme lenghts to frame the shot better, the 24-70 can be a great tool
This camera has the potential for pictures with amazing clarity and colors but not straight out of the camera. I too was disappointed after converting the RAW files with C1 Pro and ACR. Was it possible that my D-Rebel would be better than this monster that gives me neck pains and has made my right arm to start looking like Swartzenegger's arm? Even with L glass the results were dissapointing. The problem is not with the camera but with the workflow. After using it for 2 months I am getting used to a workflow that will give me the results I am looking for. I had to realize that this camera does not perform any processing enhancements in camera because the pros need to do it themselves. Once I got over the fact that I would have to sharpen and saturate colors a lot more than before I was content and have never touched the D-Rebel ever since.PS Beware of the severe neck pains when attaching any L zoom lens. Buy the hand strap or a better neck strap.Some photo samples can be found here:http://www.trekearth.com/members/nbournas/photos
The balance with the grip on is really much better.  Yes I am aware there were problems with some earlier ones, but mine seems just fine (knocking on wood as I type)
If you don't need the speed or can't afford the expensive 85mm f1.4 Nikkor lens or both, then this lens may be the right one for you. It took Nikon a while to produce a superb compact 85mm lens, but this time they finally got it right. Without a doubt, this is a fine portrait lens for photographing head-and-shoulder portraits (The only lens which is optically better is Nikon's legendary 105mm f2.5 Nikkor lens, and its close optical twin, the 105mm f2.8 Micro Nikkor.). Since the 105mm f2.5 Nikkor lens doesn't have an autofocus version, then this might be the perfect moderate telephoto lens for owners of Nikon autofocus SLR cameras. Regardless, this lens has a well-earned reputation for excellent contrast and resolution
I won the Kodak printer at a scrapbook convention & then went on the hunt to find the refills at a reasonable price. Purchasing the 160 count made the price per print the lowest & beat out anything I could find in the local stores. It is a great convenience to be able to whip out a 4x6 print instead of having to download it to a store's website, wait a few days, go there & pick it up, etc. Great value
Excellent product, easy to use, great for edging cards and making trims for cards and craftwork.  I can't wait to experiment with it
I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.  It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.  I take it with me everywhere,literally, it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable. There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!  The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).However, I do have a few things to complain about...First off, the battery.  This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.  Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.  The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.  Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!  Very wrong.  The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.  Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.The flash is very weak.  Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.  The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.  To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.  The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.These are all the flaws I found in the camera, it's not my first choice in cameras, I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.  If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice. 
It was everything it advertised as being.  I can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras.  Being a slingshot backpack, my back doesn't moan and groan as it did with other camera bags.  I like the feature of swinging the bag to the front and to get my cameras with out removing the backpack
First of all I do not consider myself anything more than a very beginning photographer !!! So I will not go into anything technical.  I will leave that to people who know more than I do. But what I am is an international traveler.  I simply got tired of coming home from fantastic trips with "snapshots".  I wanted someting much better, and boy did I get it with this camera.  I looked at the D70s and since I have very small hands, I could never feel comfortable holding it.  This camera is smaller without being small.  I have only taken photos locally, but at this time of the year with the leaves changing it makes a good start.  The built in editing features (filters etc.) are wonderful to work with.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants something more than "point and shoot" snap shots
I just bought a digital rebel about a month ago.  Love the camera, my old 380EX speedlight integrates with the camera but just doesn't offer enough cycle speed to keep up with continuous mode on the Rebel. This flash does the job for the Rebel and the plug for the external battery pack promises even better performance once I grab that item.  Another big selling point that really makes this unit worth the cash, is that it has its own infrared focus assist lamp which the digital Rebel lacks.  When this flash is mounted on your digital rebel, you don't get that annoying set of quick flashes that the camera has to set off to focus in low light when using the built-in flash.  The Rebel body uses the infrared focus assist on the 550EX to focus the lens; this feature alone is worth the big bucks this baby costs.  The flash has tons of features that most of us might never use, but as a advanced amateur I'm glad they're there so I can play with that if I should choose to try out some fancy stuff.  The wireless slave capability is handy but you've got to have at least one more 420EX, 550EX or 580EX to use that. I like the digital readout on the back of the flash and also the two way bounce head, it's important to note that you have to press a button to make the head turn either side to side or up/down---this should make the head sturdier than I've seen on some units that get loose after awhile and drive you nuts. This unit is a HONKER--really big, and, no lightweight either.  Get yourself a big deep camera bag if you want to lug this thing around with you.  What's the difference between this and the 580EX? The 580 has very slightly faster cycle times and offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes, for me anyway it wasn't worth almost two hundred dollars more for the 580. All of the newer EOS camera bodies are fully supported by this unit, it also works on older EOS bodies but there are functions available on the newer ones that aren't there on older stuff.  I like this flash it covers well, cycles fast and the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use.  When you get yours don't lose that book, Canon doesn't seem to have them online anywhere I can find and I've seen places that want to charge you 18 bucks for a new one
This camera is amazing. Out of the 3 digital camera's under $150 I've used, this is by far the best, beating out the Kodak and the SiPix. I originally bought the SiPix, and it was junk. Don't buy the SiPix that's under $150. The Kodak for some reason didn't seem like it took as good pictures as the FinePix, but the software was a little better, being from Kodak. This camera can take pictures of resolution up to 2 megapixels, but I don't even use that option because the 1 megapixel pictures are so amazing. It comes with a 16MB removable memory card, so you can take around 49 pics at 1MP, around 24 at 2MP, and it takes short videos for about 30 seconds in mpeg format at a 320 x 160 resolution, or more on a lower setting. The LCD screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power, and the 2 AA batteries it takes lasts pretty long. It has a nice, sleak design, and the software has no issues with windows XP at least. The only cons I could think of are that the only zoom it has is 2X digital zoom, which is pretty much useless, and I never use it, since it's the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer. So you can consider it not having any zoom. The software for it works well, but it could be better, options wise. The filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card, so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day (since it creates folders based on date), you'll have to rename each pic. But I hardly complain, since the pictures come out so incredibly well. I'm so happy with this camera! If you want a camera under $150, this is the one to get. Don't even waste your time with the Kodak, unless you want the one with 3X optical zoom, but that's $200. I use it for general purpose, taking pictures of freinds and such. Once in a while I take a picture of a sunset at 2MP, and that will be photo quality printed on a full page. 1MP creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images, and .3MP will created good smaller images to put on websites. There's no reason to buy anything else, go with the Fuji FinePix A200!  
Great flash, all the good qualities of the SB800 but less of the data dump and decision quagmire! It has the built in flash disperser, its lighter than the 800, so unless you're into more info than you need, go with the SB600. Oh, it has a shorter recycle time too.
Easily snaps in place and does the job.  Considerably less expensive than the local retail outlet - and delivery was quick as well
This filter is a must have for photographers that care about their gear. It remains a cost effective tool for protecting the camera lens while serving as a great every day filter.
Seems a little much to pay for an "extension cord" but upon receipt I see it is of very high quality and nice build on the connectors. Plus, its a brand item from Canon, so what can you do
My 2 year old is really active and my point and shoot camera cannot keep up with him.  And I also don't like the washout look when I uses flash.  So I researched about which SLR will best meet my needs, mainly catching fast action, candid moments and low light photos without flash.  The Canon 30D comes up top on the list.  It has the best high ISO performance in its class (better than Nikon and Sony).  And when I combine the 30D with the fast zoom lens EF-S 17-55 mm f/2.8 IS, the result is amazing.  I can stop any action in daylight, capture every candid expression of my 2 yr old with the fast burst mode, and take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod.  Portraits are also excellent with sharp image and beautifully blurred background (bokeh).  Even the dimly-lit decors of the Disneyland Haunted Mansion came out superb when we went there for the Halloween party at night, without flash or tripod.  This is really an important factor for me to buy this camera, as taking pictures with a tripod is not an option when your subject is an active 2 yr old.  But you will need a good lens to make this work well.  If you use a cheap kit lens, then it will probably not matter which camera you pick.  Remember that these 3 are all very good cameras and the small differences in image quality you see in reviews are apparent only when they use the best prime lens (not the kit lens)and crop the pictures to magnify the details.  The Sony is a very good choice if you are on a budget and don't need low light performance (use flash and save money).  The Nikon has more custom function than Canon, and it is really as good as Canon.  They both have their strength and weakness.  Canon just happens to have slightly better high ISO performance and that suits my need better than Nikon.  To be fair, I should mention that the Nikon D200 tops most reviews as the camera of the year, beating the Canon 30D overall.  But the D200 is a bit too advanced for an amateur like me, better suits someone more serious about photography.  The D80 is like a "mini" D200, but slower.  So it really boils down to what you really need and how much you want to spend.  Shooting in low light without flash will need good high ISO performance, a good fast lens (with wide aperture, usually expensive), and image stabilization.  If that's what you want, the Canon 30D with the EF-S 17-55 mm f/2.8 IS will not disappoint you
I don't have that much stuff, but fits all my DSLR gadgets plus my camcorder.Fits - my Canon Xti with my canon 50 mm attached.- my kit lens- my new canon 70-300 IS- my panasonic video cam- minor accessories (extra batteries, cables, memory cards, etc)There are separators with velcros inside, so you can configure the bag however you want it.The only issue I have with this bag is that I wan't able to configure it to store my Xti with my 70-300 attached
"Wow!" is all I can say to express my reaction after getting prints taken with my 17-40.  I've been using Nikon manual-focus Nikkors since 1988 and was always satisfied with the color and sharpness.  However, after using the Canon "L" series, I've sold a lot of my Nikkors.  The color, clarity, sharpness, and detail of the "L" lenses are amazing.  The prints have this 3-D effect (without having to use those silly red/blue glasses!) 8-)  Within 3 weeks of receiving my 17-40, I ordered the 70-200.  Those two lenses will replace my whole Nikkor collection.  Build is really good.  The "L" zooms are a little bulkier, but very managable.  The Nikkors are smaller, but very heavy.  But lense technology and coatings have improved so much in 20 years, I can see the difference.  I tested the lens by pointing it toward the sun.  The 17-40 surprising handles flare very well.  With the sun just outside the field of view, there was very little flare and loss of contrast.  I also make 12x18 prints, and this lens handles them easily.  The body is going to be the limiting factor (refering to digital bodies).Warning: once you use "L" glass, you are going to be spoiled.  You may not settle for consumer lenses anymore, although some non-L lenses are quick good from what I read
From a pure image quality standpoint, this lens will not please the pixel peepers.  On the wide end of the zoom, which I personally use more often than the telephoto end, this lens is not very sharp, and it suffers from fairly bad distortion.  Worse than that, for me, are the chromatic abberations; this lens is quite prone to significant CA when shot at the wide end, which can look a lot worse than a little bit of distortion or softness.  Given the price of this lens, one should expect a higher level of optical performance.The maximum aperture of this lens is not very large, being f/4 on the wide end, and f/5.6 on the telephoto end.  The image stabilization makes up for this some, as you can comfortably shoot at much slower shutter speeds than otherwise, but, let's be honest here; this lens is a poor performer if you want to shoot in low light with no tripod.  The small aperture makes for a dark viewfinder, which can be a very big problem if you are trying to compose a picture in the dark (using a tripod).Yet, I still gave this very imperfect lens four stars, and this is not without reason.First of all, the focal length range is quite handy.  It isn't a mega-zoom that does everything, however, it covers the most often used focal length ranges, and is an appropriate lens to use for the vast majority of situations.  The little bit of extra zoom on the telephoto end is handy on occasion, and it's also worth noting that the lens sharpens up quite a bit when you zoom in some - it might be soft on the wide end, but zoomed in, it's quite good.I have printed as large as 20x30" using this lens on a Digital Rebel, and have no qualms with the results.  Yes, there are sharper lenses out there, but you are a lot more likely to see the difference in sharpness on your computer monitor than in a print.This lens has ring USM, which enables it to focus very quietly, and very quickly, whereas the slightly cheaper (and F2.8) options from the 3rd parties have normal focusing motors that are slow and noisy by comparison.If you want to use this lens indoors, you are best off getting a flash to go with it, such as a 430EX.  The lens is usable in fantastic indoor lighting, or during the day, but won't give you good results in low light with no flash.  If you will be shooting in lower light situations (people in particular), Tamron and Sigma have some good options in the 17-50mm range with F2.8 apertures, and I would recommend those lenses over this one.  If you'd prefer the extra telephoto range, the image stabilization so you can shoot with smaller aperture in poorer lighting situations for greater depth of field (instead of needing to shoot a landscape at f/4, for instance, without image stabilization, you could use f/11 on this lens, and get a sharp picture with better depth of field.  This is even more useful in the close focus range - while this isn't a true macro lens, if you take closeup photos without a tripod, you will want to stop the lens down for greater depth of field, and the IS helps with that quite a bit.Overall, I've been fairly pleased with the performance of this lens.  If you like to worry about splitting hairs, and zooming all the way in on pictures on your computer, this lens is likely to dissapoint you.  If, however, you are willing to sacrifice optical perfection to get a very well rounded, useful lens, then I'd recommend it, however, would also recommend that you consider the 3rd party options, as they are also great lenses, and do offer a somewhat better value
If you're looking for a high-quality telephoto zoom lens that is fast enough to use indoors, you may have found what you're looking for.  The 70-200/2.8 lens produces beautiful results that are overall on par with the 135/2 prime lens (although not quite as sharp).The main downside to this lens is that it's big and heavy.  I don't mind carrying it around my neck on the camera so much, but when you go to use if you have to put extra effort into keeping the lens from shaking in your hands due to the weight.  And it's not exactly the sort of lens that I would want to toss into my backpack, just due to the immense size.If you don't mind spending an extra $500, consider also the 70-200/2.8 IS (image stabilization) version of this lens.  It weighs even more, but the built in IS unit should help compensate for shaky hands whilst using the lens
Not knowing fully what I was getting into, on a whim I purchased this monopod hoping that is was a half-way decent product, I mean-it was so cheap.  I was pleasantly surprised to find how sturdy the unit was and that what I had was a very high quality monopod.  This was my second monopod and so I had another to compare it with (the other was bought on an auction website).  In comparison the Opteka was a far better monopod in height and robust thickness and I use it exclusively on my miniDV shoots
I bought this lens a little over a year ago for macro shooting.  I quickly found out, however, that to shoot Macro-only with this lens is a crime.  It is a very versitile lens.  Its fast f/2.8 aperture makes for good shooting in low light.  I pretty much use this outdoors as the 100mm with the 1.6x crop factor of my Rebel XT eliminates most indoor oppurtunities.I frequently use this lens for family portraits, the resultant photo is so crisp and clear and the bokeh really helps add snap to the primary subject.As others have stated, this is a heavy lens.  It doesn't have Image Stabilization (IS) so a tripod or monopod is a great accessory to get the best images.  I use a beefy monopod for my best shots, although I have a lot of handheld gems...If you are tight for cash, this isn't the "one lens" that does it all.  If you are looking for a versitile lens that can do outstanding macros and portraits, THIS is that lens.
This is an excellent device. Quick respond with my D80.I use it to take the family pictures that include me.I just point and press this remote to activate the D80's timer and It works beautifully
This camera has been called a "pro-sumer" model and you should really take that title seriously. The quality of the pictures that it takes are just as good as a professional digital camera of the same resolution. The trade off is that it is really not happy being thrown in a bag (or big pocket, if it fits). Why? Because Canon have given it a really annoying power-on switch that is guaranteed to turn the camera on 90% of the time when you're moving it to or from a bag. To compound this problem, the lens extends (in your bag), pushing off the lens cap and leaving it open for possible damage. So, if you think of this as a professional camera, to be kept in a real camera-case, you'll probably be okay. If you're somebody, like me, who likes to throw his camera in a bag or pocket, you're going to be annoyed by the power switch. That said, I do LOVE the quality of the pictures and all control that the camera gives you over every aspect of taking them.CONS: stupid power-on switch that always catches and turns camera on; lens cap is kind of loose and falls off easily; widest angle is maybe a little too telephoto still (around 35mm?)PROS: awesome pictures; tons of controls all over the outside of the camera allowing you to control a lot without having to resort to menus; professional features including flash hot-shoe and replaceable lens; great battery life; awesome picture
 At a recent NYE event, I shot a lot of photos in a concert setting without a flash and am very impressed with the sharpness & clarity of this lens performance. Its so fast and the colors are vibrant. I am not a seasoned pro but with the 20D and this lens, it makes me look pretty close. I did shoot in manual and once I got my aperture & shutter speed dialed in, it pumped out a lot of great pics. I have also shot some pics of waterfalls (slowing down my shutter speed to get that soft flowing image) and portraits of people and again, it oozed excellence. The 135mm focal range is not as convenient as a zoom, but the quality of this prime lens makes up for any incovenience
I've had this battery for 3 months. So I don't have long term experience. But so far it's been excellent. No better or worse then the original canon battery. I would reccomend it to anyone.
It's a 72mm lens hood, no vigneting, works great. A must for using EF28-135 outdoors
I have used this lens for over 6 months now and have over 1k shots through it.  It is as fantastic as others note herein.  The 2.8 through the focus range is really great.  Superb.  The VR function is really a neat trick.  It is super fun to play with.The drawbacks are size and weight.  After a 1/2 hour of shooting, your arms will get tired.  Remember to be careful and hold the lens and not the camera.  This lens is definately heavy enough to bend/warp the camera body
the cover over the lense broke/small lcd screen/ pictures are pritty good/battery life is pritty good/some images can come out a bit blurry if theres no flash and your hands arnt that steady/takes nice portaits/ easy to use/ has a veiw-finder
Canon makes a great underwater housing for a reasonable price.  I purchased this for a recent trip to Grand Cayman and Cozumel.  I didn't go Scuba diving on this trip, but I did take the camera snorkeling (diving to depths ~20ft).  It worked flawlessly and I got some pictures I was very happy with!  One thing I did not anticipate was the use the camera got out of the water.  Going from AC to the hot humid outdoors, my EOS rebel fogged up (condensation) and even after 30 minutes I couldn't take good pictures.  With the SD110 in the UW housing, I just wipped the housing's glass portal with a lens tissue after it had warmed up a couple of minutes and I was able to take clear pictures. The instructions are pretty good, but it took me a while to figure out how to take out the O-ring seal for cleaning/lubing.  Once I figured it out, it wasn't so hard.The SD110 may be getting a little old, but it still takes decent pictures and even with the housing I don't have so much money tied up in the system that I would be devestated if it was lost or stolen.  I will probably upgrade to the SD550 or SD500 (they both use the same batteries as the SD110) with the WP-DC80 or WP-DC70 housing at some time in the near future, but I will definitely keep the SD110 and WP-DC10 as backups
Photos were excellent. But photo print quality depends very much on the print shop. For the same photo file, it can look like a 4M photo when taken to a below quality printer shop. Photos taken indoor with marginal lighting (no flash used) turned out to be yellowish. Battery life is very long despite its large 3" LCD. Battery charging time is over 3 hours - too long. Photos files viewed on computer looks just great. 8'x10' prints are great but have not tried larger prints. Touch screeen control is a delight and very easy to choose and set. Date on photo is red (would be better if it is black). And the location of the date is not at the far right hand corner
The quality is definitely great. When attached to the S3 IS, it makes your camera look serious about taking good shots. If you are attaching the hood and doing flash photography, I suggest you use a slave flash to eliminate the shadow caused by the hood
I honestly don't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars. The moment I got it, I was delighted with the quality of the pictures (except in very dark places - which is why the review gets minus 1 star), and by its portability.I've dropped it, abused it, took it to countless parties, countries and it is now FULL of scratches and bumps (GET THE CAMERA CASE!), and guess what: it still works as perfectly as the first day I got it. This little piece of technology is amazing, so if you're looking for something affordable and with a great picture quality (for us amateurs, of course) just go for it. ACtually, I even took quite a few gorgeous pictures with it. I even love it and rely on it so much that I won't change it even now that it looks all messed up.Don't think twice. Just go for it
The battery is great, but Amazon offers the accessory kit with the same battery, plus a mini-dv tape and a carrying case for the same price.  The case is useless for the ZR series, but might come in handy for some other purpose
I received the XACTi a few weeks ago and it's performing like I hoped it would.  The controls are a very simple and intuitive.  All the required hardware is included.  Does not require any additional software to run on Mac or Windows.I have a MacBook with Boot Camp running Windows XP Pro.  The camera works easily with either platform.  It is recognized as another drive and does not require any additional software to download the images and movies onto the hardrive.  I am using a SanDisk 2gb SD memory card.Another big plus is not having to wait while downloading real-time like you would have to with miniDV.  The quality may not be the same as miniDV but the convenience and ease of use make up for the difference.  The quality is much better than a digital camera when taking movies and people will think it's just a camera by it's small size.My old camera was a 2 mega pixel Canon Powershot A60.  This is rated at 6 mega pixel.  You can definitely see the difference in the pictures and movies.  When filming movies, the higher frames per second sample rate makes the images smooth, even when taking pictures of high speed objects like helicopter rotor blades and airplane propellers.This is my first camcorder so I can't really compare to anything else (except my old camera) but the ease of use will make you want to use it all the time and people will start to tell you to put that thing away
I just bought this waterproof case in order to use my Canon s410 on a scuba diving trip.  I was a little nervous at first (I could see me scrapping the camera after it got soaked to the bone!), but I have to say that the waterproof case performed admirably!  I used it on 6 dives, and all of them were to depths of 80+ feet.  I did not have one leak!  A word of caution--I followed instructions and coated the seal of the camera with a fine coat of silicon gel (just a small amount).  I would like to think that the camera would not leak without this, but I did not want to take any chances.I would recommend this case to anyone who wants to use their Canon camera on dive trips or excursions at the beach
We canoe/kayak down various rivers and creeks.  I wanted a way to take my $1500 camera on the water without fear of damaging it.  The Sports Pack is completely water proof (up to 7m).  I've submersed the case in a test and in a real-life situation and the camera stayed dry.  The case does not cause any noticeable reduction in picture quality. It is relatively simple to operate and assemble. You have only the basic functions of the camera while in the case, so you need to change any setting for the camera before putting it in the case and advanced camera features are not able to be used.My only concern is the scratch resistance of the plastic over the lens area.  So far I haven't had any problems but I've only taken on the river for about 30 hrs.All told, I'm very pleased and if you plan on filming in or near water I would recommend this case
The camera fits perfectly. The case is very stylish.  Best of all, its Pink
I bought this camera to take pictures of my family and friends. I have had if for more than one year, and it has performed above expectations under all conditions. The 1 minute video feature is great, and was an unexpected bonus (since I didn't know about it when I bought it off Amazon). The camera works great with iPhoto and MacOS X. I bought a 512 MB card for it and so far it has been great. Both my father and my father in law have the previous Powershot S400 and they have had no problems with it. I figure at some point I'll have to change the battery, because Lithium-Ions lose 20% capacity per year, but so far it has worked flawlessly.
I bought this item for a present, and the person REALLY liked it!!. He uses it to watch deer, and other animals. The focus is very good, and I am very happy that I bought this product!
We had a Canon Powershot S50 3 years ago, loved it. So this time when my husband wanted to buy another digital compact camera, we specifically looked for Canons. We originally were thinking of getting the SD700,800 or something like that. But after we compared these cameras together in a store near us. We found out SD900 has the finest LCD display, more opitions in control panel... So we came back and bought it from Amazon (our favorite online store). We used it in our last trip to Grand Cayon, LV, SF etc. This SD900 takes very good pictures, especially in good lighting conditions. Colors are also smooth and rich. The downside, as you may already read from others' reviews, no battery indication, no raw(it's ok, my husband doesn't do much editiing anyway, it will be too much to ask for a campact camera to offer), control panel is sensitive... don't get frustrated if you happened to pressed the wrong button and couldn't figure the way out during the time of shooting. Stich is a great function which comes with, but when in a very bright area, you can not see the stich alignment very well on the LCD screen (I guess it's a common trouble to all digital compact cameras which are relay on LCD dispay).Overall, it's a wonderful camera, we love it. It's my husband's camera, I uses Canon 350D, but I borrow it from my husband sometimes because it's tiny compares to my 10 lbs "moose" and it takes very good pictures.
With these weights I was able to send my Canon Powershot S70 to the bottom of the Atlantic, and I have great faith that they will keep it there.  Reliable, and more professional than a brick
I bought my K10D in Dec 06 after owning a number of Pentax cameras over the years and being very pleased with the engineering. The combination of features, if executed properly, make this camera the best buy in 10MP DSLRs right now.  I postponed my review because I wanted to get some real field experience.  I just went to Mexico, and panicked because I left the camera instruction manual behind.  I can now report on that trip. I did a little fumbling at first, mainly because I didn't have the manual, but I was soon able to find the combinations I wanted, and the camera performed both flexibly and intuitively.  The AF button and the exposure compensation button are very well placed.  I found myself in difficult lighting situations often, and both AF and exposure metering worked quite well.  I also took some hand-held shots that I normally would use a tripod with (such as at 450mm), and very few came out fuzzy because of camera movement.  In a few cases, I used bracketing, and was easily able to obtain a good balance of details in one or more of the bracketed shots.  Exposure metering worked so well that I stopped bracketing.  I particularly liked the display modes: I could boost the brightness to see the display even in bright daylight, and deep zooming gave me a good check of whether a shot was "soft" or not right at the scene.  The rechargeable Li Ion batteries, although not readily available in stores, seem to last forever (even using power zoom, and full-bright display, and some fill flash).  I believe that I could have shot all week (700 shots in RAW (DNG) + JPEG) with the battery grip attached. In summary, this camera was a pleasure to hold, very easy to use and manipulate, and resulted in a high percentage of crisp photos (even if the percentage of well-composed shots was lower because of the photographer).  I bought it because of its compatibility with Pentax lenses, 10MP sensor, shake-reduction technology, larger display, and especially the dust and water seals.  But what makes me quite happy about it is its overall ease of use and good results.  I am still discovering its features, but I already know that this camera frees me to be creative in ways that other cameras have not in the past.  Some of the features on this camera are unique (new program lines) and some are available only on cameras costing several hundred dollars more, making the K10D a good choice and a best buy.  Once again for Pentax, the engineering is supurb.  
With most of the carrying case made of either fake leather or some kind of neoprene material, this one is really different.  The rigid structure also seem to do a great job to protect the camera.  There is also a belt loop and D-ring feature which is great.
kodak door strains to shut with this battery. nice idea but, too bad for kodak owners. i have great success though with energizer lithium batteries. they last me a long time and fit perfectly
I have enjoyed using my camera. I have been able to get some great pictures. The stabilization feature work well
I got this bag for under $15 and it is worth every penny. It fits my Canon ZR850 and accessories. It looks nice and it seems to be a great quality.
The battery works as specified, the pricing was excellent and the order came in very timely. I'm completely satisfied with this product and vendor
I purchase this on december 2006 i have other 10X50 binocular but when i look at sky through this binox..it's amazing!!! i recommend it for astronomy and birding trip..
Very compact, light and easy to hold - full marks for design. Buttons etc can take a bit of getting used to, but ok once mastered. Main downside for me it only takes DVD-R/RW- and not DVD-R/RW+, bit of a problem when you pick up the wrong ones! Also, can be a problem taking it abroad - I had issues charging it as it would take a standard US to UK converter plug as the pins are slightly wider than normal US plugs.
our firm uses our PowerShotSD500 camera daily and often takes long videos of our work for our clients and material processing. long battery life is very important. we have over a dozen of the Canon batteries. Pleased with them all. 
The case is protective and stylish without hindering the camera's ability to store and transport easily.  It's definately worth the dough to keep your Nikon S1 or S2 from scratching or even breaking from a minor fall
I have the Sony battery that came with the camera and bought an additional Sony battery that allowed for 2-4 hours. However, I wanted a battery that I could count on for the better part of an "all day" event and I found it in the QM91D.  I was asked to photograph a wedding from getting ready (hair dresser at 0830, until the end of the reception at 11:30pm) The QM91D held strong.  I did not constantly video tape, but with my digital recorder I had 6 sony 120 tapes (60 min digital) -- 5 were captured using the QM91D.  I did switch some of the tapes before they were completely used to make sure I didn't miss important events ... so I never actually used up "all" of the QM91D battery.This battery was used again during the evacuation from Houston (secondary to Hurricane Rita) -- I used it entirely and it did not faulter ... it lasted throughout the trip and I had no need to change to the smaller batteries.  The size of the battery did not really bother me -- I was aware that it would be larger than the others and it did not hamper the use of the camera.Read the manufacturer information on battery life, charging time etc ... for this battery it is valid.  I would recommend this battery.
After reading dozens of reviews for both this case and the PSC-55, I was still undecided on a case for my Canon SD630.  So, I purchased both to see for myself which one would work.  Because red is my favorite color, I really wanted the red case to fit (PSC-90).  The camera will fit in the case, but it's a VERY tight fit.  I had to shove the camera in the case to make the snap close.  The PSC-55 is still a very snug fit, but allows for some extra breathing room which I feel is better for the safety of the camera.In addition, here's something to consider if you're deciding between the two cases: the inside lining of the PSC-90 is more of a rigid nylon material, while the lining of the PSC-55 is a softer felt material.  The case overall is still rigid, but I like the thought of my camera resting against a softer lining.  Based on that alone, I'm going with the PSC-55 - I feel that this will be more friendly to the 3" screen on the SD630.Both cases are a very nice leather and are very attractive - I'm pleased with the Canon brand
I fried my charger in Mexico and needed to replace it. This was the exact replica and it works great
   I got this cam as a gift and it is very nice and sleek and easy to use!   The pictures are nice and it is light and easy to have it with you   everywhere
You won't go wrong with a Panasonic DV. I've had a few models. I have several of this model for my business. They're rock solid reliable, nice and small for portability, and the quality of the recording is very goo
Solid construction, good optics, nice sound.  As mentioned by others, the output for the USB transfer is found in the handycam console and not the camera itself...a minor annoyance.  All in all, this is a good camera that is touch pricy but you do get what you pay for....
I have a Canon EOS Rebel which takes fantastic pictures.  I use it around home and when I am setting up static shots such as family portraits.  The only problem is...who wants to lug it around to take snapshots.Despite some of the above opinions about lack of sharpness, I have had no such problems.  The 5900 is great for "grab" shots and it's not too shabby for setting up a planned shot using it's advanced controls. Be sure that you buy a FAST memory card.  This will reduce the time between shots.  As in most cameras, a memory card is not supplied with the camera.  Mr. Goyal's review about not being able to take pictures without a memory card is not true.  You can take a LIMITED number of shots with the internal memeory. The only real problem I have is the red-eye reduction feature.  I usually turn it off as the delay between the "red-eye" flash and the main flash is too long.  The subjects often think the shot is over and start to move.  Anyway it is easy enough to remove it later, either with photo-software or with the photo kisok in the drug store
I purchased the videocamera thinking I could watch my old tapes also.  This videocam does not do that.  I had to return it
Bought these binoculars for my husband. He loves them. They are very powerful and he loves the way they feel - not too heavy. He can look at stuff across the creek and is amazed at the clarity in the things that he sees
I stumbled across this little gem by accident.  I was picking up supplies at Office Depot and they had a Kodak Z650 (display model) on sale for under $100. It was a ridiculous impulse buy--I already own 4 digital cameras ... the last thing I needed was another camera! But what a delighful suprise this camera turned out to be! It's come the closest to rivaling the image quality of my old Olympus C-740. I had never seriously looked at Kodak cameras ... I always steered clear of them based on bad press and negative comments about them from my friends who are "serious" photographers. But I couldn't be happier with this little bargain ... it basically serves the need I wanted to fill -- a 6mp camera that takes the kind of quality shots I was used to with my C-740.There are a few negatives in that it can be a little slow in processing the shots, but there is very little shutter-lag when taking the shots. I've gotten some amazing birds-in-flight shots with it--something I've never been able to accomplish with any of my other cameras, including the C-740. Some low-contrast shots come out a bit noisy, but for the most part the shots are very crisp and sharp. It handles low-light settings better than any of the others in this class that I've tried. At less than a third of the price of my Canon S2-IS, this little camera outclasses the others by a mile.I stumbled on to a good find in the Z650 ... it's not going to give you DLSR quality photos, but no point-and-shoot will.  This camera is perfect for any one who likes to take great outdoor and wildlife shots.  I just wish someone would have given a good report on Kodak cameras before I spent a small fortune on the others
We love this camera.  It's small, easy to use, has a big LCD screen and takes great pictures.  Fuji has always been a great product and this one is no exception
purchased as a gift and well received.  seems to handle larger chips in a timely manner.  runs everyday, all day and no problems encountered.  displays vacation pictures clearly.  like that it is big enough to view across the room.  frame is more compatible with decore than the 7" model previously purchased
I am pleased with the purchase.  Very good value.  Picture quality is good and it is easy to operate.  Only negative is that it was advertised as wood frame when in fact it is plastic.  However, it looks good.  This is my second purchase of this product: one for myself and one as a gift
I am really enthusiastic about this lens because it is an excellent accessory for my camera at a very convenient price.  I add it and use it for landscapes, mountain views, nature images and such, and also for group pictures in family photos.   It does what is supposed to do: it increases the field of view while keeping the whole image very clear, and in this way the pictures appear more natural -- a whole view and not a narrow frame -- with perspective and deepness also, quite similar it seems to me to what I see with my own eyes.   A very useful additional tool
I am very satisfied with this purchase.  It is exactly what I wanted.  I purchased 5 more as business gifts for important clients
I've had a ton of these, and I take them on camping trips with kids where the main activity is playing in big mud fields.  I've had them in my pocket while rolling around in the mud, taken it out, shot a few pics, put it back in the pocket with no problem.  (See pictures for examples of "mud photos")A couple of times I've had them stand up to so much moisture and abuse that the cardboard falls off, but still had beautiful pictures every time, no jams or over-exposures.  I've found the two pack at WalMart on sale for $8.99 a couple of times, and you absolutely cannot be that deal. This is my favorite disposable camera, and I've tried them all.
Combine the high ISO, low noise and fast shutter speed for great blur free shots on low light AND MOVING SUBJECTS. This is what only Fuji can offer to you on compact camera class.The F31fd doesn't have IS (Image stabilized lenses or a CCD shift sensor), which other cameras use to reduce the effect of blur from camera shaking. But this kind of stabilization is really only useful for 6x or more zoom, for just 3x typical zoom on ultra compact P&S you just need to hold it firmly and will get the same results.IS also can't prevent blur from moving subjects. With a High ISO like on F31fd you can use faster shutter speeds that will freeze subjects and prevent blur from camera shaking too. Fuji Super CCD sensor provides the lowest noise on High ISO you will find on 2007's compact cameras, the quality is only comparable to the big DSLR professional cameras.Ah, and the Face Detection is not just a gimmick or marketing appeal... it's really great, specially if someone who doesn't know how to focus on the face then recompose the scene is taking pictures of you, with F31fd they will not miss the shot
I agree with many of the reviewers--in the mid range and wide angle the lens is superb, but it is not quite as sharp as a tele--as one of the reviewers said--it does many things, and not all of them perfectly--the lens is a compromise, but an excellent compromise--the VR is an added boost--I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or send it back, because of the weakness in the tele-- but there is nothing else that can replace its versatility.--I don't want to keep changing lenses
I purchased this camera 2 weeks ago.I love using it.It has lots of function to play with. It is easy to use.I didnt have trouble taking good pictures in zoom mode outdoor.Indoor, I had to use tripod if i use zoom.However, i cant really think of any occasion that i have to use zoom indoor other than my testing last week.Besides, it gives great pictures and I loved the price. I kind of considered DSLR camera but I gave it up becasue lenses were more expensive than camera itself. I considered one wide angle lense and one zoom lense. It would have cost me almost 2000 dollarsSo far, I love this camera.If this helps to anyone considering buying this camera, Id give two thumbs up.
Not only is this beauty wide, I have found the lens is very sharp to on my D200! It is built solid and focus's fast, and I don't have any problem with distortion because I use DXO Optics software and it cleans it up automaticly! Buy this lens, it is cheap for what you get
Took some nice pictures underwater in Cuba. Pretty easy to use. Worked fine at our depth (~8 meters, 24 feet). Still waiting for the chance to use it at greater depths.
Works better than I could have hoped.  I have used it for about a month and it is very simple to execute -- but you have to be able to hold somewhat steady which is not a problem for me.  If you are someone who has the shakes -- may be a problem.  I have compared the accuracy to gps devices with guys playing with me.  This is better since it gives you the actual yardage to the pin.  Also, you can get yardage to another golfer in the field, and yardage to any object, bunker, tree etc., which the gps can't.     A lot of courses are not marked correctly, and, of course, yardage changes depending on how far off to the side of the fairway -- or even out of the fairway -- you are.  This is where it is especially nice.  There are times when without this device you are just flat out guessing.   This is an awesome piece of technology.  It was well worth the price for me.         
I bought this as a present for my wife.  I was looking for something that she could carry in her purse.  the automatic functions are easy and functional.  It is not an enthusiasts camera:  too hard to get into the menus.  The screen is easy to turn off(this sucks battery power).  and it even has an optical viewfinder(a rare finding lately)  the optical viewfinder helps to get steady pictures for those of us with the shakes.  The pictures are clear and the colors are excellent.  The drawback is the that sony batteries cost an arm and a leg.  The wire for downloading pix is multifunctional and very proprietary(read that as expensive if you lose it
I have had this camera for about six months and I still find new features to play with. One of my favorite mode is the sequence shots. I love its sleek design and its durable shell. I carry the camera in my back pocket, even in my tightest jeans. This is a great camera
I'm like most people with a digital camera. I take a bazillion pictures, develop 10% onto paper, and then banish the other 90% to computer storage archives. I mean, I'd love to display a lot more of those pictures from my computer, but who has the wall space or time to organize all of those prints? That's why I decided to get a digital picture frame. I had been looking for quite some time, but was always turned off by the small-ish LCD sizes or poor resolutions. Then I came across this Coby 10" widescreen unit, with the 800x480 pixel display! There were no reviews on Amazon (at the time), but spec-wise it had what I wanted; a larger display and higher resolution.I took the chance and ordered one and am I glad I did! The display is huge, and the pictures look crisp. Colors are pretty accurate when compared to that of my calibrated LCD computer monitor. The interchangeable frames (it comes with a black one as well as the white one) make it easy to match with your décor. The litte remote is easy to use, but easy to lose as well, so make sure you place it somewhere easy to find. The built-in MP3 player is a nice touch. The speakers aren't that great (it is a picture frame after all), but it's nice to have the frame play music while in slideshow mode. There is a variety of transition effects to choose from. I haven't tried playing videos on it, so I can't comment on that feature.That being said, there are a few things that prevent me from giving this 5 stars.1. The adjustable stand is made of cheap feeling plastic. I've seen other frames that have much nicer backs. Yes, I know it's the front you are looking at, but the stand should be sturdier, in my opinion.2. The angle of the stand, while adjustable, is simply held in place by friction. It actually has one setting that it can click into, but then it is angled too much to view at a normal position.3. There seems to be a software bug that causes the display to act weird in slideshow mode. Well, to be more precise, if you are in slideshow mode and you choose either the Fade, Mask, or Cross Comb transition effects, then the very top horizontal pixel line starts to show black sections. It looks like dead pixels, but once you exit the slideshow (or use other effects other than then ones I listed) everything is fine. I have recreated this problem, but I don't know if it's just my frame or all of these. No biggie. I now use no transition effects it is perfect.4. This is not really a complaint about the product but more about Coby's specs. On their website they state the LCD is 800x480. Great! So I ordered the frame and then resized a whole bunch of pictures to that resolution. However, when I got the frame and started using it, I noticed that all of my pictures had black (blank) bars on both the left and right sides of the picture. It turns out that the resolution is actually 860x480 (which I found out after some trial-and-error). It would have been nice to know this ahead of time to save me from having to re-resize my pictures. Plus, sizing pictures to 860x480 is a really weird ratio... kinda like getting 4x7 prints.I ordered this from Total Electronics (one of the Amazon vendors) and it arrived quickly. When I reported the "dead pixel" problem (which turned out to be a software bug, not a defect, so to speak), they responded to my email quickly and offered to take it back no questions asked. Now that's customer service!Overall, I am very pleased with this product. In reality, it rates 4.5 stars. I'm the type of person that agonizes over something before finally buying it. With this purchase, that was totally unncessary!
This camera is an exelent camara. It has plenty of effects, plenty of modes, plenty of scenery options. The image quality is 3.2 megapixel, but its quite good. The pictures you take without the flash do end up getting a bit blury, where as if you take it with the flash, it comes out exelent. And sometimes it takes a long time for the picture to get taken with out the flash, and sometimes it happens imediatly. But all these flaws are only with my version.But if you are looking for a good camera with a great price, this is your best option
My Sony FX1 has great low light capability, 3 lux, but eventually you WILL need extra light. Using your software to lighten dark shots will likely reveal some degree of graininess, no matter which camera you use.I'm so glad I bought it.  Used it for my birthday party. Though the overhead light was good, dark corners of the room require more light. If you consider yourself advanced, semi-pro, or a pro videographer, you MUST HAVE a light.My only major beef is it runs at either 10 or 20 watts. No variable for 5, or 15.  It is worth getting a long life battery like the NP-970. Independent power source (battery) is a plus. But no outlet plug adaptor that I know of
I like that the protection filter is threaded so you can screw a conversion lens right over it, rather than having to use one or the other
Bought this tripod to use with my spotting scope for target shooting. Easy attachment to my scope and multiple adjustment heights, with the crank, make it easy to zero in on the target and allow anyone to see thru the scope, no matter how tall they are. Compact and lite to carry, makes it easy to transport to and from the range
I bought two, one for me, one for my daughter.It is compact, user-friendly, it has nice sized screen.It comes with a charger (I've been told that some don't).6.2 mgp. Video WITH audio.All this for a very nice price
I have had mine for over a year, I *love* this camera! It is so easy to use, takes great pictures, is very easy to use and program etc...I love everything about this camera. ps: unlike the other poster, I have not had any battery problems at all
The enclosure has a solid feel to it.  I dove with it three times with no problem at all. It would be nice if the weight does not cost extra.  The only compliant I have is that the enclosure is a tight fit, so it is very difficult to fit a desiccant into the enclosure
This is a camera that is very very easy to use. I was amazed by the colour quality even at a very low light. I took a movie at my nephew's theater play and I am the contrasts and crispness of the picture are just perfect. The zoom is also very clear and crisp. Putting it onto my iMovie was also a piece of cake. The only down point is that the still image mode is worthless, but if you need that you should buy the next level up which has a memory card slot.I highly recommend this camer
I dropped the camera from 2 feet and the metal outer rim of the lens slightly became bent and won't close. After some time spent tring to bend the metal back in place, I finally was able to close the lens. Besides that, it is an awesome camera. I am able to pick out a color (ex. red) and take a picture with that color standing out and everything else black and white. No photoshop needed
I purchased this camera to use with my previous church's media ministry, based on my trial use of the VX2000.  That was three years ago.  This camera is STILL running as well as it did when I bought it. I use it upwards of 3 times a week to create content for web and DVD production, plus, I get great digital audio recordings when I plug directly into my current church's sound system.  The ability to tweak audio and video input on the fly is incredible.  Now that I am creating a multimedia team for our church, I've convinced the church to buy one for themselves
The part is definitely up to Nikon's awesome standards.  I bought it for future use, as I don't currently have the lens yet,  but when the price becomes affordable I will purchase it too
My printer fits perfectly, with plenty of room for the paper tray, extra paper and a few other things that I have managed to get in also. I love this bag....Thank
This cable came in a cheap packing and it does not have any logo on it so you can't say which company it belongs to. I have used a lot of sony products and I feel it is not up to the standard of sony. It works great had no problems so far. It is flexible kinds so you don't have to worry about positioning your laptop according to your TV.
I don't think anybody is going to pretend that the little Casio Exilim EX-Z600 6.0 mega pixel camera is the best camera ever built or takes the best pictures in the world.  But for under $[...], it's hard to beat and does everything advertised.The size is perfect, one of the smallest, slimmest cameras made, easily fitting into one's [...] pocket, even when enclosed in a small case.  The viewing screen is probably the biggest and brightest you'll find, so aiming and shooting is easy as it can be.  The range of modifications (size, contrast, sharpness, saturation, etc.) to taking and managing pictures seems almost endless, yet the various menus the camera offers are simple to navigate.  And the camera's docking stand makes downloading pictures to one's computer as well as charging up the camera a snap.  Moreover, according to Casio, a single charge will afford one up to 500 or more snaps.Picture quality?  It's perhaps not as absolutely clear and well defined, even at its maximum six mega pixels, as the best cameras; although, to be fair, the best cameras often cost three-to-four times as much as this one.  So, as far as I'm concerned, I've no complaints, and the pictures I've been taking are a delight to the eye.  The Z600 makes picture-taking fun again
Celestron's tool is easy to carry, easy to use, and (at least in my case!) gives me quick, precision collimation with my Newtonian.  Why pay for a laser collimator (which needs to be calibrated) when you can use this?Collimation is the most important part of your setup; without good mirror alignment, all you'll see are blobs and blurs even on the best viewing nights.  This combination tool makes aligning both primary and secondary mirrors fairly painless, and also fairly fast.  Highly recommended for any level of observer
I liked this lens. I used it, for the first time, while traveling through Peru. It was light-weight and easy to use. At 200mm, most of my pictures turned out great, especially when I was on steady ground (taking pictures from a rocking boat with no tripod is a bit of a challenge!). I've printed some 8x10's of close-ups I took using this lens and I was quite impressed with the quality. It was also in my price range. Overall, I'd say it was a "good bang for the buck.
This is one of the best camcorders in the market today and I would definitely recommend it to anyone planning to buy a Mini-DV camcorder Positive factors: - Very small and easy to hold with one hand. Can be easily attached even to a mini-tripod with ease. - Excellent widescreen video and hi-fi audio. Your videos finally get that "Hollywood" feel when you shoot movies in 16:9 ratio (widescreen format). Even if you don't have a widescreen TV currently, you will very soon have one as more and more people are buying them. So its better to buy this camcorder and shoot in 16:9 format to enjoy your movies later in widescreen format. - Includes widescreen rotatable LCD so what you see is what you get when you shoot in 16:9 ratio (widescreen format) - Good battery life. One extra battery is enough. You can easily manage a day's worth of shooting with two batteries before recharging them again - Includes docking station making it easier to connect to computer or TV. If you have a good computer with a firewire port, please buy a firewire cable to connect the camcorder to your computer. You can download your movie in excellent clarity in .avi format and edit it as required - Make sure to change the audio setting to 16 bit (instead of the default 12 bit) for very good hi-fi audio - Touchscreen menu system is great. You don't have to search for any buttons as they are all available in the touchscreen menu itself. - 10X optical zoom is more than sufficient for ordinary home videos. Anything more produces more "shaking" and would necessiate the use of a tripod. When you shoot without a tripod, 10X is the best zoom you can achieve without worrying about shaky videos - Widescreen still photo. The photo clarity is OK not too good. So please don't expect great shots. Since the photo is in 16:9 format, you can take panoramic photos and cover more people in group shots - Nightshot: Cool feature that records using infrared light. Useful for shooting at night as you can record a video even in 100% darkness - Color widescreen viewfinder - Very useful when you are running down on batteries and need to use the viewfinder. The color widescreen viewfinder gives an excellent picture and is as good as the LCD in clarity Negative factors: - Outdoor videos especially in bright sunlight are overexposed. So please adjust the white balance when shooting outdoors. Add the white-balance menu to your shortcuts so that you can easily access it and return to default once you start shooting indoors - Sensitive microphone may pick up button clicks (best to turn off the button click "beep" sound). Notes: - Use a fresh cassette after recording 2 or 3 times on the same cassette. The head tends to get dirty if you re-record on the same cassette more than 3 times - You can edit movies in Windowx XP using Windows Movie Maker, but beware it does not support 16:9 ratio video. Hence your videos look ugly as you shot them in 16:9 but Movie Maker converted it to 4:3. Invest in Pinnacle Software version 9 or 10 for better movie editing capabilities. Pinnacle is the only software, I am aware of, that preserves teh 16:9 ratio. Even Roxio could not allow 16:9 format. - You can also invest in wide-angle lens as it gives excellent coverage
I was looking specifically for the magic combination of an all-around video and still camera that was compact and built very solid that I can travel with easily.  I have had this camera since Dec 19th, 2006.I had very bad luck with my previous camera, a Canon Elura that used MiniDVs.  When it worked, the videos were great, but the cassette mechanism kept falling out of adjustment and failing on trips or gatherings, and I lost many unrecoverable moments!  I had an extended warranty and sent it back 3 times, but they were never able to fix it properly. Perhaps this was an unusual lemon, but I did not want to take the chance again! Of the many media types, I've been told the SD cards are the most durable and almost indestructable.  I liked the idea of no moving parts for recording videos.In addition, I was tired of having a separate digital and video camera, and the technology has finally arrived to combine the two.For the non-professional camera person looking to catch candid home and travel shots and videos, I've found this is to be a great little camera.  It is amazingly small, and really will fit in a coat pocket. Extremely solid, it is also a snap to use, yet still provides powerful manual override abilities.  The camera turns on within a few seconds.  The video colors are extremely natural and not oversaturated in any way, and the resolution very fine.  The microphone works well, and of course there is no "tape hiss" since there is no tape.  The still photos are of fair quality. I printed some at 8 x 10 and they looked decent: However, if very-high quality photos are what you are after this is NOT the camera for you. Again, this is definitely for the snap-and-shoot-for-memories crowd, not for people who want to win photography awards. The miniscule pop-up flash is amazingly powerful.I also looked at the Sanyo which has a competing SD model with a higher still photo resolution ability, but it does not have any motion compensation ability. Given how small these cameras are, it is not possible to hand-hold without jiggling it a lot, so I ruled the Sanyo out.Okay, now the negatives.  There are quite a few, but for what it does I still found this to be the best camera for my purposes:(1) The camera does not record well in low-light conditions, I'm sure due to the light required for 3CCD color processing and the small size of the lens (cost of being compact!). Filming indoors requires pretty good light to ensure decent videos.  My christmas tree light pictures were disappointing, and my backlit scenes came out looking like shadow-puppet plays.(2) The cost of buying additional 4GB cards is high, and I am worried about misplacing them because they are so small.(3) I experienced wide swings in over- and under-exposed still photos using the flash, although I was (usually) able to balance the brightness and contrast with my photo editor.  I'm sure this is partly due to not being used to the camera yet, but the whole idea is not to have to worry about such things.  Flash fill-in on backlit subjects works amazingly well.(4) The LCD display on the camera is not synchronized to the same level of brightness and contrast as your TV set or your PC, which you will have to adjust upwards during playback. Thankfully, my Sony TV allows custom adjustments for each input source. Ditto when you are creating DVD's...you will need to increase the brightness and contrast to match what you see when playing back a scene through the camera's own LCD viewer.(5) There is no still photo zoom playback on the camera (at least I have not found it yet). Frequently, I think a snapped photo comes out okay, only to realize when "zooming" the image on the pc to review the details that it is slightly blurry and I need to retake it.(6) You will need to use the included software to view the MPEG2 videos, as MPEG2 is not an included driver in the editing tools I've reviewed.  (7) There was no still photo editing software included, only video software. I supposed Panasonic assumes  everyone has their own photo editing software already, but I didn't.  My Canon photo editing software works for these photos, so I am using that.(8) Finally, the battery fits inside an enclosed compartment, so you are not able to buy an extended battery pack. Since there is no energy required for running a hard drive, DVD burner or tape, admittedly the batteries seem to last longer before recharging, but I still can't see taking a trip with less than 2-3 packs.  I guess I will be spending extra on more batteries!Even with these drawbacks, there is no doubt that this is an amazing sleek winner with really no competitor in its class that I intend to use heavily at home and on my travels
After much research I finally found the binoculars that fit my every need.  The price was right, the delivery was right on schedule, and the product is excellent
i helped develop the danger hiptop (aka "t-mobile sidekick) and hated holding its brick-like nature to my head ... i wanted a good headset ...the only problem is i *hate* earbuds, so i wasn't looking forward to shopping for/buying one.  i went to the local super-electronics store, and abusing their return policy, bought one of every headset they had to try -- 23 headsets to be exact ... i picked up the jabra only to be a complete-ist, figuring there was no way i'd buy its star-trek-bugs-crawling-in-chekov's-ear styling.but after trying them all, the jabra was *easily* the best feeling and best fitting.  in a nutshell, here are the things i like about this unit in particular:* it comes with 6 different fittings (3 sizes for the right and the left), so you get a chance to get a *much* closer fit than some generic ear piece.* contrary to what others have said here, the ear pieces stay *very* snug in your ear (if they don't, you're not fitting them correctly).* i wear glasses, so i can't tolerate over-the-ear headsets.  this, of course, is great in that way.* i like having the model with the microphone boom over the classic ear-only jabra because it:  1. let's people know you're talking on the phone, and less likely to interrupt you while you're talking.  2. i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top down and be heard without a ton of wind noise.* it's small and easy to wrap up into my cell case.also in the newest version, they've adding a securing "lip" to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece (this definitely was a problem before).to top it all off, jabra's support is excellent.  i called their 800 number when my securing clip for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me *three* replacements, free of charge, along with a ball point pen for my "troubles."at 10 bucks, these things are a steal ... using one with my hiptop is a joy -- it means i can still contruct sms's, type in emails, add messages and addresses to my address book whilst talking on the phone.  if you have a data device of any kind, this will make your phone experience twice as good.a truly great product from a company that knows how to treat its customers right.  what more could you want?thanks for reading
These are very good and not expensive.You buy these at Staples and they charge $5 more.I agree that a public exchange is needed. If anyone knows of one, can you please post that information here. We'll all appreciate it!Anybody want to trade the extras

I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone.  It has more than enough volume.  It comes with both a right and left ear adapter.  Fits pretty good and I have medium sized ears. Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it.  It is very comfortable though. If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset.
I purchased the pink razr with Cingular service and couldn't be happier. I have had it for about a month and have had no problems at all. I am very happy with it. T-mobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular
This is really cool phone and has many features. Unfortunately, you could not use some of these features in the U.S. One thing I do not understand why unlocked phones are so expensive in the US and retailers charge much more price. Its price is just 429.99 on the Nokia's web page.The phone gets 5 stars but the retailer's price gets -2 stars.
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be.  It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  I am going to buy another in a different color
Provides great protection for the Treo,but does add a noticeable amount of thickness,making it more of a bundle
Great reception, great volume controls, easy to use... I have the blue, my husband, the black... To the reviewer who said, "too thin" - well, don't get the thin phone then... Works great with his blue tooth and my jabra (plug in) - even comes with the adaptor for plug in phones... which other phone would most likely make you buy.  We're in our late 20s/early 30s - and just dig the phone.  Fits perfect in a small purse or wallet.  One issue DH has -- the antenna is right near the microphone you speak into (bottom of the phone) and when he is on speaker phone, he tends to hold it there, and it sometimes can make your bars go down.  That is it, and all you have to do is readjust the way you hold the phone
I purchased this phone to replace my land line and have not been disappointed. I haven't used all the functions yet (downloading music), but haven't had any problems with anything else. Here are some pros and cons:Pros1-Colorful/Clear Display2-Good Volume (ringer volume is loud enough and I can hear callers just fine)3-Easy Menu NavigationCons1-No shortcut to get to main menu (have to keep pressing "back" button)2-Battery access (it's really hard to take the casing off to get to the battery and SIM card-could be a good thing though)3-On/Off Button (it's very small-basically have to use my fingernail)
I have a baby pink Razr, and this skin looks so good over it. Also it really adds grip, so it's not as easy to drop, and the silicone stays warm in cold weather, unlike the bare metal of the razr. I would reccomend a silicone skin case for anyone with a razr, they are awesome
This is a great product.  It actually fits into my ear properly and I can hear clearly through it.  It is easy to operate and the charge last for many days.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just the right size
Use it every day, it's a nice connector that does just what it says it does.  As with all Treo/Palm connectors, you need to make sure the contacts are clean to get a good connection.  Wiggling the connector where it meets the Treo is usually enough for it to work for me
I've been a Virgin Mobile customer for a few years now and have to agree with an earlier reviewer--if you want a phone-phone (without all the extra hoopla) this isn't a bad deal.  I "*bought" a red Slice a couple of weeks ago (take note that I'm not one of those people with a cell phone perpetually growing out of one ear) and for my needs (emergencies, quick calls to family from the grocery store) it's just right.  Good points:I got mine for "*free" with Reward Zone points at Best Buy.Fits into a small purse or pocket easily.Nice looking (someone mistook it for a "Chocolate" the other day).Clear reception (long distance calls are just as crystal as local; not sure if this is an "area" thing, but apparently the service in and around Chicago's solid).Pay-as-you-go option works well for someone who doesn't spend a lot of time on the phone.My Slice holds a charge just fine (I've noticed other reviewers have said this is a problem, but so far, so good) and doesn't heat up, as someone else mentioned (maybe that reviewer's got a defective phone or battery?).Not so good points:It's so slim my husband has bet me I'll lose the phone within a couple of months (could be easy to misplace if you keep stacks of papers and books on your desk).Someone else mentioned the odd graphics (hot dog dripping blue sauce, some sort of pipe looking cartoons with teeth.  Seriously, I have no idea what those things might be), but I say it's workable if you have a sense of humor (:Yes, the buttons are small.  I have small hands, slender fingers, and I still manage to bump the "3" whenever I'm trying to shut off the phone.Sometimes it's difficult to turn on (the button doesn't always respond when I push it, though could be I'm a wimp), but once it's on it's fine. I'm thinking this will get broken in with more use.All in all, it's not a bad phone.  Beautiful red.  I find myself staring at it just to appreciate its beauty (phone confessions!).I'm satisfied with mine.  And since I haven't forked out hundreds of dollars--or any dollars, really--I won't feel too guilty when/if I do manage to lose it under a pile of paperwork! 
I have had this for 2 months now, and it has worked out well. I use it on my Cingular 8125 phone while I exercise, I can listen to audiobooks on a sports headphone. When a call comes, the AudiblePlayer pauses, and I can answer the phone with the built-in button. Voice quality is fine on my end (in both ears) and I have received no complaints from the other end, unlike the other reviewer (maybe he got a bad unit, or his stereo connector is dirty?). When the call is over, the AudiblePlayer resumes. I never have to stop my exercise, or even slow down! My only complaint is that the volume control doesn't work worth beans. When you rotate it, at various positions, you will hear from one ear or the other. There are a few positions where you will hear in both ears; but, that is not at the maximum volume. This is a bit annoying, but something I can live with. I just leave it at one position (close to the max volume, but a little less), and use the volume control on my cell phone to adjust volume
I've had my snap-on case for about a month and I love it. The magenta color looks very much like the original pink razr phone.The bottom case could fit a little more snugly, but it's not a problem
The case fits like a glove!  Appears high quality with the rich leather look and feel and detailed stitching.  The cover and back were easy to attach and did not scratch my phone, which I checked by removing the case. My only complaint was that I did not like the small mount on the back to attach the carry clip since I never carry my phone on my belt. The attachment kept my phone from laying flat.  No problem, if you slide off the back cover, and take off the small foam piece on the inside, you will see a tiny screw.  Just unscrew and remove the mount.  There will be a hole in your cover; if you do not like that just reapply the foam piece. Attach the back cover to the phone and then fill in the hole with a piece of felt.  Looks fantastic. If you are a clip user, the clip is clear plastic and cheap looking and I found it difficult to remove the phone from it. But maybe that is a good thing so that it won't fall off accidentally.I cannot comment on how well the case will wear since I have only had a few days.  My friends that have seen it love the new look.  I chose the navy blue case and am truly amazed at how well the case fits the phone.  Awesome!!
I have had this phone for about 6 months now and all together is has been great. I mean it dont have bluetooth but besides that its good. I have had so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces. This phone i dont have that problem it is really made good. i have dropped it off my car going down the road and went back and got it and its fine.
This product is definitely worth the $30. The leather is nice and what you can't see from the picture is that the item is held into the case by a plastic covering over the keyboard. When closing the keyboard, the plastic does catch a little, but I think that will go away the more I use it. The phone fits snugly into the case and no part of the screen is covered by the leather exterior. Access to the buttons have been made easy. Each exterior button is given its own hole in the leather. The ok button and ptt button on the left are covered by leather however there is clear markings in the leather designating, "ok" and "ptt." The leather faceplate is secured by a magnet providing easy and quick access to the touchscreen. On the flopside of the faceplate is a convenient mesh pouch for memory cards or etc. Another thing not mentioned in its description is that it comes with a belt clip, however there is no place to secure the belt clip onto the case. Highly Recommende
I PURCHASE THIS PHONE FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR XMAS. AND IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED.I ALSO WAS VERY PLEASE WITH IT
Very nice, but I don't like the belt clip.  If I remove the belt clip there is still an impediment where it use to be
This phone is also sold as the Dopod 838 Pro in Asia (it's quite popular in Singapore), and the HTC TyTN in Europe, but in an unlocked model. and quite a bit more expensive than what Cingular sells it for here.  If you are using this as your first PDA phone from another non Windows product, you will think it's a heavy, over feature laden product that you will never fully use, and its a problematic one at that.  Having said that, this is probably one of the best Windows PDA phones available today.  The features of this phone (3.5G, Bluetooth 2.0, etc. ) are such that you would never need to bring a laptop with you.  You can even install Skype Mobile on this phone.  The keyboard stows away well, and has good feel.There were initial problems with this phone in the Asian market, that have now been since resolved, and is now robust and reliable.But one caveat to keep in mind when using this product...it runs Windows Mobile.  Meaning, if you are not familiar with Windows devices, it may frustrate you...it doesn't respond like a non Windows cell phone.  But, if you can overlook that, it will perform better than anything available...even Blackberry devices do not compare to this
Extra styli are probably useful for the vast majority of us who lose things.  This is one better as it has a pen built in.  Just unscrew the tip of the stylus and you've got a pen.  You never know when you'll need one, so when you do there it is.  It also blends in well with the design of my Treo 700wx both visually and tactile-ly.  Good stuff
I bought this case for my LG Chocolate and it is perfect.  The belt clip is very strong, making accidental unclipping rare. The pouch is made of reinforced leather and nylon which protect the phone from any impacts.  The front flap is also reinforced leather and is secured closed by two magnets.  The bottom of the case has a small hole for access to the Chocolate's "End" button.  This allows you to silence calls without having to remove the phone from the case.  The only dislike I have is the name "Cellnet" embossed on the front flap, but this is not really a big deal.  I would recommend this case to anyone who owns a Chocolate
I got this phone 2 weeks back although I have seen this with my cousin in Singapore quite sometime back. Just right off the box, the phone is quite impressive. Many complain about the response time - yes, this phone is slow but doesn't bother me - far better than my windows machine  Overall, very good phone for what it offers. Pros:*	This phone tops in ergonomics, ease of use, presentation, features, Bluetooth, speakerphone and call quality. *	Wi-fi is worth mentioning separately. It is simply superb.*	Nokia's connection manager is far superior than anyone else in the market. It handles very efficiently that one can easily choose between several access points and save lots of money. I accidentally downloaded a big chunk of data and going to pay through my nose next month!*	All the apps that come with this phone are quite good. *	BT sync with my apple is just fine with iSync. Also I transfer music/themes/ringtones using data cable from my Wintel. The phone automatically toggles to "Mass storage" mode when it is connected to PC, which is pretty neat. *	I haven't faced any such problem as I charge my gadgets daily. I also tried leaving it uncharged and it comes for 2-3 days, good enough for my call volumes. *	Symbian browser is fast and stunning. Bookmarks feature is neat. Having the wi-fi feature helps you to set all the bookmarks while you're at home and then use it wisely while you are away. *	Camera quality is good. Dual camera is just a great idea. Camera settings are similar to professional cameras - very very impressive!*	Tried the video mode and came fine. *	Battery life, as many claim, seems short - but I charge my gadgets daily - so not a big issue*	The headset that comes with the phone is really good. *	Tonnes of themes, apps etc available for this phone..... Cons*	My first biggest problem is that the main navigation key is badly designed. It is made of cheap plastic and almost 8 out of 10 times I "selected" an option when I was actually trying to navigate to left. It is SO frustrating.*	My second biggest problem with this phone is when the slider is on, the screen light does not come up. So you won't know - even in the day - which button to press to answer the question "Unlock phone?" - you will get that by practice but it is truly a pain. *	The process of taking a picture sucks. The picture what you see on the screen when you hear the shutter sound is NOT what you get. There is a serious lag between the shutter click and the final image. I sincerely hope if there would be some s/w patch for this. I am anyway not a big fan of phone cameras - with an exception of Sony Ericsson W810i. That is one far superior camera quality I saw so far.*	Slider lock and unlock feature is good and bad. I am putting this on the bad section as even if the slider opens in your pocket, the phone could turn on and end up with accidental redialing. So you would need a small app to do the locking properly.Overall - good phone. At this point, Nokia has better phones like N95 etc - of course very expensive.
This charger is awesome.  It is very compact when retracted and when the cord is extended, it doesn't get in the way like the spiral cords do.  The cord is thin, not bulky.  I never measured the cord when extended, but it is much longer than most
This was an excellant purchase.  It was exactly what I needed and works as well as one that would have cost me $20 or more in the stores
This charger works perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack.  It is very affordable and much less expensive than buying with the phone
   It's a very nice phone!!!!!!
I recently purchased the black metal case for my 8525, and have had a few problems w/it.  First the belt clip is kind of small and broke when I tried to clip it to my belt.  Second the aluminum case isn't the sturdiest, so now it's sort of bent (referring to the hinge, I guess I've been really rough on my phone), but I just bend it back to where it's supposed to be (referring to the hinge).  But the case does what it's supposed to do...my phone looks and performs just as the day I got it.  When I informed the vendor that the belt clip broke I just wanted a new clip, instead I recieved a full refund, so that was a pleasant suprise.  I actually liked it so much I bought my wife one when she got her phone
I have had it since October and it is clearly the best phone I have ever owned.  It has also replaced my camera, and I am now never without a camera.I attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited.  They don't give the phone a second glance, not realizing it's got the 3.2 megapixel capability.  I have got tons of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows.After throwing in a 1GB memory stick (I think it was $79?) it is now storing a half gig of my best music and the display says it will hold 300+ pics right now.The movie function rocks too, however you are going to want to be up very close to the subject.  The sound playback of the movies is fantastic though, so at least concert videos make for good listening.The phone works flawlessly with my PC.  If I throw it on the USB cable, it pops up instantly as another drive, just like the camera.  Just drag on/off the music and pics.  All pics are very nicely numbered and named.If I don't care about viewing the files and just want to move stuff on and off the phone, I don't even take it out of my pocket.  The bluetooth connection allows me to use their software to move things around.Also very cool was that it pops up on my computer as a Modem, which I actually was able to use immediately in my PC Anywhere program.In terms of being a phone, yeah it's great.  The contact list is easy to work with, the call clarity is no issue at all, good signal, no dropped calls, etc. etc. (this is all with Cingular).  Speaker phone works well.It needs charging about every 3rd day, charges very quickly.  Charges slower but with the USB plugged in it also charges.  The only thing I can think to complain about is that when using the USB cable to charge, it only wants to charge it to 89%.  If I want 100% I have to throw it on the real charger for a few minutes.
This case does what it is supposed to do... it protects your palm treo phone.  It is very nice looking and durable.  The only negative comment that I will make about the case is that occasionally the memory card gets ejected when taking the phone out of the case due to the snug fit.  That is why I gave it a 4/5.  Amazon has the best price for the case and it is well worth the price
I ordered this cable (two of them actually) to use on the LG 8300.  The driver disc contains software for the 8300 only not the 5300.  Once loaded, it found the phone easily.  I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.  The price of the cable was excellent.  I was unable to locate a data cable locally and was happy to find one on Amazon, even though it was only available through a third party.  All in all, I recommend the product to those in need of cables for the LG 8300.  For those wishing to use it on the LG 5300 please be aware there appears to be no driver included for your phone.
The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be.  It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  I am going to buy another in a different color
This holster is by far better than the stock holster that comes with the phone. It has a lower profile which means it sits closer to your belt.It is also is much easier to actuate than the stock holster. The thumb tab is oriented in just the right direction for easy in/out. The phone clips in solidly and doesn't fall out
If you want a cell phone that is well made, looks good, feels good to use and is a really good phone as opposed to a phone and a bunch of other things the V360 is an excellent choice.  It has enough features to keep things interesting but is easy to use and above all is a really good phone that does not sacrifice call quality or battery life to a bunch of useless features that I don't want.  it also looks and feels good and is thus a pleasure to use
I will only use Krusell products as they are better than Best. Customer Service is as good as the product. There is no finer quality and the selection of products is well above the rest. Krusell products cost a little more but quality and durability far surpass the price. The rating should be a 10
Item arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised, charges the phone in about 15 minutes of driving
Great product - works quickly when charging my Moto V555 in the car.  Highly recommend it
I am thoroughly enjoying the longer battery life. I had to charge my old battery everyday. I only have to charge the new battery every 2 - 3 days
This item is very excellent. I was suprise it does not comes with 2 screen protector only, but also a squeegeem, cloth and cleaning instructions. This shield fits very nicely over my phone screen
I have used the i530 for a little over two years and have had no problems with the unit, or with NEXTEL's service.  To simplify your reading, here is a list of pros and cons.Cons:  A little chunky; Lacks up to date features and tech (such as color screen, external display, etc.); Battery life is nothing to write home about.Pros:  Durability (been dropped off a roof, still going strong); Looks (yellow model); Call quality is excellent; Good speakerphone; Digital 2-way is a great feature.Overall, I am very satisfied with my i530.  The only issue among the cons that is of any real concern is the battery life, but this is characteristic of most NEXTEL phones - perhaps due to the nature of the iDEN network on which they operate.  Even after two years, my original battery lasts more than a day with moderate use.  A pain?  Slightly, but given the advantages of NEXTEL, its worth remembering to charge up more often.  Please beware of several overly negative reviews on NEXTEL posted below - my experience with their coverage, customer service, etc. has been very positive.  Just make sure you do your homework with respect to coverage before you sign up with any wireless company.  Go with the one that gives the best coverage in the areas in which you live, work, or travel.  It's always best to actually put the printed coverage maps to the test with a real phone.  Some providers are overly optimistic.  NEXTEL's maps are pretty legit, at least as far as I have discovered
The cover design is well made based on the requirements. The problem according to me is the device not be able to avoid the dust on the LCD screen because of the openings on both the sides. In my opinion, compared to all other covers, this is a simple design and will allow you to easily insert and remove the BlackBerry out of the case
I have gone through several smartphones in the past 4 months (Including, Cingular HTC 8125, and Nokia E62)  and can safely say that this is the best phone I have owned.   The Palm operating system is much easier to use than the Windows operating system ( albeit, less powerful) and much more customizable and synchronization-friendly than the Symbian OS.  Its great for easy installation of software.Pros:- Very customizable interface, making the phone very user friendly. You can set any application or any number to dial as a preset button. - Palm OS is easy to use, and thus, you actually get to take advantage of the many features of the phone, unlike Windows Mobile, which is definantly more powerful than Palm OS, but cumbersome and difficult to use at times. - You can use this as a one handed phone...very important for people like me who like to drive and text/email. - Perfect size, weight and feel of the phone in your hand and on your ear. The lack of the antennae stub on this model is a huge aesthetic improvement.-  Easy synchronization with your Outlook mailbox or with the Palm Desktop - Can set the phone to automatically retrieve your emails and alert you, which is very useful  (although limits battery life) Cons:- Battery life is somewhat worse than other phones.  I have to charge my phone every night, and I probably use about 15 minutes of internet, 30 minutes of mp3 player, autoretrieve email every 30 min,  and 2 hour talk time as well as some other Palm functions.    If you have it set on auto-retrieve for your email, the battery life seems to decrease impressively.    The newer manufactured 680s have a fix installed for this problem apparently.- You cant plug in your own headsets into the device ( like your iPod headphones)  you have to use a specific headphone that fits and you can get it from Palm. I hate that. I suggest buying this phone unlocked from Palm, instead of from Cingular.  I got it for 350$  with a 1G SD card and stereo headphones included. Also,  if you get it from Cingular, they always ruin the look of the phone by plastering their logo all over both sides of the phone.  OVERALL:  extremely satisfied with this easy to use, highly customizable, powerful smartphone, despite a somewhat shorter battery life. 
I have tried many many cell phones but this phone is unbelievable. I put a 1 gig memory card in it. Right now, I have a 140,000 word dictionary on it, the NIV bible, Star Wars, many videos of my son, about 100 wma songs, and a ton of pictures. It syncs up to MS Outlook like a charm so all of my contacts, appts, tasks, and emails are always up to date. It comes with bluetooth and works great with my logitech headset. It also has wifi which has been flawless with my wireless network and is very speedy. The screen is absolutely gorgeous. The camera takes decent pictures and video. One of the best features is the battery life. For all it does it lasts an incredibly long time. I have not found a smartphone that even comes close to these features especially for the price. I like it waaaay better than the treo, blackberries, Q, or any other qwerty device. It's glued to my hip and I use it all the time. I love it!!
I have only had this phone for a few days now but I have used every feature it has to offer. I must say that this is the best phone I have ever owned. The only real problem I have is that my fat fingers sometimes hit buttons I didn't intend but it's really not that big of a deal; I just need to re-train my hands. I am happy with the picture quality as well as video quality. The audio options are great for me as all I really wanted to be able to do is load my own songs on to use as ringtones and Motorola made this a pretty simple task
Is Good, protecs every corner of your phone, the keyboard and the screen! Its very good! 100% Recomendation
good product for how cheap i got it for absolutely nothing wrong with it.  THANK
I just bought this headset for use with an LG VX-8300. The stereo headset lets you listen to music and talk on the phone (has microphone built in). Works fine
Ordered 2 cables from DLN.  They shipped quickly, keep me updated and the cables arrived well packaged.  They are good quality and work well.  I like that it charges the phone as you Sync up.Highly recommended - and at such a good price
Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow
This case is made for an L6. The L2 uses the same case, so they both fit within this rubber case. However, the keys are laid out differently on the L6 - so this case has the grooves slightly off on the keys. I didn't give it a low rating, because it's well built and is actually a really great product - just wanted to give  other L2 owners a warning. It works well, but it's just a little funky on an L2, but totally usable. For the price, you just can't beat it - and it's a much better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out of your pocket
I've had this phone for about a week now and I'm glad I waited to post a review because my initial reaction was not very positive. Coming from owning a RAZR and many Windows-based devices, there was an initial learning curve to some of the functions. Also, I was NOT convinced that the strange keyboard would really recognize what you were attempting to type. Boy was I wrong about that one. OK, so for the review.My motivation for purchasing was primarily to get a PHONE first, with a few bells and whistles for when I just want to play with the device. The Pearl fits that bill perfectly. Phone quality is excellent. Loading ringtones (a pain at first) proved to be relatively easy once I did a little research. Ringtones play very loud and clear. The music player is MUCH better than first impressions would lead you to believe. After a few hours of frustration, I was all ready to purchase a 3rd party app. Again, did some research, visited a few forums, and found out there is much more functionality in the included music player than you might realize. As an owner of a NANO, I was disappointed with the interface of the player. But once you go into the menu functions, you'll find much more functionality. It's not an ipod, but it works as an decent replacement. And if you're not an ipod owner, you'll likely have no complaints. Sound of tunes is quite nice when using headphones. Camera is only so-so, but I don't really care about that anyway. Must admit that I thought it would be better since it is a megapixal camera. The couple of pictures I took were dark and somewhat grainy. Part of why I dropped my rating from 5 stars. As far as email, I have a BB from work and they won't let me use a non-work issued device to access the network, so I have no opinion on email functionality. Organizer features (calendar, tasks, notes, etc) seem more than adequate. Much better than any of my old Pocket PC devices.The only complaints I would have is that there are still 2 basic things that I haven't been able to figure out and while I'm admittingly not a techie, these should be pretty basic and intuitive. One, I would like to set one of my ringtones as the default ringer. That should be fairly simplistic but I can't figure it out. Two, I would like to change the order of the icons on some of the themes. Again, should be pretty basic, but no go. Almost forgot, can't listen to music through bluetooth. Not sure why, but this is really my only MAJOR complaint.Only minor complaints. All in all, a pretty sweet device. And BTW, form factor and looks are simply the best out there. I came so close to purchasing the Blackjack, very happy that I went with the Pearl.UPDATE - Figured out how to set default ringtone and move icons. Coming from a Windows mobile environment, I was expecting something along the lines of: Start-programs-etc-etc. Everyting in windows takes so many keystroks. With the Pearl, it was so easy. I was simply expecting it to be much more difficult based on my prior experience. I'm going to still keep it at 4 stars because of the lack of BT stereo. Otherwise, as close to a perfect device as I've used (and I've used quite a few)
This is a great phone for a first phone for kids. I have had it for six months and it is the best one I have ever had. I like it so much that I don't wanna get rid of it
I've been using my Blackjack for about 3 months now and I love it. Sure there are things I would change, but the Blackjack has come very close to fulfilling all my wishes. Cons: * The keyboard buttons are really small, but then I'm not sure how you could fit all of them on the phone if they were bigger. And I wouldn't want the phone to get any bigger. * If you ever see an ad that has a number like this - "1-800-Big-Deal" good luck on figuring out the alpha-to-numeric translation. Haha. I had that issue not long ago. However, I think all smartphones have that issue.* Lacks voice dialing via bluetooth headset. This one is big for me. I upgraded to the BJ from a Razr and really miss this feature.Pros:The list would be too long if I mentioned all the great features about this phone. So here are a few:* Browser support is awesome! I can view everything, even Flash apps!* VPN support. If you are corporate, 'nuff said. This rocks.* Easy bluetooth setup and management.* Perfect size for a Smartphone. Not too wide and very thin.* Glass screen (doesn't scratch) and screen resolution is unbelievable.* Quick toggle scroll button on side is a life saver.* Extended life battery comes with the phone. * Easy side access to SD card. No having to slide the battery off to remove or replace.There are a ton of great things about this phone. I hear the iPhone is supposed to be the real deal, but until I see for myself, I'm sticking with this beauty. Buy one. You won't be sorry. I got mine for $75 with a $75 rebate. Free? Can't go wrong which ever way you look at it. :)
These replacement styluses fit perfectly into the phone and are an exact replacement for the original phone stylus
This is a great cover to the Sansa MP3 player.  It is heavy duty rubber that is thin where it can be and thicker in all the necessary places.  It has a hard plastic screen shield that protects the Sansa screen from scratching or shattering.  You'd be silly not to purchase this $20 case to protect your $150+ investment.The one downside I can forsee is that the cover is too thick at the bottom to allow the player to sit in most cradles, docks, or speakers.  It is not difficult to put the case on, but it would be frustrating to take it on and off often.  Just something to consider if you see yourself using the player in docks or speakers often.  The standard USB cable that come with the product works great with the toughskin on
I'm a previous owner of Body Glove Cel Phone cases (a Moto V810).I purchased this item from Amazon a few days ago for my 6255.  My Cel fits perfectly. The case protects every part of my Cel (buttons, screens, jacks) and the use of every option in the cel is so comfortable as it would be without the case, and looks nice.My next phone will have its body glove case too
We were deperate for a charger.  The local stores seemed to be out of them.  And we got it overnight as requested.  Unbelieveably fast.  Thank you - thank you - thank you!
This car charger for the Blackberry 7100 series is every bit as good as those available from the cell phone stores at a fraction of the price.  It is well made and works perfectly.  I also use it to charge my Motorola Bluetooth headset that has the same USB mini jack
This product was a great deal. These can be found other places for over $20. If you are like me and drop your phone constantly, then this is a great product for you
Overall, I am very happy with this product; it protects the phone without taking away from its beauty nor does it make the phone bulkier. My only compliants are that it does not come with a screen cover and it makes the phone slightly harder to slide open.
I bought my Treo 750v a couple of days ago. I got really impressed with its features and had none of the problems already reported, like short time lived batery.The only problem I am facing is with setting my voice mail.The icon shown in the today page does not accept any number I will to attach to it. As a result, I was forced to create a new speed dial icon with my voice mail number.I really hope this is a problem to be fixed soon by Palm with a downloadable file because, except for this problem, Treo 750 is really great
Idropped my new phone at the bank without this case and the phone went everywhere - in 3 places.... With this cover, it is definatly protected....I don't like the smoke color... but who really cares for the price..
I am so glad I purchased the Logitech Mic for PS2.  The quality of the sound is awesome, and my kids are having a blast with it.  The price is reasonable.  My kids take very good care of things, but I'm not so sure that it could withstand any mistreatment.  I will probably end up buying another one
One of the most common complaints is that Xenosaga Ep. II's battle system is annoying and ponderous because "even in 'regular' battles, it forces you to spend many turns Stocking just so that you can do decent damage to enemies." This is actually a form of codespeak. What these people are really saying is "I'm not very bright, and even after several hours of playing Ep. II, I somehow never realized how to use the battle system efficiently." Ep. II puts a great deal of emphasis on each character's attack attributes. Attacks are classified as either Physical or Ether, and then there are elementals (fire, ice, lighting, aura) and finally there are types (slash/pierce/hit). Sound complicated? Eh, a little more so than the average RPG. Not nearly as bad as something like Vagrant Story. All you have to do is use Analyze on any enemy you're unfamiliar with to see their weaknesses, and then use the Change command to bring in the character that has the proper attack. When you come across enemies with Physical/elemental weaknesses, there are Ethers which you can cast to add that element to a character's physical attack. If their weakness is ether/elemental, then just use the standard elemental spell Ethers against them. This is all you need to do to make battles flow at nice, normal pace.For some reason, the vast majority of Ep. II players seemed to never realize this. Instead, they saw their only option to be using the Stock command for nine (NINE!) turns in a row before beginning their attack. Even on wimpy garden variety wandering monsters! They took no heed of enemy weaknesses, using characters with physical/fire based attacks against enemies weak vs. ether/ice. RPG players used to have a reputation for being the more intelligent gamers. I wonder what happened... A lot of Ep. I fans never bothered to play Ep. II because negative word of mouth spread so quickly amongst the fanbase as soon as the JP version was released. But now that Ep. III is out (and it's truly fantastic) a lot of them will finally play Ep. II soon. I hope they do better than the first rounders did
I have to start off by saying if you own the 06 version, then dont bother updating, as you may not notice many of the updates/upgrades.Is this an awesome game? Yes, but it has a few holes even still; 1) Too much sacking on your QB by the cpu. 2)The CPU will run the ball so darn often, it is a joke. 3)The game might strain your PS2 as it loads so often,4)If you want to play on all-madden level, you are FORCED to play with QB vision on, which we all know stinks!Basically, they have tossed in a few more options so you can play as a blocker or etc on offense and you have more advanced defensive controls such as match-ups, assignments, etc. Also, the franchise mode is still really great and the superstar mode is quite enjoyable as well.What about this game is really good? Well, it is safe to say the graphics are quite good and the commentary is solid once again. The crispness of the passing is great and the running game is a big part of this years focus. It is still really fun to have a running QB with a strong arm, it is an easy way to dominate the game! BTW, the new kicking scheme is actually really easy after test it out a time or two, now I am making 90% FG's easily! You can fully tinker with the AI and change all other settings as well.The rosters are also accurate but personally, if you own madden 06, wait 4-6 more weeks and then buy this one for $19 as a PS2 best of game
If you liked the first Disgaea you will just love the second one!  The game builds upon all the strong points of the previous game.  Now instead of taking FOREVER to get powerful characters you can achieve characters like the archer, ninja, etc. much quicker.  The main characters are still hilarious, and I love the fact that you get to see Laharl, Etna and the gang again in this one.  (Go Prism Rangers =/).Once again the plot isn't too twisted, but it is enjoyable. Back to the game play though, its similar to the old one, but you have more options.  For one, you can JOIN the Dark Assembly.  In the item world you can not only level your item, but go to an assembly, improve the luck of your item, and purchase items such as alcohol and bombs to influence  the assembly.  There is also the new addition of the subpoena.  These are felony charges that your characters receive based upon too many murders, too much hp etc. etc.  These are "medals of honor" in the demon world, and allow your characters more prestige, not to mention they once again make you want to go to the item world. Another bonus, you can transfer the bailiff for your subpoena onto your item, so you can get a felony charge, and level your item at the same time.This game is a fabulous addition to any gamer's collection, and I highly recommend it!  Enjoy
At TGS (Tokyo Game Show) 2005, Sony of Japan announced that they were developing an original game for PSP: LocoRoco. Instead of the usual ports or re-creations or compliations of retro games, LocoRoco is a completely new venture. It focuses on a fictional planet where happy LocoRocos (yellow blobs) and MuiMuis (blue figures) live. One day, it is invaded by the Moja Troop, who eat LocoRoco. Your job is to tilt the surface to lead LocoRocos through their planet without getting eaten. You collect flowers, which gives you another LocoRoco. You can combine and separate LocoRocos, as well. You collect bugs as a food source for LocoRocos. Additionally, when you collect MuiMuis, you can get house parts.The game is very easy. As a PSP player of Tekken:DR, complicated combo moves and annoying nuisances with the analog stick make PSP games hard to play--especially ports that we're used to seeing on PSOne and PS2. With LocoRoco, you use 3 buttons during gameplay. The shoulder buttons (LEFT and RIGHT) are used to tilt, tapping the circle button separates LocoRocos, holding the circle button combines them, and holding down both shoulder buttons makes your LocoRocos jump. A lot easier said than done. A demo disc found at EBGames and a demo for download on the PSP Memory Stick show these capabilities and can be found for download at http://www.us.playstation.com/locorocopcdemo. You must have v2.71 for this to work, I might add.Besides a "career" mode, which pivots you into different courses with different color LocoRocos, there are "mini-games" like a Mui-Mui Crane, Chuppa game, and more. You must collect a certain amount of bugs/pickories every game to play these games. Also, there is the LocoRoco House Editor feature that allows you to create a house for your LocoRoco. I haven't yet tested it out but it is an excellent feature, I presume. By collecting MuiMuis in games, you get house parts and you can build a house for your LocoRoco.Besides all of the gameplay features, a large soundtrack is full of bubbly, interesting, and catchy jingles with unique voices. While some find it annoying, it is very catchy and it gets stuck in my head. LocoRocos even sing along in gibberish while the song goes on. MuiMuis do, as well. The graphics are 2D like Mario, which make loading times non-existant and shows off the capability of the PSP's high-performance graphics.In the end, LocoRoco is a game that is intuitive, simple, and beautiful to look at. It is fitted only for the PSP, and it should. Additionally, the gameplay is excellent, pivoting you into many different scenarios with many different characters (like Moja, who attack you or Chuppa, who catapults you into hidden areas). It is clearly worth $40--clearly.PROS-Intuitiveness and Simplicity: Easy to play, fitted for the PSPShows off PSP Graphic Capabilities: Beautiful to look atDifferent Maps, Characters, Colors: Very unique and freshNot a Port or Re-creation/compliation: A completely original gameNo Long Loading Times: 2D graphics prevents thisMini-Games: Lets you take a break from main gameplayCONS-Longevity: Only 40 levels makes you wish for more...Should've Used Characters More: Some characters pop up once...You have to pay money made in career to access mini-games5/5: FUN5/5: GRAPHICS5/5: GAMEPLAY4/5: PLAYABILITY19/20: TOTA
The GTA series has created a new thresshold in video games. With creation of GTA 3, games became increasingly more violent and more controversal. San Andreas is no exception.If this game did not bear the GTA tag, I probably would have rated it higher, but needless to say, I'm a bit disappointed with what rockstar did with this addition to the GTA series. Previous GTAs all had a quirky jab at political and social icons (particularly conversation political and social icons). San Andreas had this, but to a much lesser extent which disappointed me.Another thing which disappointed me about this game was the RPG-like system they put into it. Your accuracy is determined by how often you practice, rather than the players ablity to shoot. Also, unlike previous GTAs, you must now press a button  and slow your walking speed down to manually aim and fire a gun. I HATED this change in the gameplay. This severely limits your ablity to go on rampages, and forces you to use their god-awful auto aim system. If they had not added this function to the game, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more.That being said, there were PLENTY of things I enjoyed about this game. First off, I enjoyed the new depth theyve added to missions. Previously missions were as followed: Kill this, blow up that, run way from these guys, and avoid cops. Missions in this game actually feel like Rockstar put a lot of time into each individual objective. One Mission that particularly comes to mind is the mission where you hop on a plane, have a small shootout on the INSIDE of the vehicle, then fly to liberty cities (a location that you cannot travel to normally) and assassinate some crime bosses. Little things like this show the extra effort the designers put into the game.Another thing I enjoyed about this game is that it is more challengeing than previous GTAs. The very last mission will have you cussing like mad if you havent achieved fire proofing from the firetruck missions. This game is designed at a skill level for someone who has been playing GTA a long time.Also the map is friggin huge! Its about 3 times the size of your regular GTA game. However, unlike previous GTAs, its not packed with little goodies and have special jumps at every corner. Its still fun to explore every corner of the map in this game though.So now for the break down of my reviewPros-Incredibly large map-Challengeing-More new vehicles to hijack-An overall improvement on the missions-Plenty of extra features-GANG WARS-Good voice actingThe Cons-New style of shooting is a huge hinderance-Areas are not as packed with goodies as before-Fewer political cheap shots than SA's predcisoursOverall I would give this game a 8 out of 10 in comparison to video games everywhere, but only 4 out of 10 when compared to its predecesors (5 being average).One other note: If you have an ATI Radeon x700 you may encounter some problems playing this game (not with lag, but with actually loading the game)
This game is really good.Theres a wide varity of lvls to play,and a very good multyplayer system.The game only has a few faults, like a blown up frigate in space sometimes goes through the capital ship.The game also gets a little boring after a while.Besides that,its a great game
Okami rates among the most beautiful games I've ever seen.  The main point of the game is that you're the reincarnation of a god, awakened after a hundred years to dispatch of the evil that's overtaken the land. The entire landscape is bleak and dead--affected by the evil, and it's your task to both fight the ultimate evil, and restore the land using various techniques you learn throughout the game. One of the really interesting aspects of the game is that, since the main character is folk tale diety (in the form of a wolf), the player can affect the environment of the game by drawing with a calligraphy brush. A circle stroke in the sky creates a sun to turn night into day. Another stroke across a dead tree brings it bursting into full bloom. A slashing stroke across your enemies cuts them. My only minor complaint so far is that perhaps it does a little too much shepherding in terms of letting you know where to go next. However, this doesn't detract for the game overall. At the same time, the player does have a good deal of freedom--I haven't felt railroaded through the storyline at all.  Perhaps the extra guidance will make this game more accessible also for people who aren't usually gamers.  If you're looking for something visually interesting, occasionally humorous, and with very different gameplay from the usual fare, Okami is highly recommended. 
You can go wrong, very good equiment, lots of fun easy to carry, the console with most games plus has a great pric
I had purchased this two pack memory card and they are pretty good no problems with memory card
I do not own the headset yet, but I have already ordered it from amazon, and It is supposed to come awhile after my xbox live starter kit, so I will have to use my louzy wired controler with the stock headset until this new one comes. My impression is that it will be a very good product, because it is logitech, and i have that wireless joystick for pc that they make, and it is fablous. The price? Great price. I got mine for somthing like $25. (buy from abuy4u)but it looks like a great product and i look foward to reciving my headset. Yes, 6 hours can last me a weekend.
In truth, there really hasn't been a great Mana game since Secret of Mana back in 1993.  Every Mana game since has been met with astonishing mixed feelings, and Children of Mana is no different.  Why did I buy it knowing this?  For the same reason many Mana fans continue to invest in Mana games.  There's always hope that the next installment will give us the same joy that Secret of Mana did.  Unfortunately, Children of Mana does not do this.  It doesn't rekindle the magic Secret of Mana gave us, but that shouldn't suggest it falls short of it either. The world is in peril when a mana imbalance threatens to send the world back into the dark ages.  It is up to a hero or heroine to stop this from happening and thus you'll set out to save the Mana Tree and the world itself.  Children of Mana by no means has a great storyline going for it.  At least where it falls short in story it more than makes up for in gameplay.No matter how you look at it, Children of Mana is a dungeon crawler.  It is an RPG, but it falls into the dungeon crawling category.  When you enter dungeons they're just swarming with monsters, and you'll be surrounded before you know it.  So you'll have to make your way through a dungeon battling everything in sight until you reach the boss, take him on, and then you're done.  Rinse and repeat.  The process does, at times become annoying, but Children of Mana offers some variety and interesting aspects to the gameplay to make up for it. The first tidbit of interest is how combat works.  It's actually pretty fun to go through dungeons killing things.  It's surprisingly addictive for the first couple of hours.  You've got three hit combos you can perform on enemies.  You can knock enemies into other enemies.  There's quite a bit of intersting things you can do.  However, what also sets it apart from a lot of dungeon crawlers is that you can't ahead of yourself too fast.  First and foremost, you can't equip and use everything you find right off the bat.  The game will actually restrict you from using overly powerful weapons until you have access to certain dungeons or until you meet certain expectations.  This keeps the game from being too simple.You'll also have access to magic, of course.  Each time you go into a dungeon you can take a spirit with you and use the magic that spirit provides for you.  It's interesting to play around with as well.  In dungeons you can also dual wield weapons, although not in the way you'd think.  When I say duel wield I specifically mean you can equip two weapons but only use one each time.  So you can't go about swinging both of them at the same time, which probably would've added more variety to the gameplay otherwise. Along the lines of giving your character a different assortment of weapons, you can also give them gems that can improve their stats or combat abilities.  It's interesting, but not really all that deep.  You'll mostly find or purchase these gems.Another interesting aspect is that the game is completely linear should you decide to dwell into the many sidequests the game has to offer.  Children of Mana is not shy about offering you side missions to go on, and they're actually pretty well worth it.  The problem with the gameplay, however is that this rinse and repeat formula becomes very tiring very fast.  The objective in just about every dungeon is to find what's called a "Gleam Drop" and then bring it back to the "Gleam Well."  It's annoying mostly because each dungeon plays out in the same way.  Fight through a horde of enemies, retrieve the Gleam Drop, fight a boss and leave.  Over time it becomes increasingly repetative.  However, Children of Mana has a great remedy for that too.  It's multiplayer.  Up to four players can play at a time, and the game is so much more fun that way.  You and your friends can make your way through dungeons together, and sometimes it's just a blast to do.  There are moments of slowdown when playing in multiplayer mode, but it's nothing to get too frustrated with, because it doesn't happen too often.  The multiplayer alone adds a lot of variety and complexity to the gameplay.   As far as graphics go the game doesn't look too bad.  The sprites look like they're ripped straight ouf of Sword of Mana... and the game is completely 2D.  However, the Mana games have not been about taking graphics to the limit, they've been about its unique art style, which in Children of Mana is absolutely gorgeous.  It's artwork is just beautiful to look at.  Each environment is given extremely good detail.  The only problem, as I mentioned, are that the sprites are not nearly as detailed.  Musically, Children of Mana sounds fantastic.  It's one of the best sounding DS games out to date.  Very few of the current games hold a candle up to it's fantastic soundtrack. The bottom line is simple: Children of Mana is a very fun game to play with a very mediocre storyline.  There's just enough variety and interest in the gameplay to keep one going for the adventure, even if the storyline is just not all that great to begin with.  However, keep in mind that Children of Mana really is just a dungeon crawl, and it's uncrealistic to expect an RPG that's all about dungeon crawling to have a fantastic storyline that will blow you away.  On the whole, if you're looking for a game that's fun, you'll find it with Children of Mana.  However, if you're looking for a game with a deep storyline and endearing characters, you won't find it in Children of Mana.The Good+Beatiful Artwork+Fantastic Soundtrack+There's a lot of variety to the gameplay+Multiplayer is a blasts+Tons of sidequests to doThe Bad-The storyline isn't good-The gameplay has a lot of vareity, but it's hard to get past the fact that it's repetativ
I bought this game as a xmas gift for my 6 and 10 year old boys. They play this game NON-STOP, basically until they're completely worn out. The game is a perfect way for kids to get exercise in the long winter months! If your kids have a PS2, then this game is a must have!!
I loved this game so much I have gone and got a second copy, mine has stopped working!I love the feeling that an entire world lives within the game and you can always just steal a car and ride, listen to the radio and take in Vice City's many sites.Tommy Vercetti - excellantly cast as Ray Liotta of Goodfellas fame gets out of the slammer and goes back to his turf.  He gets sent to Vice City to get him out of the way because really, they don't want him around anymore and they certainly don't want to answer his questions about why he got jailed.You can ride bikes, take cars, helicopter fly over the city, go through districts with different cultures and work for many gangs.  Bikers, Columbians cops even, accompanied by a sound track that beats the heck out of any other game I've played.  A radio with enough variation to keep everyone happy as they do their drive-bys and cruise looking at women.And the talk shows!  Classy touch.The game play is smooth and with barely a bug to be seen flows from day to night and back again with the city in sync, Vice City at night is amazing, you also get weather variations and the impact of that, in the rain, bikes tend to skid more and you fall off.  It's that kind of attention to detail that means the game never grows tiresome.  The hidden jumps to be done with all manner of vehicles and the taxi/paramedic, etc missions mean the game really is so open ended.  It's been three years and I'm still exploring Vice City.Classic
I'll admit I was a little skeptical about this game. As it turns out, this game rocks! Arena Football fans do not pass this one up! Hopefully when  they make the sequel(yeah, I said SEQUEL)they will include the new AFL2  teams. Tennessee Valley Vipers rule
I like the 05 version better. Sure this has updated playing rosters and the new quarterback function, but it doesn't appear to me EA sports have evolved much over the last 12 months or even few years for that matter. I was expecting the graphics to be better and the gameplay to feel more real but maybe I was expecting too much. I won't buy the 07 when it comes out, I'll wait and see what they can do with it on Playstation 3
In late 04 I decided to give in and purchase THE gaming system at the time that was the original Xbox.  Having not been a real dedicated gamer previously and only played on (and never owned) systems I had little knowledge of how it'd be upon use--but since Halo 2 had just been released to rave reviews I knew I had to try it out (hey, it's HALO, people!).  Man, I was glad I invested in it!  It's a bit large (compared to my best friend's PS2) and is a bit difficult to lug someplace, but the graphics are much better than the PS2 and the games available for it are great (significantly the critically acclaimed Halo series, of course, THE best game out there in my opinion).  There are some issues with how bulky the system is but it's about the quality of gaming rather than how bulky a gaming system is
Neat game but I shouldn't have any trouble killing a couple wolves at level 20.  The 'leveling system' developer should have stayed off the crack pipe.Also I'm the 'Hero of Kavatch' but I don't want to be reminded of it every 6 seconds.  The fact that I saved a town also apparently doesn't entitle me to even pick up an item if I don't own it w/o being thrown in prison.  Very realistic
I really enjoy top down and side scrolling shooters, so take this opinion with that in mind.  The only problem with R-Type is that dying sucks.  When you die you restart from a usually bad position without any powerups.  Once you unlock free-play this can make the game frustrating when you are playing new stages or playing with a different ship etc.  However overall I think it's the best of the R-types and one of the better side scrollers out there.
Why mess with the original.  There are a lot of phonies and copycat controllers that you can get for a discount.  You get what you pay for.  I have several of the standard ones like this and they are quality.  In addition the controls for the Gamecube are similar enough to other Nintendo products so you won't have to learn a completely new system
When I heard that Square was going to remake Final Fantasy IV (originally Final Fantasy II in the U.S.) I was very excited. This game is considered to be one of the greatest Final Fantasy games of all time. All in all I would recomend this game to anyone who is a Final Fantasy fan
Microsoft has created an extraordinary machine. Crisp graphics and so far the library of games available are impressive. The only problem I have is that Microsoft produced a defective product. For the first few months it played fine with only aa couple of moments where the games would freeze. No biggie. Then it died. No problem, sent it in for repairs under warranty. Free of charge. Cool. Got it back and it played well with me actually beating Ghost Recon with no problems. I stopped playing for a while but when I tried playing again BAM! Ring of Death. Warranty over. $130-140 dollars to fix. Yay. I think I'm going to throw it against the wall and buy a new one. Hopefully Microsoft has found all the solutions to the defects.
While I did not have to spend retail on this headset(I got it along with an Xbox and several other things on Ebay), I did have to buy the communicator(which can be found on gamestop.com) and it was still worth the money.  It blocks out background noises so that the people you are talking to wont hear other people in the household talking or guests that you have with you talking to you.  While it is not worth $50, if you can get it as part of a deal with something else, by all means do it.Note: I said this before in my review but the Communicator can be found on gamestop.com or on Amazon if you type: Xbox Live Communicato
This game is truly worth the wait.  It really makes you feel like you are creating a drug empire and it is incredibly addicting.  The gameplay is awesome the shooting mechanics work great much better than any of the GTA games. This is one of the funnest games to shoot people in and the chainsaw is really awesome.  This probally the funnest open world game i have ever played to drive in.  The cars handle great and are a blast to drive.  The graphics look great and the particle effects are truly awesome.  This is a must get game
When I first played this game I was shocked. Just of how good a stealth game could actually be. Its realistic in its ways that you can hide in the shadows and use the enviroment to take out your enemies. Its really fun also, suspense is one of the main things that happens in this game. You only use two guns during the whole game, the pistol and the rifle that has attachments. Good stuff. All you need is that, and you can take out a whole building full of enemies. You have to crouch, and move slowly so the enemy doesnt see you. A very realistic game and im happy that this series of games got released. I highly recommend this game. Great storyline, and the last level is hecka hard!
What else needs to be said. Even with a low-end Graphics card this Masterpiece is FUN! Perfect combination for a laptop/notebook. Too bad Sir William Gates won't allow a PC version of Halo 2. Well anyways seeya in Halo 3 Deathmatc
From the commercials, Max Payne was a third-person shooter with a twist; the twist being able to kill mobsters, junkies and mercenaries in slow motion. Truly, one gets hooked on being able to leap backward in slow motion whilst rapidly firing dual handguns to put the kibosh on those that are trying to do the same to you.Aside from the slow-mo, Max Payne is essentially a third-person shooter whereupon you take control of the title undercover cop turned anti-hero, Max Payne. The story unfolds dramatically as you delve into the game. The jist of it is Max's wife and baby were brutally murdered by junkies and he's on the hunt for revenge. The plot widens, thickens and nearly bursts as you progress through the game. One can never tell who truly is on Max's side until the moment the credits roll at the end.The bottom line is this game is very much based on the slow motion "bullet time". Gunfights would be nearly impossible without the ability to slow them down to aim and fire with apt precision. That brings about the issue with controls. One of the cons of the game are the controls. Many times have I fallen off balconies and ledges due to the analog stick making Max move just so to the right. The heavy load times can also add to the agony, especially when after over a dozen tries one still cannot overcome the obstacles in your way.The game is definitely run on a sliding scale. The chapters start out a cake-walk and progress to a veritable teeth-grinder. At one point, I was so fed up and enraged by the game that I had to go outside and take a walk. If, however, you can take the time out to relax, focus and be patient, you should have little problem with the game. As for guns - there are lots of them. And more ammo than you can handle. Oftentimes you'll find a gun you really like and stick with it, in the process having to leave ammo behind on the corpses of your enemies. That being said, guns don't hold as much ammo as one would want, especially given the fact there is a huge surplus of ammunition abounds. Max also chews up painkillers like chocolate chips in order to heal himself - proof that he's not a guy to be messed with!I, personally, was very much hooked on it. The cutscenes are treated in a comic book style with dialogue and inner-soliloquies lifted from a Dashiell Hammett novel. However, simply put, one will either love or detest this game. I was reeled in by it, but am very glad I've beaten and seen the end of it. However, if you just cannot get enough Max Payne, there are two additional difficulty settings unlocked after beating it along with a third, even harder setting unlocked after those.The game was in parts extremely easy and in other parts extremely challenging. I wouldn't recommend picking this game up unless you're ready for oftentimes graphic violence, innuendo and potty-mouthery. I also wouldn't recommend picking up this game if you're not ready to be put on the verge of ripping your hair out in frustration. It is, however, conquerable and you'll very much be pleased once you do overcome the challenges
the wavebird can really take a beating. there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine. plus the game that ip[lay all the time is Super Smash Bros. Melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing. I also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that i wish was on the wavebird. After 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery. its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this. but overall its a great controlle
Star Wars KOTOR 2 is a decent game overall and well worth playing if you like good RPG's. It starts off much stronger then the first game and has a very similar mid game. I felt that the end game was weaker when compared to the first but still very decent
Like 90% of the people who played this game, my primary motivation for playing through was to watch a mini season of 24. The story takes place during the considerable gap of time between the 2nd and 3rd seasons of the show. With the actors from the show voicing their characters and the music and script written by the guys who work on the real show, it should not have been too hard to please me with this game. And in that respect, the game fulfilled, but did not exceed, my expectations. While I enjoyed watching this extra "day", the gameplay left a lot to be desired. There was quite a bit of variety, which was nice, and you get to play as almost every character from the show. There were so many different types of missions that the standard "get from point A to point B while shooting people" missions only made up about 60% of the game. The rest of the game involved driving, computer hacking, interrogating, sniping, and such. This would be really cool if all these missions were actually fun. Pretty much any mission involving driving sucked, since the controls were incredibly sloppy. Interrogation was kind of fun the first time, but it didn't need to be done several times. There were three or four different computer hacking missions that got done over and over again, so that they weren't much fun by the end of the game. As for the rest of the game, I'd describe it as mediocre. There wasn't anything spectacular about the gameplay; there were too many missions where the environment was so dark that it was impossible to see where I was going; and there was no reason at all for there to be two missions that involved shooting down a helicopter. In addition, there were too many missions that were unnecessarily difficult, in my opinion. In one such mission, you are playing as Jack and you have to defend a girl who is defusing a bomb. There is basically an endless supply of terrorists who keep rushing out and start shooting at you, and if the girl takes any damage at all she starts whining and stops working. It wouldn't be nearly so annoying if it weren't for the fact that there doesn't seem to be any strategy whatsoever to beating the mission. I must have made a dozen attempts with varying degrees of success. I have no idea what I did differently when I finally beat it. Pretty much any mission that involves you protecting another person is extremely annoying, because that person will usually tend to stand out in the open taking damage instead of finding cover. And despite the fact that your partner is firing their weapon constantly, they never hit a single enemy, so you have to take everyone out yourself.In all, the game is worth playing through for the story if you're a fan of the show. Otherwise, you could find much better action games out there
The introduction ISN'T boring, it ISN'T long, and it IS one of the best introductions to a game made by Enix/SE.  If you don't like the omg 25 min to wste on into2111!!!1, then don't buy another RPG for as long as you live.  RPGs are supposed to have stories, and this one is no different.  If you don't like it, take it back and get a refund... don't play RPG's like this if you can't stand words.  Go play some GTA or something--- oh wait, theres words in that too
This is the second Elder Scrolls game I've played, the first being Oblivion. I really enjoyed Oblivion and decided to give this one a try, and I must say I've really enjoyed it so far. Still on the main quest, though right now I'm gonna join the Morag Tong. Now first off, if you're an impatient type, or really easily confused, then this game is not for you. This game takes time and patience to really enjoy. One thing I did when I first started playing; I paid attention to what people said and went where I was told to go. I know it's a game that really gives you freedom to do what you want, but for someone just starting out on the series, just follow the main quest line and make sure to pay attention to what people say, and just go where you need to. Then, once you've become more accustomed to how things work, then I'd suggest exploring some. You'll often come across people on the roads with quests they'll want to give you that'll often deviate from your current objective. I would actually suggest helping them out, as the journal is often enough to get you back on track afterwards. Just remember to stay on the roads, and look at every sign you come across so you know which way to go. In closing, if you have patience and are willing to put some serious time into the game, then I'd suggest getting this. It's an older game, and the graphics are clearly outdated, but it can be quite an enjoyable experience. In fact, I'm liking it more than Oblivion, which had my attention for a few months. No telling when I'll be done with this one
This isn't much like the spiderman games that i'm used to, but it is definitely a lot of fun. Good storyline for a fighting game. The single player is challenging (but beatable) and uses most if not all the characters. There are plenty of characters, and most are different and have unique powers. There are two versus modes: against the computer or against a friend. The computer is pretty easy to beat. Each character has it's own pros and cons. Another thing i like is that the character levels aren't the same (anybody remember super smash bros?). In most games there are a lot of different people but they're mostly the same and your winning mostly just rides on your experience with their moves. In this there are some major strong characters unlocked at the end. I actually got bored and a little dissappointed after playing this a couple of days, but a little while ago i started playing again and it is awesome. recommended for comic book fans
For all you non-believers out there, BUY THIS GAME! I was like you...reading the reviews, looking at the box in various stores, pondering, considering, thinking to myself, "should I buy this game?" Now that I finally spent the mere $20 and played the game, I am wondering why I didn't do so sooner. As an avid Playstation supporter, (Stood in line for hours and paid over $600 for my PS2 back in the day), this game contains nearly flawless gaming entertainment. Cinematically driven storyline, supurbly coordinated character control, creative levels and character design, great soundtrack, decent bosses, pretty cool power moves, and, (importantly), puzzles are not overly frustrating to the point of throwing your controller through the TV screen...except for maybe climbing the rotating spike columns. In closing, all I gotta say is the same thing I said my first sentence of this review...BUY THIS GAME
This game is awesome. I love to play it, and i play it everyday. In school it gets me way far ahead, and much quicker too at math. The only thing that puts the game at a rate of overall 4 stars is that in one of the games you have to speak out, and sometimes it won't take your answer. this happens sometimes, but it kind of stinks because your getting tested, so when it won't take it it counts it as wrong. But i gotta say don't let this little thing stop you from buying this game. It will kill alot of time. On long trips i always take it, and whenever i get to my destination im like man i spent over two hours playing the ds? It totally rocks! i used to get car sick because i was bored, and just sitting in the car, but now i don't get car sick at all, because im doing something else. This game has made me good, and quick at math in my school. It really helped. This game is definitely good for all ages even my dad plays it!
I bought this game a bit late (2 years after It came out)but it still seemed state of the art to me! Loved the story, and gameplay has improved significantlyPros--HUGE MAP, with 5 massave areas to explore-TONS of vehicles- you might not see the same one twice!-Cool new features, like vehicle customization-Endless stuff to do!-multiplayer modeCons--character customization prosess can be annoying-If you leave the game on without pausing, you could be in for a bad supprise when you come back (ie, all your muscle going down)Go buy this game, you will really like i
Had this game on our gamecube, so addicting then, now we have it on our DS and it is just as much fun. Only downside to it is it can be confusing as to how to unlock all the stuff.  You have to get a certain rating I believe, like A-D, nonetheless it is a great game, worth the money! If you have kids, the kids will thoroughly enjoy
Though I was daunted a little by the reviews stating problem with installing the game I went for it and I don't regret. I bought the Platinum Edition and it installs all right. The good thing about the platinum edition is that you get three games at the same time.        Would not say it's one of the very bests available in its category but it's interesting and fun. About graphics, though the details are not great, still I liked the 3-D view, specially the view through the eyes of the main character(Hero).       Story is so so. Dialogs are specially bad. But the fact that you have to follow certain clues and talk to people and find out useful information is good idea. A sort of combination of RPG and RTS.             I like the units and the way they fight. Also picking up artifacts or weapons is good.         Overall it's a nice game. And the platinum edition is specially good as you get lots of hours of gameplay
The price of the card is about $7-$10 cheaper than in the stores, but what is the point if you have to pay $10 shipping (Express) or about $7 (Office Depot), who are the ones that are shipping you this card and not Amazon.  This much to ship a tiny card and thin packaging is a joke. 
This collection isn't as bonus feature happy as Anthology was. this version of FF4 (2 in the USA at the time of the SNES/Genesis era) hasn't changed that much. the random battle loading screen is like the SNES version, the switch between field/world map to the character menu while loading is fast as hell (while sadly Chrono Trigger is slower than the 2 FF games for the Anthology collection and even slower than the other Final Fantasy games for the PSone Era (7,8,9)) Chrono Trigger has a lot of bonus features for this version. Squaresoft (at the time) put a S*** load of cinemas (mainly ending cinemas), has a list of music from the game, and other stuff. The gameplay is still the same, with the exception of what I said earlier, which is good otherwise. unlike Anthology, this collection has no bonus music CD (for those who care anyway). this is still worth owning anyway
My friend told me it was unbelivably fun and said if u like a good laugh It`s a MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is my first experience with Sim City.  I've never played with the earlier versions.  Important Note:  The computer prompts you to type in the code that is in the white box in the lower left part of back of the CD case.  Well, I looked and looked, and it wasn't where the prompt said it would be.  After five minutes of thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me, I finally found the code.  It's on the back of the owners manual located inside the CD case.  You'll find it at the very top of that back cover of the manual, not in the lower left corner.The tutorials are helpful, so if you're new to all of this I highly recommend you go through those first.  And if you feel you need to go through them again, you can reset the tutorials to start fresh all over.I'll built a small city, and I've only had this game for a day, but I know I'm going to love it.
I had similar difficulties with this hi-def adapter. For one thing, the plugs were nearly impossible to get into the sockets. And once I did get them on, all I got was a black screen. But thanks to a friend, I figured out what the problem was:If you're having trouble getting those Monster cables attached (and who hasn't?), you should get a DeoxIT ProGold Kit by Caig. It's just two very small cans of stuff that help clean off your connectors and, more importantly, act as a temporary lubricant. I got my kit at Radio Shack. I think it was about twelve bucks.As for not getting any picture at all, that was my fault. I didn't realize that two of the sets of inputs on my TV are for 1080i only. Once I moved the plugs to the proper jacks, and turned off the signals that did not apply in my Xbox dashboard, the picture was sharp and bright.The cables are good quality. My only problem with them is that proprietary digital audio connector. It's kind of lame of Monster to require you to buy their special optical cable that comes with the right adapter. Other than that, if you've got the cash, get these cables, and that Caig kit
5 stars is a very low number compared to how good this game is.  Light jak is freakin awesome, after awhile u really get attached to this game and of course the charchters themselves.                        A MUST BUY FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR A NON-STOP ACTION GAME
It's a very good product but it only can be shipped within U.S., so I can't buy i
I bought this game not as a video game but so I could have my own personal trainer without paying for a gym membership.  I am two weeks into my 12 week routine and I LOVE it.  The software is very well done and it really does have "real time feedback."  If I'm leaning forward when I'm not suppose to while doing an exercise the trainer will say "try standing up straight."  I am definitely getting a great work out.  10 more weeks and I'll let you know if it did any good or not.  So far it seems to be helping.  I love that it builds on itself so that by week 12 you are doing more routines that are more intense.  The one drawback is the camera is really sensitive - I have to make my kids leave the room because if they walk around in the background it picks up their movements and lowers my score.  If you hate the gym but have always wanted your own personal trainer "Kinetic" seems to be the way to go
There is so much to see and discover in this game. It took me over 70 hours just to complete the walkthrough and I am still working on capturing all the monsters for the Monster Arena. Someone who wanted to complete all side quests, find all special items, etc. could easily spend more than 100 hours on this game and never get bored -just incredibly deep gameplay. The graphics are also outstanding, among the best I have seen in a video game. It took me awhile to get used to the Sphere Grid used to increase your characters' stats. At first I didn't find it as satisfying as the typical method of "leveling up". But eventually I began to enjoy it and it's now one of my favorite aspects of the game. The only thing I found tiresome was how long the cutscenes were. The storyline itself was quite good. But I wish it was told with shorter cutscenes or at least gave players the option to skip through the cutscenes. Still this is a minor complaint to an otherwise excellent game. Definitely worth buying!
This title is the tre sequel to Railroad Tycoon. If you loved the old 1990's original, you'll enjoy this one as well. Only con to the game is replayablity, which is very limited
The Destroy All Humans series is brilliant. With #2, you are now in the 1960s, with hippies and KBG agents all around you.If you didn't play the original Destroy All Humans games, it involved grey, big-eyed aliens coming down to earth in the 1950s. You ran around reading their thoughts, taking over their minds, and slaying them. Half of the fun was the incredibly funny sense of humor in the game as you interacted with these humans of the 50s.With Destroy All Humans 2, we jump forward to the 1960s. The President of the US (JFK) was apparently a female-loving space alien. The KBG realize this and try to help out. The next thing you know, the aliens are on attack again - and you're in charge. You run around city maps, watching as hippy chicks shout out "Back off, Pig!" and reading their minds. You can mentally throw objects, take over bodies, and much more.This game is much more "active" than other adventure games - you have to hammer on buttons to get actions to occur. You can't just passively press one button and be all set. The graphics are great. You really get immersed into the world of the 60s, with the appropriate cars, the hippy vans, the murals painted on walls. The outfits people wear are super. There are the traditional items to collect, objectives to achieve and people to slay. But again, most of the fun is in what you hear along the way. The commentary is hilarious. The thoughts you overhear can get you laughing out loud.If humans happy to see you doing something "alieny", you can zap them with free love - and the daisies dancing in their brain, along with the hippy music, will soon distract them from any troublesome thoughts of grey aliens.Even better, if you have a friend come and visit, you can do co-op play! Now, there are a few anachronisms - didn't "Love the One you're With" come out in 1970? Or maybe they're saying Stephen Stills got his inspiration from a hippy dude named The Freak. In any case, I'm sure Destroy All Humans 3 will be set in the 70s, so we'll get enough of that soon enough. In the meantime, be sure to get your hands on this version, and help bring peace to the world
 If you have an RPG bone in your body, back in the days of paper RPG who didnt dream of a game where you could roam creepy tombs fighting the undead, finding magic loot, avoiding traps, all with near cartoon quality graphics.. Thats the game we all wanted. Now finally I believe this is the first game that fufills all aspects of what all RPG'ers envisioned in a game. The world is free-form, the enemy creatures are well animated and pose a challenge in combat, all the characters dialogue is real speech. Theres a strong and challenging main quest to complete. As well you can take your character on many twists and turns. Want to be a professional thief, you can do it. Want to be a murderer and do hits, you can.(shame on you). Want to be a good guy and help out people you can.  The gameworld itself is massive, you can trapse across the gorgeous(and sometimes dangerous) countryside, crossing rivers, mountains, grassy plains. The seasons change and the stars light up at night, it really is graphically amazing.  Thats where it pays to have a top of the line PC, the graphics are amazing so you better have a current system. You can get by with say a Athlon 3000xp and a 9800pro but with part prices so cheap why would you want to? Not Doom3, not Halflife 2, not Prey, this is the game thats pressing people to upgrade their machine. And with Athlon 64's and 16 pipe 256mb graphics cards fairly cheap i'd say its worth upgrading just to play this game. I have an Athlon 64 4000 and a 256mb x800xl and I run the game at 1024x768 at high detail. The game ran well but in some outdoor locations and in combat when things got busy it would slow down a bit, so I dialed back the draw distance a bit and the plant draw distance and now everything is almost always very smooth.(I think plant draw distance is one of the easiest things to dial back to get more FPS without sacrificing visual quality).  I really cant do this game justice in a review, I am at a loss for words to fully convey this games greatness. However I will say if you have even a tiny love of paper or computer RPGs this game is for you. If you enjoy final fantasy type games the freedom in this game will bowl you over. If you like the idea of a free form fantasy world you will want to get this. In fact I have a hard time imagining anyone with the proper computer to run this game not liking it. Though if I had to imagine someone who wouldnt its someone who hates stories, cant be bothered with dialogue and simply wants to blast things for hours. But they have Doom 3 so they're happy too.
If you already have an Eye Toy and your favorite game on it is Beat Freak, then you have to get Eye Toy Groove.  The 28 tracks on it cover 40 years of great dance music, from Elvis to Good Charlotte.  As a 46 year old woman, I got this as an alternative of boring, repetitive workout tapes, with great success - the game even has a calorie counter built in.   This is also a fun game for me to play with my three kids, ages from 8 to 16.   Even the preschoolers I occasionally babysit enjoy the special effects in the chill out room, and the lyrics in all the songs are suitable for family listening, which is more than I can say for Dance Dance Revolution
Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus is said to be the last spin off (aside PSP's Crisis Core), and the one that goes furthest into the future of the VII world. The game seems like a must-play for Final Fantasy VII and Vincent Valentine fans alike, and it is. Thinking, most of those fans probably play mostly RPGs, this game is relatively easier than popular FPS (shooters) like Halo. Being an RPG-fan, yet still wanting to learn the story of the game, I was very happy for the easy difficulty (though it can be bumped up to something more difficult and there are plenty of extras that are difficult to get outside the story mode.) The controls are a little bad, but nothing that someone can't get used to. For one of Square's second or third shooter games, this one is pretty good.I'd recommend if you're doing what I did and playing it for story, then get the official guide so you can get all of the hidden capsules as you go (which unlocks the cutscenes and once you retrieve them, you never have to get them again). The guide is actually pretty good for this game, as well as the soundtrack. If you're a fan of the Final Fantasy music, definitely pick the soundtrack up.Lastly, if you're a Final Fantasy fan or RPG fan, get this game and everything related to it. It's worth it. I couldn't put this game down, even if some characters are a bit under-developed.If you're a shooter fan for games like Halo you will probably be disappointed
This game is fun- you get to pick a race car and run amok among cities.  You can even go the wrong way.  For me (older adult) it was fun to play with my kids, but I found it repetitive and boring after a while.  Of course my kids love the gamecube and really like this game
I put a great deal of interest in my purchases. With a lot of extra down-time at work and an internet connection, I find myself reviewing EVERYTHING before I buy it. And only after I am very impressed and convinced by many positive reviews will I take out my credit card. But this product, the Microsoft XBOX360 Media Remote, was one exception having read many bad reviews and deciding to purchase it anyway. Let me tell you...This remote is PERFECT if...1. You would like one, easy-to-use remote to control both basic TV and an Xbox 360 that doubles as your DVD player.2. The only buttons you would need for the TV are: Channels, Volume (TV speaker/output control only), Numerical channel input, Muting, *INTPUT SELECTION* (yes, it CAN switch between your TV's inputs), Return (to toggle between 2 TV channels), and Power.3. You do not need specialized/advanced buttons found on a OEM remote or advanced learning remote for the TV.4. You do not need to control a A/V receiver, DVD player (other than XBOX 360), or a digital cable box (Tivo, DVR, etc.)5. You are on a budget but would still like a quality remote.If you can say yes to all or most, then don't hesitate to grab one of these remotes. You will be completely satisfied. Especially with immediate access to the tactile DVD buttons versus the 360's annoying on-screen DVD navigation. For this feature it is almost worth the $30 alone.P.S.I also own a Logitech Harmony 880 for the living room which I highly recommend for anyone not fitting into the catagory mentioned above
This game is great for when you have a group of friends come over. It really breaks the ice between you and anybody you may not be familiar with and it is incredibly entertaining.  I suggest this game for everybody
  I have the original for the DS lite.  I thought that was fun, but this is better.  The first few chapters seem the same, but the gameplay is better.Twisting the bones is a new feature.  Repairing a compound fracture also new to me!This game is good because it could really help shape you kids minds and let them explore a simulation to see is practicing medicine would be a job they would like.BACK to the game.  I like that the NUNCHUK is the tool that lets you select your surgical instruments.  Having the patient displayed on a big screen is helpful too!  I do wish there was more talking though.  I thought they would upgrade that from DS, but hey didn't.  It's not a waste of money.  It's like tetris in that you either love or hate it!  If you like it, you won't be able to stop playing!
They're nice cards, I never had a problem. Since I had 3 PS2s in my house at the time, we kept mixing up memory cards or my brothers would steal mine... then my boyfriend bought me these and I always had my own memory cards, no one else could say they were theirs or anything else. The only problem I can think of is that they are a little expensive
I thoroughly enjoyed playing Final Fantasy VIII.  From the introductory movie I was hooked.  The world and story were very unique, as well as the new battle system.  I thought the junction system was fairly easy to understand and once I got used to it, I loved it more than the materia system of VII.  The characters in VIII were all very likeable.  It was interesting to play the game from the perspective of a student named Squall, who happens to be one of my favorite heroes of the Final Fantasy series.   The cinematics in the game were very nicely produced and captured the best moments.  From start to finish, I had fun playing this game and highly recommend it to fans of the Final Fantasy series and role playing games in general.   
This headset is probably the best xbox live recommended headset to date. Everything on the earpiece is adjustable to fit every size of ear. The big xbox live headsets are uncomfortable and begin to hurt after about a half hours use. Wearing the Halo 2 headset i actually forgot that I was even wearing it because it is so light. They have just released a new version of this headset that also comes the communicator with no difference in price. I greatly recommend this headset to anyone that plays xbox live on a regular basis
I ordered this set primarily for LOTR: Return of the King, but after I got it, it turns out my graphics chip was not powerful enough to play it. But I was able to play the other three games and I really enjoyed Freedom Fighters and Medal of Honor. Black and White was okay but I wasn't able to get into it. But it should be noted that with Black and White you get both the original game and the expansion pack Creature Isle. So you are really getting five games instead of four. So I highly recommend this set if you are want to play some good, but not so modern games and spend little money
I was a little late to the booming cult following that Phoenix Wright has acquired, having just bought the game this month. However, it did not dissapoint. I was always a fan of the point and click adventures on the PC but was dissapointed with Trace Memory, not so much that it was a bad game but it was soo short. I was hesitant to spend the money again on a game I could beat in about 10 hours time, but luckily I did. Phoenix Wright is one of those games that has enough challenge to it that you don't feel like you are breezing effortlessly through it, yet is open enough for younger players to be able to play and enjoy it as well. The length of the game is fairly long, with five cases to solve, each one becoming longer and more difficult as you play. I must say you really get into the characters in this game as each case is connected in some way to the others, and I really liked the last case that added the use of luminol and finger printing tools (makes you feel all CSI, and stuff ;) ). I look forward to the second one coming out soon, and definately recommend this as one of the best on the DS right now
This game has been out for a while. And I have been playing it for a long time now. Have I ever had a boring moment while playing GTA: SA? No... I honestly have cherished every moment of gameplay. Why? Because this game has so much content and capability, that it is not possible to dislike this game if you have actually sat down to play and appreciate it. People giving GTA: SA low ratings must be joking. CONTROL - Superb. When I want my character to do something, he does it, no questions asked. If I want to fire a gun at an enemy, I get to fire the gun without having to put up with errors or jams. If I want to hop in a car and take off, I get to do just that. CONTENT: This game is a vast improvement over even GTA III. There is so much to do, that it is impossible to ever get bored. Every second is entertaining... there is always something to work on and/or improve. Challenging missions are everywhere; and if you don't want to do missions you can go lift weights, build up your muscles... or you can go put some neat features/colors on your personal cars. RADIO: Good stations that have songs that cover just about any genre.GRAPHICS: Of course there is always room to make graphics better, but the graphics on this game were very good, despite there being so much on the disk. This game covers everything, and there is never really a let-down. If you haven't bought/played this game, I suggest that you do. It is worth every penny, and will keep you entertained for accumulated weeks at a time. Good luck
As the title suggests Sacred Underworld is pretty much the same as Sacred but a little better.  So if you like Sacred, Sacred Underworld is very well worth playing. 
I bought Paper Mario 2 for my neice to play when she comes over to visit, now she comes over to play the game.  It has an interesting story line and many characters to interact with.  The puzzles are only moderatly hard so she hasn't gotten stuck and lost interest, but the story is long enough that we haven't just breezed through it either.  It's better if you take so side trips to work the "missions" and fight in the arena (where you can build up your levels faster).  You can also revisit previous lands and re-fight the random encounters.  The only drawback to the game play is the long cut screens that you have to read.  The game flow would be better if there was an option to read these to you, like Super Monkey Ball 2.  I know, I know, educational aspect of reading yourself, but that's her parents job, not mine :)Game masters will find this way too easy but if you just want entertainment without getting stuck for long periods of time on puzzles then Parper Mario 2 will work for you.Well worth the $20 pric
Its Gran Turismo, theres really nothing more to say. I own all the titles in this franchise and I have never been disappointed with any one of em. The series is really amazing. With every new release it only gets better. People should also try Tourist Trophy which is setting another standard in moto racing. 
The XBOX 360 Live 12 month kit is the best deal for anyone who needs to sign up or renew their Live account, even if you do have the headset. The card itself is $50, and the points, bonus game, and $20 dollars off a new game (limited time offer) easily helps to make your money back. Even if they didn't include the rebate, it would still be less than buying these parts separate. In fact, it's almost like you're getting a headset for free!So, like I said, if you need live, buy.Also, this is the bundle which someone earlier stated was cheaper at Best Buy. I checked, and he was mistaking the card for the kit
Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is an action/RPG that features the largest roster of comic book characters ever seen in a video game. Players assume the roles of more than 20 Marvel Super Heroes including Spider-Man, Wolverine, Blade and Captain America, and through their actions determine the fate of both planet Earth and the Marvel universe ? revealed in one of multiple epilogues. Marvel: Ultimate Alliance offers total team customization, where players create their own team name, icon and vehicle, as well as establish their team reputation as they play throughout the story. Gamers also have the option to level up each character individually to their liking, or all team members at the same time to keep their heroes balanced. With the game's new combat system, players battle against the world's most notorious Marvel Super Villains in the air, underwater, and on the ground, using grappling, blocking and dodging moves, by charging up their Super Hero powers before unleashing them, and using environmental objects as one and two-handed weapons. Marvel: Ultimate Alliance features a storyline where the missions players accept, the objectives they complete, and their interactions with other characters throughout the game directly impact how the story plays out. 
Awesome game, loads of fun.All a guy needs: Women, Money, Cars, Power (not necessarily in that order :-)
Star Wars KOTOR 2 is a decent game overall and well worth playing if you like good RPG's. It starts off much stronger then the first game and has a very similar mid game. I felt that the end game was weaker when compared to the first but still very decent
I bought this game on PS2 for my daughter who is 12, and she has had a ball playing it. Though there are English subtitles because it is spoken in very fast Japanese, that doesn't take away from the game's adventures. The instructions given are very clear, and though it does take skill to master some of the tasks,  it really is quite enjoyabl
I have played all the rpgs, Baldur's Gate, NWN, Dungeon Siege, Final Fantasy, TOEE, etc.And I have to say, that stumbling upon Icewind Dale 2 was a real treat..Sure the graphics are dated, but WOW..the storyline, the dialogue, the descriptions of the rooms and actions are all incredibly well written (A breath of fresh air, after playing DS). The quests don't get in the way of the game, like so many others that get bogged down in annoying side-quests as a lame attempt to flesh out the world.  I would have prefered the game to be turn based like TOEE, but this game's battles are numerous and really fun; partially to good monster design..compare bugbears in this game to NWN..so much better, and partially to the unforgettable situations and dungeons. When pitted against other D&D ruleset games, the spell choices offered and levels they are given at is superior to all others.  I actually enjoyed having a Druid in my party, who could transform his arms into pythons, and for the first time in CRPG history actually used summon animals spells. Even if many spells were simular to other games, these felt more tailored to the characters and made useful, instead of waiting till higher levels to get one useful spell.My favorite part is that I could handpick my team, where as in Baldur's Gate I was forced to play with characters I didn't like, or NWN where it was removed and tedious to interact with henchmen.I enjoyed RPing the characters backgrounds, and interactions in my head, and really enjoyed finding the treasure, unique to  IWD2, like a wide variety of cut gems. (which became an addiction)If you updated this game graphically to the level of TOEE, and made it Turn Based with battle tactics, It would be my all time favorite RPG
Graphically, this game is a work of art. The shiny surfaces, glowing lightsabers, and vibrant colors make this a winner.As far as gameplay those, you can even forget the graphics! This gameplay is so good, you could play it with terrible graphics, and still have an aweseome time!The score by John Williams is another highlight. The music enhances the tension, action, and drama of this game.Overall, this is the best star wars game i have ever purchased or played
I first got this game about 2 years ago for computer.  Back then, I had a really slow computer, and it didn't work right.  I was so mad that I had wasted 40 dollars on it.  It went on the shelf and waited there for 2 years.  Now I have a better computer and play it all the time.  The earlier reviewer said that the game was extremely difficult, not so.  The guy must have obviously been a moron, and not been able to figure out the puzzles, because the game has an average difficulty, and if he wants it easier, he can play on Padawan.  Anyway, the game is basically a first person shooter based game, where you go around blasting storm troopers, probe droids, and more.  I suggest getting this game because I really enjoy playing it, and I want to get it for XBOX too
when i first saw the game for number 5 on top games. I new i wanted it. My littlwe bro like eww that game is horrible. I ask my grandma 2 buy it for me and it so fun. I lov it if u like games that r easy than play this on
Quite simply, it's great, though a bit on the challenging side.  Gorgeous art style and some great music come together for an atmospheric title, and one that, despite it's 'rated 'E' for everyone' approach, will appeal to adults as well as kids.  It's not without some light frustration, but the good far outweighs the bad.Ignore the mediocre reviews and pick this one up.  Replay value is in the four different cases, as well as some unlockable minigames and a 'touch' list.  If you like adventure titles like Phoenix Wright and Trace Memory (or Maniac Mansion, for that matter) then you'll really dig this game.A good solid four stars
This product is excellent. Has not malfunctioned like some other brands where info becomes inaccessible after some time.Good perfromanc
I've done most of the Nancy Drew games now, and a couple CSI and Law and Order games. Nancy Drew has better graphics and is actually harder in some cases than CSI. I also had so many problems with bugs with the CSI and Law and Order games, not so with Nancy Drew. And a real plus is my 7 year old can play them with me
My husband brought this game home and I thought, "Oh no, I guess we're not having multisyllable conversations for the next few weeks..." But to my surprise not only did he ABSOLUTELY love this game but I would sit next to him and watch, totally transfixed by the amazing detail and effort that the creators poured into this game. I caught myself saying, "Baby, aren't you going to play your game?" This game is incredible and while I am not at all a gamer I'm tempted to try it out! Everyone not shocked by gore (and I mean LOTS of gore) should play this game. Every game should be this well made.
Xenosaga II-Jenseits von Gut und Boese came in November to Europe and was the first Xenosaga, which was released here!!! But we European players never played Xenosaga I before, so Namco released the second Xenosaga in a great "Special Box". In this box was the game itself and a Movie-DVD with nearly all Xenosaga I movies. Back to topic, in my opinion Xenosaga II is a pretty game with cool movies and a battle system that makes fun.The music in this game was composed from Yuki Kajiura in the movies and Shinji Hosoe in the rest of the game. I think Kajiuras music is really good but Shinji Hosoe did a bad job, with his elevator music ;o)The graphics are okay but I couldn't see anything outstanding.In the end I must say, that Xenosaga II is a good RPG, even if it's not so wonderful than the first Xenosaga. That's the reason, why I imported Xenosaga I from your country ^_~ But at last the most PAL-players are happy, that actually (my dictionary doesn't give me the right English translation for "ueberhaupt" ;_; sorry) Xenosaga II come to Europe yet!!!!So I look forward to the third and last Xenosaga and hope, that this Episode will be like the first!!!!Many greets from Germany.....Viele Gruee aus Deutschland ^
I bought 2 of these controllers for my kids, because I didn't want cables in the middle of our Family Room nor did I want them sitting too close to the TV when they played.This controllers are excellent. They work perfectly, they are easy to store because of the lack of cables, the weight is fine for small children, the range of the signal is more than enough and they aren't battery eaters. I use them as well and they are wonderful.They are much better than the ones that comes with the playstations
At TGS (Tokyo Game Show) 2005, Sony of Japan announced that they were developing an original game for PSP: LocoRoco. Instead of the usual ports or re-creations or compliations of retro games, LocoRoco is a completely new venture. It focuses on a fictional planet where happy LocoRocos (yellow blobs) and MuiMuis (blue figures) live. One day, it is invaded by the Moja Troop, who eat LocoRoco. Your job is to tilt the surface to lead LocoRocos through their planet without getting eaten. You collect flowers, which gives you another LocoRoco. You can combine and separate LocoRocos, as well. You collect bugs as a food source for LocoRocos. Additionally, when you collect MuiMuis, you can get house parts.The game is very easy. As a PSP player of Tekken:DR, complicated combo moves and annoying nuisances with the analog stick make PSP games hard to play--especially ports that we're used to seeing on PSOne and PS2. With LocoRoco, you use 3 buttons during gameplay. The shoulder buttons (LEFT and RIGHT) are used to tilt, tapping the circle button separates LocoRocos, holding the circle button combines them, and holding down both shoulder buttons makes your LocoRocos jump. A lot easier said than done. A demo disc found at EBGames and a demo for download on the PSP Memory Stick show these capabilities and can be found for download at http://www.us.playstation.com/locorocopcdemo. You must have v2.71 for this to work, I might add.Besides a "career" mode, which pivots you into different courses with different color LocoRocos, there are "mini-games" like a Mui-Mui Crane, Chuppa game, and more. You must collect a certain amount of bugs/pickories every game to play these games. Also, there is the LocoRoco House Editor feature that allows you to create a house for your LocoRoco. I haven't yet tested it out but it is an excellent feature, I presume. By collecting MuiMuis in games, you get house parts and you can build a house for your LocoRoco.Besides all of the gameplay features, a large soundtrack is full of bubbly, interesting, and catchy jingles with unique voices. While some find it annoying, it is very catchy and it gets stuck in my head. LocoRocos even sing along in gibberish while the song goes on. MuiMuis do, as well. The graphics are 2D like Mario, which make loading times non-existant and shows off the capability of the PSP's high-performance graphics.In the end, LocoRoco is a game that is intuitive, simple, and beautiful to look at. It is fitted only for the PSP, and it should. Additionally, the gameplay is excellent, pivoting you into many different scenarios with many different characters (like Moja, who attack you or Chuppa, who catapults you into hidden areas). It is clearly worth $40--clearly.PROS-Intuitiveness and Simplicity: Easy to play, fitted for the PSPShows off PSP Graphic Capabilities: Beautiful to look atDifferent Maps, Characters, Colors: Very unique and freshNot a Port or Re-creation/compliation: A completely original gameNo Long Loading Times: 2D graphics prevents thisMini-Games: Lets you take a break from main gameplayCONS-Longevity: Only 40 levels makes you wish for more...Should've Used Characters More: Some characters pop up once...You have to pay money made in career to access mini-games5/5: FUN5/5: GRAPHICS5/5: GAMEPLAY4/5: PLAYABILITY19/20: TOTA
This game is great. Both the missions and the things you do on your own (like extortion) make this game an awesome part of anyone's collection. I only found one thing wrong with the game. When you reach the rank of "Don", everyone still talks to you as i you were at the bottom of the barrel. For instance, when talking to one of the corleone men, they will still say something like, "hey kid stay outta trouble". This game, although great, can still use a little fine tuning.
I unlike a lot of other people did not buy this game when it first came out.  My initial thought was what was Squar thinking.  I was thinking this could be nothing more than a childs game.  It wasnt until I talked to a number of other people, right before KH2 came out did i finaly listen to all those people and spend the $20 to get the game, (as was the price of the game by then,) and low and behold, by the time I finished watching just the opening scene I was hooked.  I played that game for what seemed like hours on in, (it was really only a very long weekend.) But that game became so addicting I immediatly went out and bought the second one the day it came out.  The story line was on par with that of Final Fantasy X, and Final Fantasy VII, my two favorit games in the world. I would recomend this game to anyone with even the slightes bit of imagination.  If you can even dare to dream you will instantly love this game as I did.  It was well worth the price, and my only regret is that i did not buy it sooner
This is a wonderful gift for any girl gamer.  I love mine
I have owned the first DS since the day it came out. I bought the DS Lite about a week after it came out and I was amazed of the changes. It is so much lighter and is just a lot better to have than the original. The screen emits about as much light as the sun. It is like DLP technology compared to a regular TV. Plus, most of the games look loads better. Sme people say there is a stress crack, but I have had mine since June and it is still in very good condition. My advice is to you to buy this DS Lite and you will have made a good choice
If you have always wanted a turn based strategy game in a fantasy setting with no limits then Dominions II is really the only option out there. Its not perferct but its darn good.The story, if you can really call it that, is that the world of Dominions once had one god. One day he just wasn't there all of a sudden and everybody and their brother decided to try and apply for his job. All of these "pretender gods" have to kill off all the other gods and put their religions out of commision in order to take over the world and become a true god. To start up a new game of Dominions II you need to choose from one of the 17 different empires and then pick your pretender god from dozens of different avatars. You can play as darn near anything you can imagine from the ordinary, like the arch-mage, to the outrageously exotic, like the fountain of blood. Every pretender god has strengths and weaknesses and some may be adept at only one or two paths of magic while others may learn many with ease. You also pick a castle and set up your own "dominion" which is the effect your god has on his followers as his religion spreads across the world. But that isn't all, you still haven't actually started a game yet. Next you have to create the game by picking from one of nearly a dozen huge maps and setting all of the game settings such as victory conditions and the difficulty of neutral provinces. And lets not forget, you also choose which of the 17 empires will be playing and if they will be human or AI players.The game itself is huge and has very few limits. Your empires unique units may be built in any province in which you have built a castle but every proince in the game also has its own units that may be built there to inculde many that none of the empires usually have access to. Plus units may be equiped with different armor and weapons and as such there may well be hundreds of unique units in the game with maybe even thousands of different equipment varaitions. Like the pretender gods, units come in a huge array from simple, like the light infantry, to the wild, like werewoles and vampires. Combine that with the fact that there are hundreds of spells in the game to research, hundreds of magic items to forge and find, and random events almost every turn, no two games will ever end the same way and the game has nearly unlimited replyability.Combat is a bit unsual. All units, in order to move around the map or attack, have to be assigned to a commander. Commanders are built in the same way you recruit normal units but they can only lead so many men. However, you can assign units under a commander to as many squads as you like and each squad as well as the commander himself can be issued a specific order such as casting spells, using ranged weapons or attacking certain foes on the battle field. The downside of all this is that you have to set up all of this before hand during your turn. Combat occours in between turns and you have no control over the battle. Its entirely up to your units to follow the plan you laid out for them.For better or worse this system is certainly original.But some things about the game really bother me. My biggest complaint with the game has to be the computer AI. Its not thats its too stupid or too smart. Its actually a bit like the terminator, it allways seems to know where you are and sends wave after wave of seemingly endless foes after you. It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargined with and it won't stop until one of you is dead. With no diplomacy options and units like spys, assassins and scouts being extremely rare and expensive most games aginst the AI just deteroiate into massive rushing attacks with huge armies killing each other over and over with gods throwing spells at each other turn after turn.Another problem with the game is the manual which is huge but contains no information that isn't easily available in the game. Its the same problem Evil Genius had, the manual is awful and all the hints that should hae been in the manual are hidden in the games loading screens. I hope you can read fast. The grapics obviously aren't exactly on par with Half Life 2 or Doom 3 but they work, however I've got to take issue with the music and sound which is downright AWFUL. You better get used to hearing the same three music tracks over and over. Over all, Dominions II is by far the best turn based fantasy game I've ever played. Room for improvement is obviously here but this game should keep you occupied for a long time
This WiiPoints card, which is the equivalent of $20, allows one to purchase and download games from the Wii's virtual console, part of the Wii Shop channel. Already, at launch, 12 games throughout the history of gaming were available, including Pinball (Nintendo Entertainment System), Sonic the Hedgehog (Sega Genesis), SimCity (Super Nintendo Entertainment System), and Super Mario 64 (Nintendo 64). Nintendo is planning to add new games every Monday, to come to a total of 30 by the end of the year. Beyond that, "new classics" are coming throughout 2007 such as Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars (Super Nintendo), and Mario Kart 64 (Nintendo 64). Many of these games can be controlled with the included Wii Remote or the backwards-compatible GameCube controllers. Some require the Wii Classic Controller, but a great number use the other two aforementioned control methods
I can't believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars.  You are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one, but unfortunately, if you live in the country like me, finding a store nearby selling Playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible.  So you're forced to shop for one online.It's REALLY not cool to have to pay all this money *just* to save the progress in my video game.  It's really dumb. 
This game when released was the best 1st person shooter console game available. But today with  doom and half life versions for xbox, there is actually something to compare halo to, and it doesn't stand up. First off, the plot is utterly pointless. I never felt invested or sympathetic to master chief, just frustrated when he died that I would have to replay a section.The weapons are lame. Released after the PC version of quake iii, halo's weapons seem limp in comparison. None of the "futuristic" aspects seem particularly believeable or useful, for that matter.The vehicles suck. Driving the vehicles in Halo is as fun as operating a forklift, which is actually quite entertaining in GTA san andreas, so maybe it is not quite that fun. I guess it is more like driving that "super action wacky bike" from the southpark "chimpocoman " episode.2 player story mode rules! the best part of the game and the only reason to reccomend it is it is a great game to play with a friend.multiplayer deathmatch is average. Give halo props for the first decent multiplayer battle for xbox, but it wasn't as good as it's PC competition when it came out- The much older quake III still looked and played better- and now seems OK but no better than most.That said the 2 player campaign and multiplayer make this a good 10-15$ diversion, just don't expect the immersive atmosphere of doom III or the intriguing plot twists of half life, 
Brings back the good old days of playing these games after school
The game when you first buy it is awsome. i mean who wouldent want to throw cars at helicopters, make people fly 20 yards with your finger, and bunt-kick a police car down 5 blocks? the game lasts a bit because of the "smash smash get some cash" gameplay (the more smash points you get, the more moves you get). the moves are the best part. at one point in the game, you get a move that lets you grab onto a helicopter or a big boss. i always loved riding the helicopter to 5th street... its alot better then skateboarding on a  bus if you ask me. anyway, once you get all the moves and beat the story mode AND get the canadian boxers, it gets extremely repetitive.at the end of the game, when you get critical alert status, the same guys always come.5/5 stars for the first 3 weeks-2 months... 4 the next month, and basically declining to 3BUT, whenever you are board and have nothin to do, no good tv is on, all of your friends are offline and every other game is getting booring, its nice to take a good ol trip back to this game and smash a mech or to.. you know, for old times sake
When I upgraded to the 360 I was a bit saddened that I would not be able to use my controller with a built in fan, but these wireless controllers are amazing. First, wireless. No tangling, no mess, toss your controller wherever, pick it up, walk around, sounds a bit unnessacary, but it is definatly nice to have.Also, the middle "x button" of these new controllers is amazing also(although, I'm sure they're on the wired controllers) quick access to your music, friends, and dashboard in game. Plus, turn off the controller or the whole console from the comfort of your couch
When it comes to the GC/GBA Cable.  You wouldnt think that something this inexpensive could make a difference in the way you play video games.  But it does it unlocks secrets of all kinds in Gamecube games, sometimes it gives you access to secret areas/maps/items and various other thing.Depending on the game and what features it opens up.  Plus it is cheap to get and once you've gotten this wonderful item.  You will wonder why you didnt get it sooner.  I know from my own experience. 
I have all the "Grand Theft" games and this is one of my favs.I highly recommend it and all the others.I recently purchased "Liberty City" Awesome
Final Fantasy III, as most may know, was the only Final Fantasy game that failed to reach North America.  Well now it haas been revived, and it's better than ever before!The "improved"1)  Final fantasy has pushed the DS's graphics to the limit.  Though the figures may not be crystal clear, and though it may seem slightly pixelish, it's probably the best you'll ever get for the Nintendo DS.  FFIII is completely 3D, a step up from it's original, and the character changes appearence as you change his/her job!2)  The job system is what solely drives this game.  As some may have read, yes, there are 279841 different party combinations.  Obviously, this opens up many doors and many strategy.  FFIII incorperates these 23 jobs in a smart way as well.  Don't be suprised when some job adjustments must be made to defeat a certain boss.  Your party can be all fighting, or all magic, all range, or all skills, or a mix of any!  Jobs are earned when crystals are discovered, and you will find a use for each of them.3)  FFIII can be played entirely with the touch screen, or entirely with the buttons, so you can use either method whenever you want.  FFIII complements the DS's touch screen capability quite nicely; being able to use it to select moves is much better than the buttons.4)  FFIII is also Wi-Fi compatible.  In it, players can send messages to other players global, using an internet port.  It isn't much, but it's something!5)  You may name all of your characters, and play as any or them, any time!  I like that freedom.The things that could be better...1)  The story line is very redundant, and a copy of previous FF games.  It isn't a big deal, but you'd think tthey'd get a bit more original!2)  The command buttons during battle are very small, so using the touch screen often makes you mis-hit a command.3)  This game requires lots of patience, because the battles are very tedious sometimes, and most gameplay is spent traing.4)  Each job doesn't have a variety of skills, but rather only one.  It gets very old once you maintain the same job for a long time.5)  THe Wi_Fi isn't very creative, and there is no 2 player in FFIII.6)  FIghts do not incorperate time bars.  That is to say, you can take 5 years to make a move without an attack from an enemy.To make it short and sweet...Die hard FF fans must get this game, mainly to complete their FF colections, but also for a great time.  Not a die hard fan?  No worries.  The RPG is the best you'll find on the DS or PSP.  It's got plenty to do, and won't fail you at any time.  Those who don't enjoy strategy games, however, or do not have the patience to grow their characters may want to stay away from this game.I loved it, but hey, it's just what I think.This review was brought to you by the son of Having Fun
Really nice headset except for the fact that if your a gamer that spends alot of time on Xbox Live with this headset on it can start to hurt a little bit. You can adjust the volume from barely being able to hear the person or basically to making it seem like they are yelling. Very small and it does plug into the charger very well if someone says that they have to hold it in with a rubber band or tape then they messed it up somehow because the headset stays in nice and firm. This is a MUST for people that cannot stand a cord getting in their way for their headset on xbox live or XB Connect/Xlink. It has VERY good range (i can walk outside with the door closed about 50 or so steps away and i still get reception.) Overall if you have a Xbox and want to talk to other people online get this headset it is very nice
I have to say this is a game that was worth every dollar spent!   It's a game that I will keep for life and probably play again someday! I don't know what the previous Final Fantasy games were like so for me there is no comparison. I think I'm totally biased toward Final Fantasy X. The two coolest aspects about this game, for me, are the Aeons and Blitzball. The other thing I like about this game is the storyline, the characters and the beautiful scenary. I forgot to mention how great the music is also. I've been reading reviews about current and previous Final Fantasy games and the thing that is still missing for me is, the Aeons and Blitzball. I'm also attached to the characters in Final Fantasy X. Even the sequel doesn't cut it for me right now. For me, it's Final Fantasy X all the way
Story (10/10):Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic puts you in a world of complete bliss and utterly fantastic awe. This is not just a shoot-em-up game, for within the millions of pixelated characters lies a story. A story with jaw-dropping, mind-blowing twists and turns and conclusions awaiting. Choose your path, for the first time, you can choose your own destiny rather than the creators. This game is not just one plot, nor is it a mindless adventure trekking the whereabouts of the middle of nowhere looking for purpose. No, this game is many a quests and riddles, illusions and games inside to keep the gamers on their tippy-toes at all times. Starting out as a mysterious rebel who does not know his/her own past, fight or peacefully sneak your way through the depths of several planets, each carrying many people with many stories. You may help these people, you may be there savior and deny a reward, or you may bash their helpless heads into their skulls to create your path to the dark side. All the while making the venture across native lands toward beoming a Jedi, encounter friends, enounter foes and convert them to friends if you ever so wish. It doesn't matter, because in the end it's only you facing the evil sith lord, toe to toe, lightsaber to lightsaber. Gameplay (9/10):The fighting system is somewhat random, but not entirely, you can choose to create a concrete combat fighter or a wizard casting spells such as lighting, wind, life draining, lightsaber throwing, etc. Many different various skills such as stealth, persuasion, even computer hacking and lockpicking (Sort of).You can stay close using lightsabers, one in each hand or a double-bladed one. Or you stray afar using blaster rifles and pistols. You have many compainions, droids, jedis, dark side mercenaries and wookies, each with a charming, dramatic, or brutal life story, which will only be concluded as the game furthers on. Very impressive dialogue and screenwriting, graphics and realism are also mediocre. I can guarantee, with the low $20 price, this game will give you hours of fun, each day, for at least a month. And trust me, when that month is up, you will not want to get rid of it, you will get the urge to play it again because once you start this game you are hooked on a long-term engagement. The only thing I find wrong with this game is it's sequel.Pros: ~ Excellent sound, effects, dialogue, screenplay, scenery, designing and story writing. ~ Hundreds of weapons, armor, with belts, gloves, arm bands, implants and masks to further increase skills.~ Hundreds of side quests with extravagant rewards and conclusions that will keep you in awe all day long. ~ No wondering from world to world in search of plots, they are usually easy to find but challenging (not boring) to accomplish.~ No matter what, you can always play the game a different way, so you would be just beginning your quest as soon as you beat the game. ~ Neat little area from xbox live downloadable content, which can open up another plot and give you VERY nice weapons and two new lightsaber colors. (Turquoise, orange)~ You can change the overall game difficulty, it's default setting is medium. Cons:~ No type of multiplayer games in any circumstance. It's surprising they didn't make a co-operative option.~ Sometimes annoying loading transitions, can take maybe 10-15 seconds at most. I'd advise having some music handy if it's your 2nd or 3rd time through the game
This game is very fun and has lots of action that is for sure.  Many people may find this good enough for the game to satisfy them, but I am not one of them.  The mythology part is good and the creatures and gods are described and portrayed very well, but the plot to the campaign messes it all up.  The last campaign was much larger and it was more fun.  I was disappointed in the new campaign.  I'd say the first one is better.  If you make a big deal about graphics though, than this game is for you.  It has excellent graphics and features.  The ocean and mountain looks so realistic.  They do a good job showing you underwater.  These graphics blow away the graphics of the Age of Empires series.  If you were expecting a good campaign, your not going to be very happy.  Plot isnt so good and its very short.  It has about half of the other games campaigns.  A big difference is that in normal games the titans always come out.  They're kind of annoying.  Overall this game is good but not as good as the prequal.Graphics-10/10Campaign Plot-3/10Music-6/10Mythology-9/10Overall-7/10
I very much enjoyed this game and I think it may be my favorite X-BOX game I own!I Kinda agree with the person that said that this game was pretty short,but it does not make it any less better!One funny part about this game is the part where you are Sunny for the first time in the game and have to jump to each pipe and the whole time she is just sitting there laughing her head off!I reccomend this game for people that like games that are fun,educational,and very durable

We purchased this DVD because we really need to work with our son on his reading and it's a great supplement to reading books.  He loves this DVD and we love the variety in it's approach.  We didn't realize until we watched it with our kids that so much of what we viewed as children really stuck with us through the years
My son was over 2 before we introduced BE videos.  There are definitely those which cater to the younger baby with lots of random images, but this one is great in that it has puppet shows with a little plot, as well as discrete integrated units for each of the seasons.  Unlike some of the other BE's with random visuals, here the visuals truly support the learning objective desired.  Concur with other reviewers as well that this is the most robust BE video in Bonus Features. It has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the seasons.  And no I didn't care for the commercial either...
saw the trailer online and knew I'd love it on dvdI was rightlaughed my ass off 8 times after watching itso many times of the 8 times I watched it that isit is sad Tucker couldn't be in this one and last Friday movie but it's still greatthe new cast members add more humor just as much the ones in the second and first Friday moviesthe plot is deepermore twistedmore funnymore senselessespecially with Day Dayi laughed so hardthe extras are worth itCube is great at making filmsso no one slam himhe is an amazing film makerconsidering he used to star in movieswhen he can star in one and create itthat's more then geniousthat's innovativehe does good at starring and making moviesgive him props peopleand you can't always please everyone with what you makeremember thatI loved this one. and will get the other 2 movies on dvd when I can. the scenes are just hilarious and priceless like the other Friday movies. so glad i bought this on dvd. give it a chance people.
This is a great movie that everyone should see. I'm a Conservative and so are all of my friends and they love this movie. We don't see this movies as a "Republicans are Bad movie" thats dumb. This movie is just what a movie should be, funny and entertaining. We all LOVE the songs because they are not only great, but true too
I really enjoyed this DVD-and all of the combos were doable with great breakdowns.The instructor actually starts with the left foot , so you can follow her mirror image.I teach dance and will definately use a lot of these moves.And, you will work up a sweat, if you want more just do jumping jacks or run when they march.  Enjoy
I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS GREAT!NOTHING LIKE THE GOSPEL TO ME!!DON'T COMPARE!BILLOAH IS SEXY BABY!HE PLAYED ZULU!! (PRETTY EYES)THE MOVIE WAS VERY FUNNY ALSO AND TAUGHT A LESSON IN LOVE!!!5 STAR MOVIE!!****
Sorry, after reading some negative reviews I just had to speak up.  This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I still to this day watch it over and over again.  Well directed, some of the best acting I have seen, and my god the cast in this movie, the list of stars is endless.  The courtroom scenes were so intense, I envey anyone who has not seen this yet.  The story was perfect and so many surprises and turns.  Really well done.  This movie is worth every penny, I just wish I would of got to see it in the movies.  It is the most powerful movie I have ever seen, how can anyone say this movie was not good, I guess they just can't handle the truth..
THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is Wes Anderson's third major motion picture.  The movie revolves around a rich, but extremely eccentric man name Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman).  Royal and his wife Etheline (Angelica Huston) had three children:  Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke Wilson).  In the 1970s the Tenenbaums were one of America's premier families:  Margot was a famous playwright, Richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive U.S. Nationals, and Chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen.  That was almost thirty years ago and the Tenenbaums have largely been forgotten.  Betrayal, failure, and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died.  What's worse is that Royal's children and wife blame him for all their failures.  Royal senses that his time is Earth is waning and he wishes to set things right.  With the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend, Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), Royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family's eyes.I'm a pretty big fan of Wes Anderson and have seen all four of his films.  THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is Anderson's most critically acclaimed and his most popular picture.  However, it is my least favorite of his movies.  Like all Anderson films the movie is filled with quirky characters and witty dialogue.  The film is about the redemption of a man in the eyes of his family, a theme that I enjoy.  Yet, the film just didn't resonate with me as much as Anderson's other pictures.  I really don't know why that is.  That's not to say THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is a bad movie because it's not.  In addition to everything else mention it also has some good acting, brilliant set designs, etc.  I just prefer a movie about thieve brothers or a film about a precocious teenage genius or comic-drama about a sea-voyaging documentarian instead
The folks at PBS deserve the gratitude of photography teachers and students everywhere. Taking on subject matter as impossibly broad as photography in 20th Century America? This documentary covers-- sometimes comprehensively, sometimes briefly-- virtually every important topic germane to the field of study, from Pictorialism to Straight Photography, from fashion to the scientific. Along the way, we are introduced (or reintroduced) to what has been the medium's most important uses: journalism and documentary. "A Century of Images" is as instructive for the novice as it may be reaffirming to those already familiar with much of the material. Underlying a wealth of historical examples and anecdotes are the two twin themes that raise this effort above the mundane: concern over the ethical issues photographs present, and the effects of mechanically produced images in the post-industrial age on the psyche of our nation. These themes manifest themselves in ways that are often revelatory and moving. One memorable example: the way Edward Curtis's images of Native Americans are placed into context by a woman who appreciates them, yet yearns for more images that show her people the way they "really were." Sections on war photography cover WWI, WWII, Vietnam and the Gulf War with compassion, and work as excellent visual aids to discussions on todays situation in Iraq. Another bonus: the section on the transition to a digital age has not yet outlived its usefulness.Until I was able to buy this fabulous history on DVD, my biggest complaint was that while using the VHS version, I had all kinds of problems locating the various scenes I wanted to pull out to show my photography and visual communication courses at the university where I teach. Now that I can happily locate scenes at will using the DVD menu, I can direct my ire at its few but significant omissions and shortcomings. More on Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus please . . . . they were pretty damned influential.
One of the movies I like to watch over and over.  Jessica Tandy played a great character in this movie.  My order came real quick
The funny thing about this movie is that I read negative reviews here, and rather agree with what they assert: that the plots and some of the characters are not very "evolved" due to time. If you disect the movie, yes this is *true.*NONETHELESS, I love this movie! I love watching the what the actors DO with this material, and how they manage, with so little time, to invest the viewer in their story. Emma Thompson gives a perfect performance, I think, highlighting how complicated long marriages can become, and the pitfalls of being "too functional." Bill Nighy is hilarious, acting as the needed jolts in between serious moments...quite refreshing.   Most of all, it is genuinely funny.  Life can feel (or at least my life can feel) disjointed, and I love a movie where a larger pattern emerges from seemingly chaotic events and connections. 
 The military courtroom drama,"A Few Good Men" is one of those films, that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it's own. But even with countless viewings it retains it's emotional power and speaks to us about issues, that have become more important than ever. In the film we meet Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) a young successful, military lawyer, who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases, that supposably he's "never even seen the inside of a courtroom". He is assigned the cases of PFC Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Cpl. Harold Dawson (Wolgang Bodison). They are accused of murder and a host of other charges, when at the Guantanamo Bay military base they performed a "Code Red" (an illegal form of discipline within a military unit) on Pvt. William Sandiago, which unintentionally resulted in his death. While the two accused Marines admit they did the "Code Red", both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors, which includes Base Commander, Col. Nathan Jessup (a brillaint Jack Nicholson) a powerful, highly decorated officer, who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command. With both time running out and a lack of legal evidence, Kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case, even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy. Through a brilliant script (based on the play by Aaron Sorkin), Rob Reiner's steady direction and the cast's dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as "code, honor & discipline". Should a soldier always follow orders no matter what? Whats' more important our ethics & principles (on which this country was founded) or our need for security? Is Col. Jessup right? Can we not "handle the truth"? It's hard to believe, that this film was made way back in 1992. In this post 9/11, post Abu Grebbe world, where our country is on a war footing the questions, that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever. The film is filled with great performances. While I am not normally a huge Tom Cruise fan, I have to admit, that Cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer. The same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland. But what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant, dynamic performance, that comes from Jack  Nicholson. When Cruise puts Nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on, you just watch in awe as Nicholson just continually builds the character's palpable anger, until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous "You Can't Handle the Truth" speech. Even though the speech and Nicholson's performance has been endlessly quoated & parodied, when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance. If you are interested in seeing a well made, movie courtroom drama, that is both thought provoking and entertaining then I highly recommend "A Few Good Men"
I was sooooooooo excited to see that this movie had been released, and I was not disappointed.  The dancing was magnificent, and it was amazing to see Patrick & Lisa together.I have to saythought for many....it was disheartening to see you perform with your wife, Patrick, because so many of us have fantasized of that same possibility!I would recommend it to ALL who love dance!  It is a beautiful tribute to what a person CAN do!
If you liked "Raise the Red Lantern" or "The Last Emperor",this is a perfect movie.Gong Li,who played a concubine fighting with others for her husband's affection now plays a woman who realizes another man loves her husband."Farewell My Concubine" uses Chinese opera as a way of telling the story.I used to listen to a lot of Chinese opera--which is an acquired taste.This movie uses the story of a king&his beloved concubine's self-sacrifice to frame the love story between two men.When one of the men falls in love with and marries a woman,the stage is set for a tragic love triangle.The final scenes are chilling,powerful.This is a spectacle not to be missed
There aren't enough movies like this these days. Family oriented(centered actually), adventure with edutainmental attributes.Great cast, great score, great(albeit goofy) story.People give this film too much credit for being implausible, which is exactly what makes it so much fun to imagine the ramifications if it were true. If you're looking for adventure and fun, thrilling characters in a family film, this is it
Amazon.com made sure I received my items in time.  Above receiving the movie in excellent condition, the movie is entertaining and reminds you what real acting is.
Really does not get the film noir credit it deserves (probably from its title with the uninformed film watcher expecting this to be a feature starring Dinah Shore or other 1940's musical starlet.) Some very satisfying twists of the old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings scale.  Gene Tierney is wonderfully mercurial - sometimes hot-hot-hot and other times just plain icy cold. This was her only Oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked here.  See Gene in this and in "Laura" and you will see two of the best 1944 leading actress film perfomances
Fraser's film is truly a winner in production quality.   His attention to detail by bringing in his theatrical savvy is a nonpareil.  Despite all the cliches that can be stated about this film; eye-candy performers, lighting, fantastic musical score, and riske scenes, this film has visually appealing sequences.  If anyone is interested in film and theatrical production, I would highly recommend the director's commentary-you really get an insight to an artist in process.  From the commentary, it seems that Fraser will never be finished with this film: a mentale that I admire in an artist.  Art is a process and is never perfect.  This is another one of those great modern plays that works very well for the film.   Getting to the roots of the human psyche is something films should continue into the future.  This film does explore the 3 dimensionality of people.   I did have a problem with the didacticism of the script however.   Though most writers try to leave it up to the audience to decide, I feel that the script gave little regard for wives who are victims of their husbands having gay affairs.  I had to agree with another reviewer who titled his review as "Selfish gay guy ruins a marriage". (On the other hand, Cherilee Taylor did a great job in combating this fault with the script; she wasn't quite the victim her character ultimately could have become.)  By the end of the film, I was wondering how Violet was making it as a once again as single woman.  From an audience's standpoint, we didn't really see that.  David and Kryla make up, Matt goes to illustration school, but what happens to Violet?   Overall, I would highly recommend this film.  With such a great interpretation on the screen, it would be nice to see this staged once again in the lort theatres.

Since "ER" debuted on NBC in 1994, it's taken the nation by storm.  It's wonderfully produced by author Michael Chricton,  a former surgeon before his writing career.  For numerous years, it was the #1 drama series on television.  The show starts with the cast of Anthony Edwards (Mark Greene), George Clooney (Doug Ross), Sherry Stringfield (Susan Lewis), Noah Wyle (John Carter), Julianna Margulies (Carol Hathaway), and Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton).  It has since won and been nominated for several awards including Emmys.  Its hospital action combined with personal drama always draws audiences deeply into every scene for every episode.  Its emergency scenes grown in intensity and drama through the episodes.Season one introduces the everyday life in the ER in Chicago.  Throughout, it explores many critical issues including Hathaway's self-destruction that results in a suicide attempt, Carter struggling as a medical student, Ross living his sex obsessed life, and others.  Regular show viewers who haven't seen season one will see part of Lewis's reason for leaving Chicago in 1996, Greene in his first marriage and before Ella's birth (mother is Corday, who began in 1997), Deb Chin's (played by Ming Na) brief time in that ER as a medical student before returning as an official doctor in 2000, and many others.  Such combination shows partially how the show's theme evolved to today.  Episode by episode, the plot's quality stays on top.  The overall scenery, through the physical environment to the emotional drama, never fails to compile the unforgettable viewing experience.Season two features the debuts of Gloria Reuben (Jeanie Boulet) and Laura Innes (Kerry Weaver, not an official cast member until season 3).  This season explores Ross's most heroic act as a doctor, Carter becoming a doctor, Lewis being forced to care for her neice, and many more.  Today's viewers who haven't seen season two will witness Boulet before testing positive for HIV, Weaver before realizing her lesbianism, Hathaway before her today's happy life (though now in Seattle), and others.  This plot evolves very well in quality from the previous season.  It continues its run of staying on top in critical care and drama.Both seasons feature wonderful acting from the entire cast.  All add their own sense of individual theme into every scene.  Through personal struggles, drama, and continually saving lives, everyone gives the show its unique viewing flavor.Such show quality makes "ER - The Complete First Two Seasons" worthy for all fans.  This is sure to please its audiences.  New viewers should watch these two seasons first.  Otherwise, the plot will be confusing.  Fans should watch for season 3 to be released on video in the near future
I remember watching this in high school. I thought it was great fun then and my kids think it still is now. Okay, we're not talking Academy award material here (Emmy?).Ralph, Bill, & Pam are back for the third and final season of this far too short series about a man who is given a suit by aliens that gives him super powers. He is teamed with an FBI agent to help the world survive itself. In the first few minutes Ralph looses the instruction book and must noodle out how to operate the suit. He runs into a few walls, literally. The first season was a little rough. The second season fleshed out the concept. This third season started to stretch its legs but the show was cancelled.I have looked for years for novels based on the show, to no avail. I even contacted Cannell to ask if I could write them. As Disney is half-heartedly working on a feature film based on the show Cannell wouldn't cut loose with permission. Alas, It would've been fun.Anyway, if you have the other two seasons you'll love this one. The only complaint/change I would make is having to play the theme song before each episode. I would've made it so you could hit the "forward to next" button and go right to the action. Also, the jacket plays a bit of the theme song. I wish they'd made it possible to change the batteries.Mike Hudspeth in St.Louis, Missour
Audrey, without Givenchy, and only a portion of her face visible, few lines and much conflict gives one of the great performances.  The depth of the movie, the richness, amount to a great piece of art.  Certainly, the movie is not "fun," but it attests to a time when a movie about the struggle with faith could be a blockbuster
I really like this DVD - you can get some really good exercise in only 10 minutes.  Lara does not waste time on lengthy explanations between exercises, and she moves quickly from one exercise to another.  I like the variety of exercises - there are not too many rep's on any one exercise, which keeps the workout from being monotonous.  This is the first "programmable" exercise DVD I've used, and I like being able to pick and choose which exercise segments to do and in which order - this makes it easier for me to get motivated to start (and once I start, I'm fine)
This DVD contains all of the original Ben Stiller Show episodes, plus an extra un-aired episode. The show was not only far ahead of its time, but also timeless as is evidenced by Stiller's subsequent successful movie roles that drew from many of the characters from the TV series. For anyone who was a fan of the TV series or Stiller's movies, this DVD is a must
It is nice to see Sarah Michelle Geller in a not-so-nice, anti-heroine role here. I'm so used to seeing her as "Buffy"
Tom Cruise gives an excellent performance as IMF agent Ethan Hunt,who is framed for murder after the death of his IMF team.Together with the help of two other IMF agents,Hunt sets out to find the real murderer.Cornered most of the movie and set to his limits,Hunt and team are hard put to catch the assailants.It all leads to a final showdown on a speeding bullet train with an unlikely foe.Hard core action and awesome intellegence meet in this exhillirating action drama by filmmaker Brian DePalma
I guess I understand why this movie was so savagely criticized during it's year of release, 1986.  Prince was still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of "Purple Rain," both the film and the soundtrack.  And critics love to knock someone off a pedestal, which is what they did to Prince in those days.  Many claimed that the movie was nothing more than an ego trip.  They couldn't believe Prince had the nerve to fire the director and then assume that role himself.  It was all way too harsh criticism for a movie that isn't trying to be anything more than a fun romantic comedy. Of course, poor critical response alone doesn't usually keep the public from making a movie popular.  Yet "Under the Cherry Moon" was a bomb at he box office.  Probably the main reason for this is that the movie, although shot in color, was released in black-and-white.  For some unfathomable reason, the general movie-going public is more often than not horrified at the prospect of seeing a black-and-white movie.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not claiming that had the movie been released in color that people would have flocked to it in droves.  I'm only saying that it would have attracted more of an audience if it had been in color.  I will acknowledge that this movie's target audience is Prince fans.  Since I am one myself, and have been most of my life, I'm not the most entirely objective viewer.But I make no apologies for my love of this movie.  It's not a "guilty pleasure" for me, because I proudly hold this as one of my favorites.  I had only seen it a couple times before the DVD release - and unfotunately I missed it in theaters (I couldn't get anyone to take me, I was only 12 and none of my friends were into P and certainly not my parents - though my dad went with me a few years later to see "Grafitti Bridge" on opening night, but that's for another review).  But since it's DVD release in 2004, this has become one of my most-watched discs in my collection.The soundtrack is KILLER, the tunes make up one of the best Prince albums ever.  There's even some great stuff heard in the movie that didn't make the album (some of which was issued on 12" vinyl).  Plus, I think the movie looks great - the cinematographer was Michael Ballhaus, who has multiple Academy Award nominations to his credit (and was the DP on numerous Martin Scorsese classics).  I wonder how the movie would feel in color, but I do think black-and-white was the right way to go.  Even though the movie is set in then-contemporary times, it has the feel of something from the '30s.  There are so many classic moments in this movie, I won't try to list them all.  But here are a few... Christopher Tracy (Prince) giving his "Bela Lugosi eyes"...Tricky (Jerome Benton) tossing rose petals into the tub while Christopher takes a bath...Christopher freaking out when he sees bats at the eatery...the "Wreka Stow" scene...the car race between Christopher and Mary Sharon (Kristen Scott Thomas).As for the acting, I've heard a lot of people saying that Prince's performance was no good.  I don't see much truth in that claim.  After being so serious in "Purple Rain," it was a nice contrast to see him so loose and funny in this.  Jerome Benton proved he could do just fine even without Morris Day at his side (as in "Purple Rain") - I'm surprised Jerome hasn't done much additional acting outside of Prince movies.  And obviously Kristen Scott Thomas moved on from this, her first major role, to become an Oscar-nominated, highly repected leading lady.  How is the DVD presentation?  Pretty good, for such a largely overlooked movie.  The widescreen transfer and 2.0 stereo mix aren't anything phenomenal, but get the job done nonetheless; the movie looks and sounds fine.  As for features, anyone expecting a full-blown Special Edition like the 2-disc "Purple Rain" will be disappointed.  But at least it's not a completely bare-bones release - four music videos are included, though unfortunately not presented in optimal audio/visual quality (though they are passable, I would've preferred 5.1 mixes).  The highlight is the live performance of "anotherlover" which was taken from a never-released (at least not domestically, not sure if it saw the light of day anywhere outside the U.S.) concert video documenting the Parade tour.  MTV held an interesting (i.e.- very weird) contest to determine where "Under the Cherry Moon" would have it's world premiere.  The ten-thousandth caller to an MTV hotline would accompany Prince to the premiere, which would be held in their hometown.  MTV ran a special that covered the premiere party - and unlike the premiere of "Purple Rain" unfortunately this program is not to be found on "Under the Cherry Moon"'s DVD release.  Lisa Barber was the contest winner, and the movie did indeed premiere in her hometown of Sheridan, Wyoming - a very unusual place for a big movie to premiere.  When asked what he thought of the town of Sheridan, Prince summed it up with a single word: "Purple."
Bob Crane shot to television stardom in the 1960s as the star of the television series Hogan's Heroes. However, while he was enjoying the life of a TV star, he was simultaneously delving into dark territory in his personal life - sexual promiscuity and deviance. Auto Focus tells the story of Bob Crane as a tragic cautionary tale of the dangers of excess.When the film opens, Bob (Greg Kinnear, in a fantastic performance) is about to hit the big time, and is a loving family man who doesn't drink or smoke. He attends mass on Sundays. One day on the set of Hogan's Heroes, though, his life begins to take a bit of a turn when he meets John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe), a techno-guy with all the latest gadgets, including video equipment, which fascinates Crane."Carp" opens the door for Bob to unleash his inner desires, which both excite and frighten him. It begins innocently enough, sitting in on the drums at a strip club, but eventually Bob loses all self-control and ends up making pornographic videos of his exploits and frequently "swinging." All the while Bob refuses to admit that there's anything wrong with him; if you ask him, he'll tell you he's just a normal guy.After Hogan's Heroes came to an end, Crane took a job with a dinner theatre show, which allowed Crane and Carp to take their liaisons on a traveling show. As Crane's indiscretions get worse, his personal life deteriorates, as he divorces two wives (played by Rita Wilson and Mario Bello).Auto Focus has been expertly directed by Paul Schrader, who begins the film with bright, glossy colors, then as Crane goes deeper and deeper into his obsessions, the colors fade and the camera becomes unstable, just as Crane does. Kinnear gives the performance of his life, showing us an uptight man who is afraid of his sexual demons turning into an uptight man who lets them take over his life.
It embarrases me that I, a music man, have let this many years go by without reviewing this splendid movie. My wife rented it from a Hasting's video store back when DVDs were not widely distributed. I was in awe of the movie as it ended because I had no clue what to expect, and I wasn't expecting much anyway.Richard Dreyfuss plays the role of Glenn Holland, a recent college graduate who takes the job of a music teacher to provide an income (he calls it a 'fall back position') while he writes what he hopes will be a musical masterpiece that will make him rich and famous. His first semester is a trying and learning experience as students see him as that school teacher everybody hated and whose class everyone dreaded.But he finds his way into the students' hearts. The movie begins in the early 1960s, and rock 'n' roll has etched a permanent mark on the music landscape. Most of the students, of course, love the new music. Realizing he has an 'in' with the students, he makes an accurate comparison by playing Bach's "Minuet in G" (for Anna Magdalena) and asking the students what song it is. They reply it is the "Lovers Concerto" by the Toys ("What color is the rain that falls softly on my window.."). He notes they are wrong and that it is actually the SAME song (although he doesn't note that Bach's is in 3/4 and the Toys in 4/4) and is an example of an ancient music scale called the Dorian scale. He now has them right where he wants them.Along the way, he continues to work on his masterpiece. But life, a new baby who turns out to be deaf, and the need for new things put his life on hold. As he notes by quoting John Lennon, "Life is what happens while you're making other plans" (or some facsimile thereof). Years continue to go by and events occur that happen in the life of virtually ever music teacher.He has that one student who has a lot of heart but not a lot of ability - yet needs to get an hour of credit so he can remain eligible to play football. He has another student who wants to play the clarinet but is nervous. Yet he always comes back to the simple rock 'n' roll to make his point about 'real' music.But reality plays hide and seek sometimes. He has it out with his wife about their deaf son - and his frustrations come to a boiling point on the night John Lennon is killed. Over time, they become friends - and one of the sweet sights of the movie is the son feeling the vibrations from the speaker as he 'hears' the music.But another reality awaits - education budget cuts, and here Dreyfuss delivers the line with outstanding effect: "The day they cut the football budget in this state...well, that will certainly be the end of western civilization as we know it." It is in the presence of his now good friend, Jay Thomas (the football coach), that he talks about how he never wanted to teach but now that is all he wants to do.The music track in this movie is awesome. There's just one thing I'm still trying to figure out: how did the students manage to mass distribute his music and practice it without him knowing it?
"Animal House" raised the bar, and set a standard for all comedies that followed. Many have tried to duplicate the originality of this movie, and all have failed to come close.A classic for the ages
"Dave" is a lot of fun, as a look-alike gets to pretend to be president, gradually gets a big head and tries to use the power, and makes high-stakes enemies. I am a big fan of Sigourney Weaver, and she is very good here. Kevin Kline does well, as well. The forces of good beat back the dark side of politics for awhile, and an ordinary guy finds extraordinary adventure and true love. Definitely worth a rental, if romantic and comic politics with a bit of danger is your bag
I was fourteen years old when I attended the New York Premier of this movie at the Rivoli Theater. I have the original Premier Book from the theater; which is NOT for sale. I immediately fell in love with the beautiful Ingrid Bergman. So did millions of other young men. This movie did not win the award of the year; it was overshadowed by "Casablanca"; which in my estimation, was of inferior quality, compared to For Whom the Bell Tolls.  Bob Richard
I have been following the Laughing Man fansubs, so I've covered all this material before. I'm acquiring the DVDs as they come out to have legit copies.The desc says 2 collectibles toys, it's actually 3. There is Batou on the plate like Motoko from Vol 3. In fact, the base plates fit together, which makes me belive that vol 5 will have another piece that will fit together to complete a composite set. The other two toys are the Chinese assassin with the gun-arm and the old robot unit from the organ-farming business (with the fake southern accent). These are easier to put together, I had problems with the Tachikoma from the last set, it broke when I tried to put the legs on. Haven't gotten around to the super-glue session yet.The product itself: Stand Alone Complex - 2nd Gig continues some of the best animation and smartest television ever produced. Buy it, share it with those persons worthy/capable of appreciating it
This re-telling of the so-called "zoot suit riots" that rocked the Los Angeles homefront during World War II gets the facts right, but tells them rather poorly.  Part of it is the super-stagey presentation, which basically is a filming of the play this was based on (right down to the shaking props and backdrops) and which takes little advantage of the possibilities of the film medium. Plus, Edward James Olmos is absolutely insufferable as the uber-symbolic Voice of The Barrio, although Daniel Valdez and Tyne Daly (!) are okay in their respective roles as a young man railroaded by the white establishment for a crime he did not commit, and as the commie agitator who comes to his defense.  Anyone interested in the time period and in Chicano politics may benefit from watching this -- I rented it while doing some reseach on the "pachucho" R&B music scene -- but in dramatic and filmic terms, this is not a first-rate production.  It's hammy and ham-fisted.  Latter-day star spotting:  El Teatro Campesion veteran Robert Beltran (of future "Star Trek Voyager" notoriety) has a bit role as a modern-day audience member..
Not very familiar with Noam Chomsky's work but I have listened to many people say that he has very strong arguments. This film is proof of those arguments. Noam Chomsky has facts, refers to original sources, provides context and analysis and leaves  you feeling that you have heard a very solid and well-research argument. This film is a collection of such arguments on issues and events affecting many of us in the world. America's invasion of Iraq, the war on terror and what is behind it other than 9-11, and other topics are rich and insightful. This film provides a nice balance on Chomsky by giving us some insight into HIM which is interesting. I find him more fascinating now than I did as a skeptic who was challenged to actually read his material. This film gives those new to Noam Chomsky's books an excellent overview of the issues and events that he has written about in the last five years or so. After watching this film I went out and read 9-11 and his latest book. While good, the film gives us the same information but in a more direct and candid manner.
A true love-it-or-hate-it movie: my reaction fits closer with the first group.  This gritty look at the dark side of the drug culture plays like an open wound. The parallel stories chronicle a widow who descends into an addiction to diet pills, while her son tries to make a living dealing, although he, his partner, and his girlfriend smoke and snort a lot of the profits.  The director's jarring style fits the subject matter well, and Ellen Burstyn's performance as the diet pill addict is nothing short of amazing.  Julia Roberts beat her for Best Actress in 2000 with Erin Brockovich, which was a fine role and performance, but Burstyn was in another world.  Those who hate the film will complain about the style and whether the events at the end make any sense.  I can understand the second objection, hence four stars rather than five.Note: I got this movie from Netflix--I'm not sure if I was watching the director's cut or not
I like this season because it has moved out of the developing storyline and gone into conflicting with each other with two of the best twist in a show ever!
Spurlock has brought new meaning to reality shows.  Constructive, insightful, inspirational, educational, and entertaining, these very interesting journeys had me hooked for 6 hours straight.  Just think what you could do with your own life in 30 days! Should be emmy nominated; it's that good.  Brilliant
Haven't we all been there? Wishing we could be better than someone else? Wishing that we had our turn in the spotlight? This is exactly how the movie "Cheaters" affected me. I found it truly amazing that this movie was made on a true story like this. The plot is really incredible and actually makes you ponder the question "What would I do in this situation?" Jeff Daniels and Jena Malone give such incredible performances in this movie. I believe that they are very convincing. If you are in the mood to be emotionally touched by a movie, "Cheaters" is the true direction for you to head in
By winning their third title in four years the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and dreams of generations of New Englanders wins its first World Series in 86 years.It's true, the Patriots somehow pieced together a team that, despite a string of injuries that seemed to defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive campaign as Super Bowl champions with a 17-2 record (which just as easily could have/should have been 18-1)...but the 2004 Boston Red Sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the American Sports atmosphere and somehow the 2004 Patriots season just doesn't seem to measure up to the previous title years of 2001 and 2003.  Part of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own personalities (2001 having 9/11, the coming-of-age of Tom Brady, the Snow Bowl, and the unbelievable finish of what was probably the most exciting Super Bowl ever.  2003 had the release of Lawyer Milloy, the early stumbles to Buffalo and Washington, the birth of the winning streak, winter weather in Foxboro, and yet another thrilling Super Bowl finish); 2004 just seemed like an anticlimax by comparison, like you were watching a scripted performance that was always going to end with the "W" on the Patriots' side of the field.This is not to say that there were not intriguing challenges that made for good storytelling...the injuries (leading to the incredible "throwback" two-way play of veteran Wide Receiver/rookie Cornerback Troy Brown), the continued winning streak, the rebirth of offseason acquisition Corey Dillon, the continuing mastery of the Indianapolis Colts, and the return to Pittsburgh (where the record 21-game winning streak came to an emphatic end on Halloween (just days after the Red Sox won the World Series, karmically enough), where University of Michigan graduate Tom Brady resurrected himself from a triple-digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the best regarded defense in the NFL to send the Patriots back to the Super Bowl, this time in the unfairly maligned city of Jacksonville, FL.No nail-biting endings this time, though...despite the best efforts of Terrell Owens to come back from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of anyone else (with the possible exception of Curt Schilling, of course), the Eagles All-Pro was clearly the second-best receiver on the field as Deion Branch won the Super Bowl MVP for a record day (Safetyman and Render Of Mayhem Extraordinaire Rodney Harrison would have been my pick, actually) and the Patriots, though trailing early, never really seemed in doubt of winning a game they led by 10 points late before prevailing by the final score of 24-21 which in truth flattered the Eagles more than they deserved.Far be it that a season ending with a record of 17-2 and another Super Bowl ring should be considered hum-drum, but there was something missing from the 2004 campaign that, impressive as it was, just doesn't translate to the memorable re-telling that the Pats' previous title years do.  This is a great DVD for Pats fans, indispensible even, but for the casual fan who appreciates the drama that a good NFL season can bring, I would recommend either of the previous Patriots highlights DVD's over this one
This review refers to "Excalibur"(DVD-Region 2)   In days of old, with knights so bold, and fair maidens glittering all in gold, lays the legend of King Arthur, Camelot, and the powerful, mystical sword known as "Excalibur". John Boorman's beautiful artistic film (adopted from Sir Arthur Mallory's "Le Morte D'Arthur"),will captivate you and take you away to another time and place. From the birth of Arthur, Merlin taking him away for 20 years, Arthur drawing "Excalibur" from the stone, the emergence of Camelot,the magical powers of Merlin and the evil Morgana, to Arthur's demise and being taken off to Avalon, the beauty of this film and this story will have you under a spell.   The European cast and the exquisite location shoots in the country side of Ireland add a sense of authenticity to the flavor of this film. King Arthur, The Knights of the Round Table,Sir Lancelot, Guinevere, Merlin, Morgana, Sir Gawain, Percival, Uther, they're all very much part of the story, and the cast is tremendous. Nigel Terry is the good and noble King Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere, who loved their King but also each other are played by Nicholas Clay and Cherie Lunghi. You'll see stellar performances by a young Gabriel Bryne(in his first feature film), Patrick Stewart, and Liam Neeson. Helen Mirren is excellent as the evil Morgana, and the always wonderful Nicol Williamson is the magical mystical Merlin   This edition is for viewers with DVD players compatible with Region 2(Japan, Europe, South Africa, and the Middle East, including Egypt ).Some players are multi-regional, so check your manual.   Parents...although a wonderful tale of knights and fair ladies, this is NOT one for younger viewers. The battle scenes are violent and a bit graphic and there are also some sexual situations. "First Knight" with Richard Gere and Sean Connery, although not quite as true to the legend, is rated PG-13, is quite an entertaining film, and may be more suitable for family viewing(there is some violence).   A beautiful story and film. Enjoy....Lauri
Release the bats is definatly one of my favorite dvds i own. It will show you a side of pete wentz and others you may or may not want to see... i thought it was very interesting to see and its kind of cool to see another side others may not have. You also get to find out who Dirty is or whatever. Pete says things about him in a couple of places (online) and all i could think is "who is that?" so thats also very exciting. I would say as long as you have a good sense of humor your pretty much safe buying this.remember: its the stuff deemed 'unfit' for "my heart with always be the b-side to my tongue
In an attempt to meet more girls, I took French many, many years ago when I was still in junior high school (middle school to you young 'uns). In class, my French teacher treated us to a film screening of Jean Cocteau's LA BELLE ET LA BETE (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST). Truthfully, back then, I didn't think much of it other than being something too "arty." But, over the past two decades, I've seen this film a number of times and now have a decidedly higher opinion of it. LA BELLE ET LA BETE is a seriously important movie and a groundbreaking entry into the world of cinema. It's certainly Cocteau's masterpiece. Without a doubt, it provided the direct inspiration for Disney's Oscar-nominated version, as well as greatly influencing CBS's 1987 BEAUTY AND THE BEAST television series.Jean Cocteau took Madame Leprince de Beaumont's classic story, adapted it, and put his own stamp on it. Cocteau's artistic vision is dazzling to behold. The viewer is treated to a delectable visual feast replete with disturbingly aware statues, ghostly arms jutting out of walls to clutch  candles, vocal household objects, jewelry which turns to rubbish, etc. But nicely juxtaposed with the imaginative, surrealistic trappings are the more mundane sequences revolving around Belle's family, which serve to somewhat ground the fairy tale to a more reality-based semblance.      This atmospheric film was given an enormous lift by the very wonderful performances of the two leads, Josette Day and Jean Marais. Josette Day, as Belle, her most luminous role, personified beauty, grace, and class. Jean Marais, on the other hand, made women and young girls swoon in his dual roles as the handsome scoundrel Avenant and the tortured but gentle-hearted Beast. In fact, Marais portrayed the fearsome Beast in such a sympathetic and romantic light that, in the end, when the hirsute and awful monster was transformed into the handsome prince, Cocteau and Marais actually received many letters of complaint. The women much preferred their kindly Beast. ************************************************************The Criterion Collection's high-definition, crystal clear digital transfer is awesome to experience, lending a lushness and clarity that was lacking in the older, grainier copies. This film is also well-stocked with special features: - 2 audio commentaries - a Philip Glass opera soundtrack option - "Screening at the Majestic" -  a 1995 documentary featuring interviews with the cast and crew - Interview with the film's Director of Photography Henri Alekan - "Secret Professionels: Tete a Tete" (Professional Secrets: Face to Face) -  the title of a French television show, of which particular 1965 episode showcases makeup artist Hagop Arakelian, who worked on LA BELLE ET LA BETE  - the original trailer - the restoration trailer - Film Restoration segment - Stills Gallery- a booklet which includes Jean Cocteau's notes on the film and a reprinted translation of Madame Leprince de Beaumont's original fable.   
I have not gotten into watching the DVD as of yet because I am still watching the reruns on tv, but I know I have no qualms with the dvd. I have bought all the series thus far. It is a collection to have in your library if you are indeed a fan
My kids really did learn a lot from this movie, I would recommend it when your child is trying to learn to go on the potty
Very entertaining movie. I enjoyed everything about this movie--- the acting, the humor, the singing and storyline!Also being from San Diego originally, it was nice to see famous hotel and landmark, The Hotel Del Coronado, being used in this movie as the hotel in which the all girls band performed and stayed! No the hotel wasn't The Seminole Ritz in Florida!
Jean Renoir's masterpiece, 'the grand illusion', is truly a film about humanity - it is a universal theme, something we can all understand and relate to. The triumph of the human spirit in the most troubled times, is kind of an ironic theme considering Hitler's imminent rise to power and the ensuing war that would alter the course of history. Nevertheless, Jean Renoir's poetic homage to brotherhood is one of his most beloved films. It is not hard to like this movie the acting and direction are superb - Jean Gabin is one of the all time great actors..Jean Renoir's innovative approach would influence countless directors to come, including Orson Welles..Criterion did a marvelous job on this dvd - also worth getting is 'the rules of the game' jean renoir's greatest satire
Arturo Bandini (Colin Farrell) arrives from Colorado to Los Angeles. He is an aspiring writer who is getting down to his last nickel. He prays for inspiration to find another interesting story to write.  He meets a mexican waitress, Camilla (Salma Hayek) in a cafe and they just don't like each other, or do they?  Finally Auturo hits the mother lode. A letter he wrote has been changed into a short story for publishing along with a handsome paycheck.  It is just enough for him to buy a new suit outfit, a few suppers and pay the rent for a while.  Arturo is a very well mannered man, but keeps meeting these strange characters that get him all wrong.  Plays like film noir. The cinematography of 1934 Los Angeles is wonderful.  Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek in the moonlit ocean was breathtaking.  Colin Farrell perfected his American accent.  Very tastefully down skinny-dipping scenes and beautiful to watch.  AH! Give Colin a break. The water was cold.DVD includes Audio commentary, making of..., theatrical trailer
Every time this movie comes on my husband (who is English) and I watch it and laugh our heads off.If you have ever been in an English train station,drinking weak,watery cups of tea out of dirty,cracked cups.Smelling mildew and stale cigarettes while you freeze to death you would see the humor in anyone being romantically moved while sitting there.And not to be crule,but these are not exactly a couple of sex-pots.The thought of two stodgy old English people being driven wild by their passion for each other is,well------------------ hilarious! I give it 5 stars for being so darn funny.Oh--- and the music---- PLEASE!!!!!!!!!! But it is worth watching for a good laugh
"QUINCEANERA"Happy Birthday???Amos Lassen and Literary PrideOne of the great Mexican tardyons is celebrated by the new movie "Quinceanera", a traditional rite of passage. It takes place to signify that fifteen year old girls enter the world of womanhood. Magdalena (Emily Rios) is preparing for her party when the movie opens but she has a secret--she is pregnant. She was raised a devout Catholic girl and the fact that she is "with child" shames her conservative parents and they retaliate by ostracizing her. Distraught by her banishment from her family, Magdalena turns to her Uncle Tomas (Chalo Gonzales) who lives with her cousin, Carlos (Jesse Garcia) in a small apartment in Echo Park, Los Angeles. Carlos is open with her about his being gay and is being wooed by a new male couple which has moved into the neighborhood. What results is a ménage a trios between Carlos and the couple, one a television producer and the other a British citizen. Carlos bonds emotionally with one of the men and the situation becomes sticky and it jeopardizes Magdalena's new family unit.	In effect the movie takes a careful look at class differences and in doing so looks at the gay characters involved as flawed and it is obvious that Carlos is little more than a sexual pastime for the couple of upper-middle class men. What results is a highly emotional drama that we do not see often in American films but that foreign films seem to have a knack for dealing with.	Performances are excellent in the film and the directors Richard Glatzner and Wash Westmoreland give us a fresh new look on the gay cinema screen. Emily Rios is a charismatic young actress of whom we shall undoubtedly hear more and Chalo Gonzalez as Uncle Tomas gives a performance not easily forgotten. He is warm and laden with emotion that glows in his portrayal.	Everything about this movie is fine, the script, the actors, the photography and the open description of sexuality as well as the sincerity and the love with which it was made.	Awarded several prizes such as the dramatic audience and jury prizes at the 2006 Sundance Festival, "Quinceanera" is a marvelous film--especially because it wears its queerness so well, the gay it balances both gay and straight story lines and the way it deals with such important issues as sexuality, maturation, culture clashes and love.Simply put this is an amazing film and should not be missed.
5 CLASSIC FILMS BY ONE OF THE BEST AFRICAN AMERICAN DIRECTORS OF ALL TIME FOR $20.00! IF YOU THINK THIS ISN'T A GREAT DEAL THAN OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A PROBLEM! MO BETTA BLUES IS ONE OF THE MOST WELL PUT TOGETHER PIECES AND IF YOU ENJOY THE FILMS I SUGGEST LISTENING TO THE ACTUAL SOUNDTRACKS
This is an O.K movie. I give it a 3.5. It starts out with the origin of Mewtwo, as using DNA from the legendary Pokemon Mew's eyebrow fossil to create a clone, Mewtwo. Soon, Team Rocket leader Giovanni tries to control Mewtwo after he destroys the lab from which he was born in, but Mewtwo has other plans, thinking his purpose is not to serve humans. So he invites the most powerful Pokemon trainers to the New Island to see who can stand up to him. But things get outta control when Mewtwo steals all the Pokemon in black Pokeballs and creates artificial "Super-Clones" to prove that clones are the strongest in the universe. But he didn't count on Ash, a young Pokemon Trainer. Ash destroys the cloning machine, thus bringing Mew to the scene and saving the captured Pokemon. Who'll win? The superclones or the originals? Mew or Mewtwo? You've got to see it to beleive it

The economy, austerity and directness of the films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound, and precise filmmakers... Lang, a master of the German expressionist film, shot his first talkie, a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies... It was a shocking idea for its time, based on the real-life killer Peter Kurten, headlined as the Vampire of Düsseldorf...'M' is about a terrorized city, and a plump little man with wide eyes (often chewing candy) who is a pathological child-killer, unable to control his urge for killing... The film embodies several Lang themes: the duality between justice and revenge, mob hysteria, the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in, and, for probably the first time in the cinema, it adds a new dimension to suspense: pity... For the killer is clearly mentally sick... He cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease, and yet, we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal, rather than treated as a sick man... Early in the film, the killer is heard whistling the Grieg theme from 'In the Hall of the Mountain King'. This theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace... And when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window, the melody on the sound-track told us chillingly that the murderer is there, just out of sight...The Murderer is played by Peter Lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since 'Casablanca,' 'The Maltese Falcon,' and 'The Mask of Dimitrios.' When the photographs of his victims, all little girls, are shown to him, he jumps back and twitches with horror...With powerful visuals, Lang's motion picture is Lorre's first film... His performance as the corpulent, hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion... Lorre is the archetypal outsider-outside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes, outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal... He had only twelve lines of dialog...In the most famous of all about a pathological killer - Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' - Anthony Perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured Peter Lorre, but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy... 'Psycho' reeked with blood and horror, whereas the suspense of 'M' is subtle... A child's balloon without an owner, a rolling ball, are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed... The audience, trapped in its seats, torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer, watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight... 
The documentary showed some highlights of some excellent flying by various pilots.  However it did not show the abilities of different jets and pilots from different NATO countries.  The actual excercise is much longer and the documentary could have covered moreThe presentation both the picture and sound are top notch.  We found out that not every DVD system can read the IMAX presentation
I was more than impressed by this stupendous documentary.  Not only is it superior, photogrqphically speaking -- not only does it have beautiful & inspiring music -- it is factual and should open our eyes to what we have to lose in the name of oil!  We need to understand why environmentalists and educated elected officials care about protecting this pristine area. I was born, raised and educated in one of the most beautiful places in the U.S. in Boulder, CO -- at the foot of the flatirons -- BUT I truly feel this Alaska wilderness is "God's Country."  Buy this DVD -- view it -- invite everyone you care about to view it with you.  You wll begin to care and maYbe -- just maybe -- you will help to preserve it for your children & generations after you are gone
Although Tomorrow is Yesterday is an okay episode, it is not one to rave about.It is certainly not one of the original series' best. However, Return of the Archons is one of the best and one of my favourites.Kirk, Spock and McCoy investigate a planet where the inhabitants appear to be in a drug-induced state then rapidly change from walking peacefully and amiably along the streets into violent and looting maniacs that seem to lose all inhibitions. A mob attacks Kirk and crew and they are forced to defend themselves with their phasers. It seems the planet is run by a man named Landru, who advocates peace and tranquility to the extent that you get "absorbed".A kind of brainwash conditioning into thinking only of harmony and serenity.Later it is discovered that Landru is a computor projection;the edict of Landru who died 5,000 years ago has been continued by a computer I just read a review saying the solution to the Landru mystery won't surprise anyone, it sure surprised me. I didn't see that one coming
The casting here was excellent - Ben Stiller, Elle Macpherson, Sarah Jessica Parker were all great. In fact, I am convinced that Elle Macpherson can act because of the 3 movies I have now seen her in, she plays decidedly different people in each one. She is perfectly cast as Joe's dream woman. I found Eric Schaeffer's character the least appealing of the whole cast. Some of the jokes here are wildly funny.  The audience is never given a clue that the Jane Lindquist character is only getting involved with Joe to indulge the fantasy world he had created of her. I thought it was odd that she enjoyed his voyeurism and then seemed honestly interested in him sexually, but was not interested in a relationship with him. Earlier her character makes a statement that the world makes too much of the sexually charged days in the beginning of relationships, people move on after that part is over and that a lasting relationship is what she wants. That part did not make sense. This could have been improved by some better writing and better character development. The humor here is what makes this worth watching
I loved this movie...it was a little hard to follow because of the commercial break timings in it.  This did not make the movie any less great it just made the movie a little hard to follow because it kept repeating the intro. at the time that the commercial breaks should have been because of it being a TV show that was made into a movie
Those who hunt elves is worth the buy, you won't regret it.
I would reccomend this film to any Robert Johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at. It includes some great interviews with Johnny Shines, Robert jr Lockwood and others who knew Robert. Its worth it just to hear Lockwood play an unrecorded song of R.J.'s! The parts where Keb' Mo' re-enacts segments from R.J.'s life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman. My only criticism would be that there are few extra DVD features,however, that doesn't stop me watching this film again and again! A very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest Delta bluesmen
Don't discount this film because you are dismayed by Tom Cruise. This film is excellent and a must see. The symbolism in this film alone makes it worth a look. Attempt to ignore good old Tom and rekindle your love for him pre-insanity. Kubrick rarely gets enough accolades for this movie, as he should
I did not think, that the women Juliet Lewis, plays in this movie was mentally retatrted, i think she just has a disablity.\I hate that lable, if someone can walk and talk, and learn. I don't think so.
This is a wonderful show and very true to the band's recent live performances, albeit with a condensed songlist. I give it only 4 stars because I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Winwood and band live and the Sound Stage gig seems just a tad below that experience--which is admittedly an unfair comparison. Nothing to knock about this tidy show by a true virtuoso (actually a band of virtuosos). Consider it 4.5.
The Concert in Central Park is not only the best of Simon & Garfunkel's concerts, it is one of the best of anyone's concerts, in my estimation. The crowd was really in to it, and Simon and Garfunkle responded to them and delivered a top notch experience which captured the essence of the best of their music, and the era it was written in.I have owned the VCR tape for years, and enjoyed it many times, but the signal was beginning to fade, so I was very pleased to see it released on DV
Wow!!! I bought this set a couple of months ago and I've been watching each episode little by little, and enjoying each one of them a lot!!! It's interesting to watch Captain Scarlet again, thirty-something years after the last time I watched it back in the late 60s (when I was 7 or 8 years old)!I was (and still am) a huge fan of the "Thunderbirds" and became quite delighted when this new series from Gerry Anderson first appeared on TV back in the 60s! The quality of Captain Scarlet's special effects obviously got better since the Thunderbirds, and it really makes a huge difference (as far as realism is concerned) to have the marionettes more realistically proportioned! So much so, that there are times when you can almost forget that they are marionettes!The production still looks fabulous after all these years! The design of vehicles, machines, personal equipment, weapons, buildings, etc. is quite enjoyable, interesting and sometimes even surprising! The "Angels" (both airplanes and pilots) still manage to look amazingly sharp and contemporary!!! Perhaps only the automobiles give you a hint of the series real age, for they look quite dated indeed! However, now it seems a bit funny to see 1965 Chrysler and Ford lookalikes among the futuristic modernism of the series!Thirty-something years later, most of the episodes plots seem a bit shallow, almost stupid! But one has to remember that this series was meant for children! So, once you remember this you'll be ready to have a great time watching Captain Scarlet and his fellow Spectrum buddies fight the evil Mysterons (led by the sinister looking Captain Black), just as you did when you were still a child!Spectrum is green!!!...Enjoy it!!
With the flip of a coin , it's home I go. Ichi returns to the town he was raised as a child only to find that much has changed since he last left. A good film in the series I gave it five stars because I am bias and think that they all deserve five. This one was a strong introduction into Ichi's personal life along with the background of villians and lost ruffians with little or no way to reedeem their karma. Of course the cane sword is revealed yet again which leads to some good gore. I thought this was an all around good story with lots of underlying plays on greed and deception, and above all ,love ,shame and guilt from Ichi whom never seems to want to be bothered after it all goes down. Much is lost to our friend Ichi and he seems to just lose more.  
I really loved this dvd. There is some information for everybody, beginners as well as advanced. There is also a nice presence from Paul himself who does not hestitate to retrace the painful and private premices of this album. I was not necessarily a huge fan of his music and knew absolutely nothing of his personnal life and of his method in composing. This dvd, without being too personnal, made me discover the craftmanship of the composer and the depth of the man. I also enjoyed the discovery of the South-African music, their traditions and influence as described by some of the musician of that country. The many footages of the countryside were a pleasure, which worked perfectly with "Graceland" songs. The anecdotes are meaningful, witty, funny, deep, depending on the situation. None of them self-indulgent or egotistical. This DVD is a truly great journey with one of the most influential folk composer's. I would rank this DVD up there with "The Clash, West way to the world" and"U2, the making of the Joshua tree". 
Any Sam Kinison fan needs to own this DVD or video.  You get 2 of Sam's HBO specials plus many special stand up features and Sam's home movies.  The only reason I did not give this box set a 5 star rating is the fact that in the first special feature called: rare stand up(I love the special features on DVDs), Sam told many jokes that were already on the HBO special.  Other than that, Sam's comedy is unlike anything you will see today.  He will really be thought of as a comedy legend.  These DVD's will crack you up.  I would recomend buying the Sam Kinison CDs, Live From Hell, and Have you seen me lately?  The Cd's(just listen to them in your car or at home) will give you the complementary material you need(plus the HBO specials) to truely love Sam Kinison.  He is one of the best, and you will be satisfied with with any purchase.  Just buy 1 CD or DVD and you will be hooked
You might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut...but it's actually the opposite. I really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school.This is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like 16 but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the discovering and strength of two people...This movie is the real thing, i enjoyed it and i think many other people could too
This is one of the best G3s.  Maybe even the best.  I would have said that it was definitely the best if not for Mr.Malmsteen - the nicest thing one can say about the latter is that he knows his minor and major scales.But *I* don't want to be nice.  I want to be absolutely and unequivocally cruel when it comes to Malmsteen.He knows alternate picking, I'll give him that.  But then, so do I - and a million others.  He shouldn't be up there playing with Vai and Satriani solely because he can alternate pick faster than most (not all) people .  And yet he is.He shows over and over again, in this show, that the only thing he can do with the guitar is shred and shred and shred some more.  That's all. One of the interesting things about this DVD is that one cannot really measure the time between two consecutive shredding runs that Yngwie chooses to execute - it's less than about a second.  And this is an *average* figure.Enough about Yngwie, though he is the reason I'm writing this review - Satriani is absolutely amazing, as usual, with a brand new rendition of 'Midnight' and a nice solo at the end of 'Starry Night'.Vai, though, steals the show.  This coming from a guy who prefers Satriani.  But I can't help it - he is really that good.  And better.  'I Know You're Here'(which he plays on a triple neck Jem) contains at least seven new approaches to the same old things that you're taught at guitar school.  It is also the best song Steve Vai has ever written after 'Fire Garden Suite'. 'Juice' and 'I'm the Hell Outta Here' are also really really really good.Overall, a great DVD, though you should probably skip the parts with Yngwie in it
This is the 6th and last entry in the series Lone Wolf & Cub.  This one not only has a different director than Kenji, who directed 4 of the others, this is the entry most like a comic-book (the series is based on a famous comic book series).Not that that is bad.The whole series fluctuated between great period detail, serious themes, and not taking itself too seriously.  It was at once graphic and fantastic, realistic and wildly improbable,  factual and imaginary. serious & silly.  That's what made it so damn interesting.  Throughout the series the action has taken place in different locales and landscapes of Japan.  Tracing actual historical roads and cities.  Now we end the series in the mountains and the snow, the White Heaven in Hell of the title.This entry has a lot of stuff going on:  Lord Retsudo of the hated Yagyu Clan, Ogami's arch enemy, sends his last child, a daughter to do in Ogami with her "Falling Dagger" technique. When, predictably, she fails, he goes to an illegitimate son that was abandoned and raised by a mountain tribe.  The downhill ski battle may not be quite as intense and exciting as the one in Her Majesties Secret Service, but it ain't bad.  That Ogami's Baby Cart guns never seem to need reloading etc. are minor quibbles.  If Ogami doesn't shoot em he always seems able to bifurcate them, behead them, or run em through.  Red sprays all over the white snow.Anyway, they wind the series up with a bang.  One of the strangest, most unique, and unusual series ever produced anywhere.  Worth it if you don't mind the violence
If you haven't seen this you should. Great movie. Never get tired of seeing it. I think any age could watch this
This film i have to say is beautiful looking, from the characters to the landscape. Although lacking in numerous and long fight scenes, it does keep things interesting with matrix like effects. The only problem is the love between the two main characters . The movie never lets you feel the love between them , and the girl seems always distant about the love anyway  i mean it is called heart under blade right?  The main ninja character has the coolest power and he always seems troubled to use them it. This film is more of a drama sprinkled with ninja action and beautiful visuals! 
Tihs DVD truly has incredible camerawork, and fully illustrates the intelligence and beauty of dolphins, but some things people don't realize about dolphins kept in captivity need to be told.  PLEASE take the time to read this.Many dolphins you see in aquariums and swim-with programs and circuses around the world often come from brutal drive hunts, during which dolphins are rounded up into very tight nets concealing them, and are dragged ashore making it easier to violently wrestle them into slings.  These dolphins captured, while they may be smiling in appearance (which is the way their faces were genetically designed), are ripped away from their beloved podmates and torn from their environment.  How would you like to be a dolphin who once lived in a vast sea of blue and then suddenly be taken into a shallow pool of water, forced to live with the loud sounds of people screaming, the filtration system running, and very little space to swim?In the process of capturing dolphins for human entertainment, many die in the process.  Stress severely affects a dolphin's body, and many suffer irreperable damage to their hearts in the execution.  On top of that, dependent calves (baby dolphins) who have spent the entirety of their lives with their mothers, often get torn from them, leaving them helpless, even if they are released.  While you can clearly see in the film that many of the dolphins appear to be having fun, would it not be too much to consider the fact that they might miss their former companions?  Are they really happier stuck in a cement tank forced to perform tricks in order to be fed?  Keep this in mind the next time you visit an aquarium or swim-with program.  For dolphins captured in Japan, the industry has been given permits to slaughter a number of them needlessly in the process by the government.I believe this film spends too little time in the beginning addressing the human threat to dolphins.  Over 7,000,000 dolphins have died at the hands of humans since the late 1950s.  I think a few minutes at the beginning of the film doesn't nearly suit the need to inform the audience of the issue.  Tuna fisheries, whose products are falsely labeled as "dolphin-safe" (there are established 'KILL MINIMUMS' now for tuna companies) need to be exposed.  Intentional killings in Japan (especially), South America, and all over the world need to be publicized.  But I also understand that this is a family film, mainly, but I think it is also important to inform young viewers of the problems dolphins face with humans.  They are the ones who will need to make the difference in the future.Please just remember this next time you watch this film.  While dolphins are valued by many, they are targeted by many as well as a way of easy money-making.This film is more of a sugar-coated production, although it certainly is beautiful, as are the dolphins seen in the flim.  I would recommend a film entitled "Dolphin Defender" for those who seek some informative footage behind the scenes to what really happens to dolphins in drive hunts.

First, I thought I bought it for my great old days. But it's not. I really love it, and I can't stand watch it and watch it again...!!Hi Studio, would you please release THE 2nd SEASON!! almost 2 years waiting? O..come o
It's just like the Hit TV Show!  In fact they probably got the idea for the TV show from this movie. Actually I thought it was more of a comedy than anything. I saw it on the "WE" network.It's worth the price if you feel like buying it.
The third movie has nothing to do with book 3. If you loved the books, you will find this movie completely unbelievable. Kirk Cameron should be ashamed of himself for being in this piece of garbage.The first two movies are pretty well fdone and true to the books
OK, this definately looks very promising.  I saw a version of this on the Flix channel about three nights ago.  It was good.  If that is any indication on how good the show is then this Collector's Edition Box Set of the older series should be better.  I am going to purchase this soon.  Once I purchase it, I will let you know how good it really is. I'll give another review once I purchase this boxed set and have an opportunity to view the episodes .A month ago is when I really learned of this series so I am truly looking forward to watching this series.  Goddess Anjanee :
beware! this is not the tv series as described by the first reviewer (not the reviewer's fault). this is instead, the movie version of "return to treasure Island", and the tv version is by a different distributor
i bought this dvd collection to use in a presentation i made for a graduate school class to complement a book review of murrow. this collection is facinating for people who love murrow and those who've never seen his work. i will use this collection in future presentations that i'll make to my students as a professor. EVERY PERSON IN BROADCASTING SHOULD BUY THIS COLLECTION AND WATCH IT to get a great look at the man who innovated our business
This disc is pure gold! Featuring a FULL live performance from their 2004 European tour and tons of classic and backstage footage this is the ultimate Stray Cats fan collectible! The concert documented on this disc is so satisfying you would think it was still the early 80's. They show almost no signs of age and you can tell they pour their heart out into the show. They go through all their classics and then some. Whether it's "Stray Cat Strut" "Gene And Eddie" or "Rumble In Brighton" what you see and hear on this disc is flawless. Must buy for ALL music fans, not just fans of the Cats
if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you. ninjaman, elephantman, nitty kutchie, boom dandemite, harry toddler, and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie; which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick. the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format, but it still shines despite these flaws. the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists. i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately, because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick, and doesn't do bad at all at the acting thing...
If you're looking to hear Robert Johnson's songs, you should probably buy one of the awesome collections availible.  As this legend and musical genius has now been dead for 65 years, I'm not sure what the other reviewers were looking for besides other people covering his songs, and talk about his life... that's all we have now.  And of course the covers do not outdo him; that would be impossible.  But there is some very thoughtful discussion on the life of Robert Johnson and the world he lived in.  The discussion with a former classmate is touching, and the covers of his songs by those who knew him (Robert Lockwood Jr., Honeyboy Edwards)and by some of the new delta-blues talent such as Guy Davis, Roy Rogers and especially Alvin Youngblood Heart blew me away.  Gov't Mule and Sonny Landreth do some awesome electric renditions of his work.  The major let downs are the cuts into interviews and pointless displays of the rock n' roll hall of fame gathering, and also Bob Weir's performance, which is just plain bad.  All in all, it is a good film, and it's nice to actually be able to watch people play his music, as we will never be able to see the real thing
This movie is such a breath of fresh air. Finally there's a movie that's profound, amusing, and relatable. It's nice to watch something that really hits home without begin cheesy or overdone and you can never go wrong with Jean Louisa Kelly or Amanda Peet
In 1987 and 1988, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER aired and became an instant showpiece for television, a truimphant (but short-lived) series breathing fresh life into nine lesser-known northern European fairy tales and, later, into four timeless stories drawn from Greek mythology. These old folk and fairy tales, mined from countries such as Germany and Russia and compiled in 2 discs here, along with the Greek tales, are vigorously and appealingly narrated by two storytellers: John Hurt for the European fables and Michael Gambon for the Greek re-tellings. But, with much respect to Mr. Gambon, who himself does a fine job, it is John Hurt who decidedly draws my attention. Hurt, with the more eye-catching portrayal, is ideal as he inhabits his storytelling character with a gleeful and quirky charm and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. It doesn't hurt that the stories featuring Hurt as the host boast clever and sensitive screenplays written by Anthony Minghella, who, nearly a decade later, would win an Oscar for directing THE ENGLISH PATIENT. As such, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER gloriously lives up to its titular billing. John Hurt's performance sparkles with his enchanting delivery as, propelled by his captivating voice and effectively off-kilter mannerisms and abetted by heavy make-up, he evokes a rich verbal miasma which sucks the listener in to his stories. Minghella's screenplays are replete with rich, witty wordplay and evocative descriptives that indeed recall to mind the classic fairy tales with which we grew up. The kids, of course, won't have that frame of reference, but, still, watching these episodes, it really does feel as if you're sitting around the fire, enraptured at the feet of a master spinner of yarns. Michael Gambon, on the other hand, is burdened with the weightier and grimmer Greek tales. Thus, he eschews John Hurt's light, ebullient touch, opting instead to display a more proper and somber persona. He's pretty good, mind you, but, in the final analysis, he ends up lacking a bit of something when compared to John Hurt. Both Hurt and Gambon, by the way, are accompanied by the same mangy talking dog (as operated by Brian Henson). At a half hour per episode, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER is presented in a marriage of live acting, creative animatronics, and surreal and stylishly vivid imagery. Jim Henson and his crew do a marvelous job with the production values, coming up with excellent special effects (for its time), seamless puppetry, matte paintings, and yeoman make-up work, all to plant the viewer firmly in their fantasy setting. A charming quirk of the series, which adds a nice touch, is the interesting ways the folk tale would continue to make its presence felt during the occasional interludes with the Storyteller and his dog. The camera would cut away from the story and focus on our host by the fireplace, but, somewhere in the background, whether it's on a painting in the back or on the surface of a display jar or cup, images depicting the story are set in motion. Pretty neat. The stories themselves are more mature and darker in essence than any kid's fable we're used to over here, especially the Greek entries, and several carry melancholy and bittersweet overtones ("The Soldier and Death," "The Heartless Giant"). But don't keep the kids from watching this series; everyone should get a chance to fall under the spell and feel the power of stories. It does help that most of these tales are little known in the States, thereby giving the viewer a chance to enjoy the unfolding of a fresh story and be actually startled here and there. When was the last time CINDERELLA or BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, timeless as they are, offer up anything new? This is just about as perfect as television shows can get; the only flaw I can come up with lies in the dvd set as it comes with no special features whatsoever. ALL the episodes are superb, but if I had to pick the best of the pack, I would definitely go with "Hans My Hedgehog," "The Soldier and Death" and "The Three Ravens." With several recognizable name actors lending their talents to this series, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER: THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION truly is a MUST HAVE dvd set.**************************************************************************SPOILERS follow. The nine European fables:"Hans My Hedgehog" - From an early German folk tale: A barren peasant woman, desperately craving a child, naively says aloud that if she had a baby, she wouldn't care what it looks like. Soon enough, she gives birth to a baby who resembles a hedgehog, much to the father's dismay and the scorn of the villagers. "Fearnot" - From an early German folk tale: A carefree, absent-minded boy who never scares goes on a strange journey to learn fear. Though still very good, this may be the weakest episode of the lot. Gabrielle Anwar has a tiny nonspeaking role."A Story Short" - From an early Celtic folk tale: The Storyteller himself is in the spotlight as he narrates the time he was caught making a fool of the royal cook and, as punishment meted out by the king, must tell one story a day for a year. All goes well until the very last day when the Storyteller suffers from storyteller's block. Brenda Blethyn has a part."The Luck Child" - From an early Russian folk tale: Seeking to avert a prophecy which foretells of a seventh son of a seventh son of someday supplanting the current king, the unscrupulous monarch seeks out this luck child and attempts to do away with him. But those blessed with luck cannot be undone...and the same could be said for prophecies. The Soldier & Death" - From an early Russian folk tale, this is an awesome story. Because of kind acts towards three beggars, an honest soldier returning from war is given a magical sack, a deck of cards, and a nice whistle, which he uses to save a kingdom and to foil Death."The True Bride" - From an early German folk tale. Shades of Aslan! A white lion comes to the aid of a girl (Jane Horrocks, LITTLE VOICE) being held under the cruel care of a troll. Co-starring Sean Bean."The Three Ravens" - From an early German folk tale: A wicked witch (Miranda Richardson) weds a widowed king (Jonathan Pryce) and then, recognizing that the king's three sons and daughter pose a threat to her ambition, transforms the three sons into ravens. But the princess (Joely Richardson) escapes and is told by her brothers that, unless she remains speechless for three years, three months, and three days, they'll be trapped in their raven forms forever."Sapsorrow" - From an early German folk tale: This is a variant on Cinderella (or is it the other way around?) as a beautiful princess (the unimpressive Alison Doody), seeking to escape an arranged marriage, flees to a distant kingdom and disguises herself as a loathsome hag. But, then, she falls in love with the prince...Co-starring Jennifer Saunders."The Heartless Giant" - From an early German folk tale: On the whole, giants are benign creatures, harmless to none, unless, of course, the giant hasn't a heart. This story is about a curious prince who is fooled into freeing one such heartless giant from the king's dungeon...The Greek myths: "Daedalus and Icarus" - The inventor Daedalus and his son Icarus flee from the wicked King Minos with the aid of Daedalus's man-made wings, but will Icarus heed his father's advice? I'm guessing, not."Orpheus and Eurydice" - The musician Orpheus descends to Hades to bring back his dead wife."Perseus and the Gorgon" - The hero Perseus faces the Gorgon, Medusa."Theseus and the Minotaur" - It's Theseus, with some help from a beautiful princess, versus the savage Minotaur, half-man, half-bull.
  This is the first movie I remember seeing as a kid.  I LOVED it.  It was my favorite.  Then, I didn't get to see it again for several years (stupid Blockbuster!)  When I finally saw it again, I STILL liked it.  I like it as I write this very day.  The music is good (the background music behind the movie that nobody really conciously listens to, but helps the mood anyway).  The animation's good, too.  And I ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! (How often does that happen?)  See, what happens a lot of the time, is that people blame colors they don't like, or designs  that are annoying, or WHATEVER on the animation.  But it isn't the animation's fault!  The way the thing on-screen MOVES is the only thing the animators do, mostly.  So, if you really want to criticize the animation, look at how they MOVE, not what they look like. Do you see?   I think that, really, most of the reason that this is one of my favorite movies is that it is about BOOKS.  When I was little, my dad read me "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" and "The Hobbit"; things like that.  So, naturally, I loved books and stories.  This is practically the only movie I've seen that encourages reading so much while still being sincere.  It's obvious that the filmmakers themselves (or at least, a lot of the people working on it) actually like to read.  THAT'S really why I like the Pagemaster.     So, if you like to read, watch this movie.  If you don't (you utter nincompoop), stay away, and don't criticize what you have no comprehension of
I'm not a golfing buff, but found the story and golf very good.I enjoyed this movie very much
This movie is intimate and special. Some reviews say it is the story of obsession, of fetishism, of trivial things. However, this movie is the story of something special in a young teenage boy's life: his fantasy woman.    The character Malena rarely speaks throughout the movie, but we see her exactly how we are supposed to see her- through the eyes of an old man telling the story of himself in young "love". This perspective makes her ideal and special, with few flaws,as a fantasy woman is to a young man. Malena is instantly a likeable character, not awful and disgusting like those using her.    We cannot forget that our narrator, Renato, is not actually a teenage boy but an older man telling his own story. Therefore, he is unreliable as a narrator. Malena's sins are washed clean through his judgement, and we believe him when we see her victimized by the other women. However, Renato has had years to think about everything, to contemplate what really happened to her. So, in the end, the people who use her are completely despicable, unable to garner any liking.    Of course, she is a victim, but she eventually falls into the gossip that others believe she is guilty of with the men. The movie does offer a hint that she could have escaped all of the problems: she is from another city and her husband, for most of the movie, is dead. Yet, she chooses to not escape but to stay, and her fate is sealed.    The music in the movie was nominated for Best Score in 2000,and it is beautiful, emotional. It truly adds to the feeling of the movie.     I would recommend this movie to anyone for the compelling story, emotion, and characters. You will never forget this movie.
Excellent presentation and goes into detail, much of which may be unknown to the viewer.  One minor criticism:  the participants let Stanley Lord of the Californian off much too easily
These days I want laughter in my life and Katt Williams gives it to you in The Pimp Chronicles.  I thought Kat Williams Live was great, but this one was better!  His tell it like it is and living life approach is great. If you can't go to see him in a live performance this is the next best thing. Be prepared to laugh so hard your sides ache.  Keep an open mind and go for the ride! 
Just today I randomly selected a movie, that movie was "Henry".  I had never heard of it before, and I figured that I was in for your average, run-of-the-mill low budget slasher flick.  Though it is low budget, it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie.  In fact, the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study.Meet Henry, a very quiet and serene man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition.  Watch as he goes to work, watch as he hits the bar with his buddy Otis, and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random people.  This film does not exploit the violence though; it is very frank and direct, treating it as though Henry were doing nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the park.This movie is a lot of things, and when it was all over, I just had to sit back and take a few breaths, have a cigarette - and try to gauge my reaction(s).  I was surprised to note that while this film is disturbing, it is also pretty funny in some parts, though only funny in the blackest sense of the term.  There is no social commentary in this movie, nor does it provide any closure.  The DVD is great, awesome extras including fragmented interviews with the genuine serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, awaiting lethal injection on death row.  Very fascinating
I loved the artistic topics of Art & Music in this particular Little People DVD.  And I have to say, this is one of our favorites.  But I do agree with the other reviewer about the duplicate episodes showing up in each DVD.  If you have other LP movies, then you will feel slightly dissapointed to see the episodes repeating themselves here and there.  I also agree that the menu setup could be better, with all 10 episodes playing back-to-back, rather than split into 5 at a time the way they currently are.  Otherwise, this is still a great DVD - much better than the LP Storytime Collection
Very pleased with the quality of the product and the timely delivery
This is the definitive lesbian love story that launched the genre in a new direction.  Out of the dirty bars and masculine flannel shirts, away from the creepy angst of punks.  This wonderful love story brings lesbian love into the light of day with beautiful women, looking and acting sexy, and leading productive, respectable lives.  WHY NOT portray lesbians as beautiful, educated, clean, classy, talented, sober, drug-free, non-violent, non-"self-destructive", straight forward, honest...oh, and truly SEXY??  The Reno landscape in the 50's is a great backdrop for the conflicts that lesbians encountered.  The filming is top notch, the sets and period clothing are spot on.  The musical scores are superb!  The cast was wonderful!  Charbonneau and Shavers are sensational as total opposites who eventually become drawn and attrated to each other.  Just a masterful duette of performances!  Cay, free and fully out, forward and knowing just what she wants; Vivian, tentative and reluctant to step outside of her cultured and closed box.  Every minute they spend with each other oozes electricity and sexual tension. Two georgeous women making love??  HELLO!  The love scene is landmark.  Audra Lindley is wonderful and perfectly cast as Cay's stepmom.  Cay's best friend, Silver, is absolutely a key role in the dynamics of these chracters; she is the definative support and validation that these women are wonderful people, and deserve love and happiness.  We all need a little "Silver" in our lives!! This story is completely intriguing, and HEY, what a wonderful ending!  SEQUEL, SEQUEL!!! This is an absolute must have in any collection.  Timeless tale of the beauty of lesbian love.  
I don't usually like these type of movies, but this is a can't miss...you'll laugh
We all feel alone at times... this is something 'lost in translation' brilliantly shows its audience.. Indeed loneliness often, paradoxically, occurs in highly populated areas.. It is as if the more people we are surrounded by the more alienated we feel - the more our differences stand out... Bill Murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity guy, who dosen't seem to quite know why he is where he is, and why he is treated the way he is - in a culture and a pace of life so distant from his way of seeing and experiencing reality.. This is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola.. It captures hotel life in a way that only direct experiene could top.. This also sort of represents the zenith of Bill murray's career and perhaps his best performance to date.
I thought the video was well done.  It was good to feature the clinchinggames of the Division and League Championship Series plus all four gamesof the World Sries.  I think they should have included at least the high- lights on a extra disk of Games 1 and 2 of the Division Series againstBoston and Games 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the League Championship Series againstLos Angeles.  Still, I highly recommend this collection for all gung-hoWhite Sox fans who cherish the memory of the most exciting season in 88years.  A great viewing companion for those cold winter nights
I really don't have much to say about this book holder, not that it's just a book holder.  It's a nice one.  It does it's job.  It's a little too expensive for just a piece of plastic.It's strong, sturdy, and it's big enough, even for those massive heavy textbooks, like the Calculus ones.  Although, I would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that's like 6" thick (even though it still may hold).  It's got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place, although those tend to fall off when you move them.  But that's no big deal.  Just put them back on.  This book holder is kind of big, and I would not put it on a small desk in the middle of a classroom, but it's not too big.  You should be able to put it almost anywhere when studying on your own time. 
I got this card last month and I've been using it heavily. Its been great. Its sturdy and can has great range. There are a few problems though.#1 There is no case for the card.#2 The included browser only lasts for 30 days and its horrible. Luckily I had NetFront 3.1#3 Memory Stick LAN software will occasionally error, but a soft reset will fix it.Otherwise its a great little expansion card
Works great!!!  I have a flat roof that does not allow me to add a phone line and the only way to use my satilite system is with a long phone cord accross my room.  This jack extension helped me eliminate the long ugly cor
Excellent value -- these batteries are just as good as name brands for about half the price.  If you use a lot of AA's, this is the way to go -- made especially nice if you use them as a filler to get your shipping free on your entire order if it is hovering in the $18 range
I bought this 2 years back and still it is in great shape. Recently i forgot compact flash in my shirt pocket and went for washing and then followed by Drying. My wife found compact flash in dryer and i thought it would not work. Surprisingly it is working fine and i could see my past snapshots with out any problem.
IT's a USB hub. All I ask is that it works. It does.
I've had this card for about 1 1/2 years now and it has performed flawlessly. It has seen thousands of photos (no exaggeration!) on my digital camera and now holds data/mp3s for my palm too. Did you know you can pop your SD card out of a camera and into a palm to view photos? I just learned this. Anyway it's a nice product and I'm about to get another SimpleTech with 512 megs or higher if they have one. If you are new to SD memory, always get more storage than you need because eventually you'll buy something that will use one (camera, handhelds, cell phones, etc. -- note that many cell phones use a smaller "MiniSD")
I read the other reviews on this bookholder and wasn't so sure about it.  However, after buying and trying it out, I have no regrets.  Don't know why I waited soo long to get one (dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one).  Although made of plastic, it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding.  The clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold.  Unlike other models, this one folds completely flat so you can carry it in your backpack between books.  I have used it mostly for softcover textbooks and have no problem
The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures.  When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent. 
I like to purchase service or replacement contracts on all my electronics needs, just set back and relax....YOUR COVERED. 
I recently purchased this item for my wife who has a small office.  the reception on this unit is great.  Bieng in a steel building she is able to get all the local radio stations. The sound quality on it is perfect for a small room considering the price range it is in.  If you are looking for a booming sound this is not for you but it will provide a solid quality sound. 
Not quite as powerful as I was hoping for, but the sound is alright and in a small room it'll do fine.Careful, there is no plug-in at the back, so you can only connect MP3 or auxiliary stuff through the little front jack.Otherwise it's easy to use and pretty cool-looking... ideal for quiet listening, lame if you host a big party and need loud stuff
Cool! I can expand my-single-USB-port-laptop more flexible.From single peripheral to be quadruplet. I can plug Flashdisk, mouse, external and digital camera in same time. Worth money for usefull gadget
Just a note to those who've been having trouble opening these cases, without breaking them. If you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together, you'll be able to open and close it ok. Don't sand too much, and just do the top knob, or it won't hold together. I like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive, so I wanted to make them work. Hope it works for you
Sandisk, leader in this kind of technology products sure do not come short with this one. It works excellent on my phone Samsung t609.I would have bought a 1GB but the phone manufacturer do not recomend it, so bear that in mind. For pictures the resolution at close range and bright light is just excellent. For music as an MP3, lots of memory and room to fill as well as for video. Data and in general is terrific...just like I said Sandisk leads the competition and also seems to be the the standard card for just about any product that requires this kind of card. I will most definitely and undoubtely will not accept substitutions. Only Sandisk is extremely reliable. Personal experiences with these products proof it repeatledly. 
Bag is attractive and very sturdy.  The computer fits securely and is well padded.  I recently used it on a trip and was able to place other carry on items in it and it traveled well
I have had my Handspring Visor Deluxe for 5...yes, FIVE years (actually longer).  While I take decent care of it, it has taken care of me.  My doctor has one too...exactly like mine and we often talk about how perhaps they should be replaced, but the darn thing is still working great and does everything we need it to.  I finally ordered a new PDA with all the capabilities of my laptop and am passing this one on to someone else who needs it. (I'm not selling it...good karma)  Down to business - the Handspring Visor Deluxe is not the creme de la creme anymore.  But in its day it was.  Great product and if you don't need the bells and whistles (or color display)...go for this.  Totally flawless.  People often complain about the styli of other PDAs.  No complaints here.  Not only is it relatively comfortable, it is stainless tipped with plastic on both ends (doesn't break) and it stays securely in place when you store it in the device.  I literally lost my ORIGINAL stylus just a few days ago.  The display is not as easy to read as the new super crisp glossy screens that are out now, but if you need a basic device with a few bells and whistles that are thrown in for fun (heck, a good deal of the new ones don't have IR)... go for it.  And for the price I just saw it listed for on Amazon ($85) it's a total steal.  Great product
This is a high quality, precision made piece. I'm very particular about the construction of things that I buy and this Peerless arm more than met my expectations. It was easy to attach to the back of my 32" LCD television and equally easy to mount to the wall. I read a review of another arm where the buyer complained that there were many pieces to assemble. Not so here. Everything is assembled except for the mounting plates that attach to the back of the screen. All hardware is included along with clear, complete instructions. I'd be surprised if you could find something better
Like so many other small home office users, I have recently upgraded my network to 1000mpbs to help increase productivity.  Unfortunately, I originally purchased a GigE 8 port switch from another mfg. that used a fan on their switch, a VERY noisy fan.  After a month of listening to what sounded like an airplane engine, I tossed that unit and purchased this 8port Netgear GigE unit.  It is SILENT.  Basically a plug and play item due to its unmanaged nature, I have had good data thru put and no problem.  It comes with a small clip on stand for vertical storage if desired.  The unit is finished in an attractive gray and chrome exterior.  It is also small enough to live on a desktop with sucking up valuable real estate.So, if you are looking for a switch that will not be stored remotely in some closet, this is the one that will keep the peace in your office. A+ ****
Not quite as bright a conventional flashlight, but certainly bright enough. No battery feature can't be beat. Manufacturer claims it will stay on for a hour with a one minute wind. I've never left mine on that long, but I've only needed to wind it once in over a year. This is an excellent flashlight. I've bought several
This is a surprisingly good radio at this price. It is small, compact and yet very robust and quite heavy. It is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store. Here are three things I really liked about this product: 1) The AM/FM reception is outstanding. I am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear. Listening to FM on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure. 2) The buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function. This is something Sangean seems to get very well. 3) The multi-level display lighting can be turned OFF, or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright. A few things I didn't like. The pilot light for "ON" is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night. I had to put black electrical tape over it. The AUX input is a mini-jack instead of RCA connector. Minor inconvenience here. And finally, the cabinet is nice wood, but the finish is not as good as I think it could be. This radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than I expected for this price. It's a keeper
This receiver puts out a lot of power. It also has a bit of weight to it. It comes with a microphone to automatically adjust it for optimal surround sound. The remote take some getting used to but it is great how you can hook up a DVD player, CD player, radio and many other devices. The display is nice. You really have to read the manual before you start plugging away. If you're a surround sound fan on a budget pick this up
Outstanding item. Plenty of room to carry dvds. Enough padding to protect the player, but not too bulky
After reading several reviews on portable speakers, I decided to purchase the Sonic Impact i-F2 for my iPod.  It has great sound quality, the case is durable, it packs away easily and you can take it anywhere.  You can listen to music while its charging and the sounds system is quite attractive.  This is by far the best accessory I've purchased for my iPod.  Did I mention that it has a remote control!!
The Belkin TuneTalk is fabuous for using an iPod as a digital recorder. I have had very good results recording various music rehearsals (children's choir to big band) with and without an external powered microphone (Sony ECM-MS908C stereo mic) attached. Since I already had the mic, the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a Zoom digital recorder for this type of recording. I haven't plugged it into a mixing board yet. I suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a Mackie 1202 or better.I bought a USB power adaptor so I wouldn't have to worry about battery drain. It plugs into the TuneTalk and provides power to the iPod.No, it isn't as good as a high dollar recorder, dedicated mic-pre's and a pair of Neumann mics. Serious recording requires serious equipment. However, for all those other recordings, the Tunetalk Stereo is a great recording option for about $60 and your trusty iPod.
Good product, great combination of screen protection along with a small flexable piece to cover the keypad.
I have to say this mouse pad has far exceeded anything I hoped for. When I first opened the box it was shipped in I was very put off. There was a Very, Very strong chemical smell. I chalked it up to something in the packaging material. It turns out that was not where the smell was coming from. It was the mouse pad itself. Having worked in a shoe factory years ago I was able to identify the smell as an industrial glue. The smell hung around for a couple of days. Now, 1 week after having received my purchase if I put my nose close to the pad, it still carries the faint smell of industrial glue. I would caution those with allergies and/or asthma to consider this prior to purchase. As an asthmatic I can say it did affect my breathing some what. That seems to have gotten better as the smelled has lessened. I have finished with my public health warning. On to the mouse pad.      It is simply the best mouse pad I have ever used. I have had wrist problems for over 4 years now. I have had swelling and pain from my right pinkie finger to my elbow as a result of console gaming and lots of keyboarding work. In the past week my swelling has greatly reduced. My pain is almost gone. My wrist sits perfectly on  the wrist rest. The pad actually cradles my wrist. The wrist rest moves with my hand, so well and with so much support, it seems to be an extension of my body. A new improved appendage. I have found myself resting my wrist on the pad even while not computing but just sitting at my desk. It truly is that comfortable. I already have plans to purchase two more for friends as Christmas gifts. Worth Every Cent! Go For It! You Will Not Be Disappointed! 
I needed extra space for pictures and musis downloads this was just right not too expensive and large enought to fit the purpose
I really enjoyed this product and the fact that its simple to use!! It clips nicely onto my laptop or I can take it off, it comes with a little protective case, and the lens slides in to keep it unexposed when you're not using.  I really like it and all its features as well
If you zoom in on the picture, you'll notice that it's actually 16 gauge wire.  I received it and can confirm that it's 16 gauge.  Wire works fine, although the spool that's held together by two bolts and nuts had one of the nuts missing.  It's not a big deal though, and my only disappointment was on my end when I realized 100' wasn't enough to hook up my 7 speakers
I was a little worried about spending almost 70$ on this bag, but when I recieved it I was so impressed.  I really love this bag! Very well made!! The crocadile pattern is a lot more prominent than the picture shows, but I really like it. To be honest I shy away from croc patterns, but it really works with this bag! I have a 15.4 in. Gateway laptop and it fit perfectly in this bag
The only reason I didn't give this item 5 stars is because I have only taken it on the road once, so as of yet I can't call it a worthy 'road warrior.' However, it is certainly a great case. Proportioned well and good design, with space for essentials. Would recommend for anyone looking for a good case for their 17" widescreen notebook
OEM charger failed. Replaced with this one -- it's more compact & functions well
I've had my E-10 for around nine months and have been most impressed by it's performance. My interests in radio pretty much revolve around A.M.(or medium wave) DX'ing and shortwave listening. It's performance on A.M. is on a par with the highly regarded Kaito KA-1103 which I received for Christmas this year. Shortwave performance is very close, however, the Kaito is superior in this area (and features SSB tuning as well)F.M.? The E-10 is well above average but falls short of the Kaito KA-1103. I've yet to see a radio that can equal the Kaitos performance in this area, but the E-10 is closer than most.Build quality,ergonomics,and appearance are second to NONE and better than MOST. The slightly rubberized texture of this set just plain feels good when handling and adds to the to the overall impression that this is a "Top of the line" portable multi band receiver even though it's moderately priced.It's LCD digital display is one of the largest and nicest I've seen,very easy to see and well lit with a pleasant orange backlight. Other amenities such as 500 plus memories,12/24 hour clock,I.F. shift and antennae trim which are both useful in Shortwave reception,local/dx switch and the internal battery charger for NICAD or NIMH batteries all add up to make this a radio I'm glad I purchased and often recommend to those needing a radio of this type.Even the accessories included with this radio such as the carrying satchel,earbuds,and reel-up shortwave antennae are top notch! Now, if you're wondering why, after all this praise I only gave it a four star rating,and not a five it's because Eton did not provide SSB tuning capability on this receiver. And it's a shame because it's shortwave performance is good enough to utilize it. In my opinion they shortchanged this otherwise exceptional radio. Hence they only "hit a triple"(which is way more exciting nonetheless, I'm a baseball nut too) and not a home run
very good product.. actually came with a bonus 8 cd sleeve to attach to a car visor for free. very happy with the produc
The GOOD: We plugged in our new LNS2651D on 3/7/7, about an hour northwest of Tampa Bay.  Right out of the box,with an old Rabbit Ear antenna, we received five HD broadcasts.  The picture is amazing in both color and clarity.  The BAD: We reset the sound coming directly from its speakers, but because of speaker location underneath/below the screen,it lacks sparkle, esp at low to med. volume. The UGLY:  Imagine sending your intelligent,pretty young daughter out on her first date, with shoveled-on make-up, and wearing a cheap black vinyl dress.  The "Piano Black" case on this tv is a nightmare!  It shows a rippled effect, which gets distracting and even more tacky when outside light shines (even lightly) on it.  I'm hoping after the R&D department who designed the case, is sent to Siberia, they redeem themselves by designing a Matte Finish slip- cover for this otherwise excellent TV
Very pleased with the high capacity cartridge with my Epson Stylus CX6600.  "Compatibles" do not compare
When I first got a wireless network at home I purchased a Kensington WIFI Finder.  It worked fine.  But as time went on I saw these smaller versions come out from Chrysalis Development.  I heard they were more powerful and more versatile.  So I bought one.  I was NOT disappointed.  Since it was about the same size as my keyless entry remote for my car, it fit perfectly on my keychain.  Also it has a much longer range than the others.  But best of all, it is directional.  Meaning I can simply turn my body while holding down the button and the LEDs change instantly as the signal strength increases or decreases.  What a great product. I Love it! 
Product performs per specifications and is easy to use.  Would like to see fuse easier to replace
I did a bit of internet research for this, and a site devoted to luggage was RAVING about this. What can I say? They were right, and it is just an unbelievable value. I love it. I got it because I do alot of walking for my commute, had started a class that required me to do alot more to get there and the book was massive. My back was already complaining about what I was carrying around on a daily basis. I ordered it and it arrived in 2 days, My back was and is so grateful.It is tough! the sidewalks aren't in the best shape, and I'm always pulling it up and down over curbs and had a couple of days of ice and snow, and the wheels are scuffed up but still no worse for wear (although the little pad on the bottom for cushioning your hip if you wear it over your shoulder fell off, but why would I want to carry it like that anyway). Very well designed, with plenty of compartments, and padded computer sleeve is removeable. It maneuvers well, is light with a comfortable handle and strap (gel-like). I can grab it by the handle and walk up the metro stairs with no problem.A quality case for a great price
The mouse itself is very nicely designed and cool looking. I use it with my Apple Mac G5. The optical tracking is great, no moving parts. The scroll wheel is indispensable for browsing the web and scrolling through documents. I just wish the software that comes with it would be more stable, less buggy. I had to uninstall it and use another mouse driver with more options, functions and less bugs
I needed to have an s-video feed from my classroom computer to a projector and to a TV/Monitor.   This proved to be the most cost-effective solution to the problem.  It works just as hoped
This card was easy to install and works well. I have very little experience even opening a compter box. Making a spot for the connection to come out of the computer case turned out to be the most difficult part.
Since there is now relatively few choices for a good corded phone (esp. with caller ID), this phone is tops. This phone and all other AT&T phones corded or cordless, exhibit slight feedback when talking loud or when hanging up.  But no other phone out there seems to be nearly as durable.  Given the other choices, this is the one to get
These DVDs never fail...I've tried other brands and had miserable results.Stick with Memorex and you won't be sorry
My daughter is very happy with the product. She not only got the MP3 player she wanted, she also got her favorite color "PINK". Thought we got a great deal and it has been working wonderfully. Infact, my son is now jealous that his younger sister has a better MP3 player than he has
What I ordered - on time delivery - good price
i already test a loot of mobo... asus, msi (my last was k8n diamond), and others... but this board looks like no other, and realy works!!! for gamers is the ultimate board... i really recomend it!
These buds are definitely a step up from the standard iPod buds.  They stay in your ears much more easily (without the foam black covers, which are easily lost), the sound is at least marginally better, and the overall construction seems to be better.  You can't do much better for the money.However, if you're willing to spend a little more, the JLab JBuds are the way to go.  I own both the Gumys and the JBuds, and the Gumys are my workout pair, and I use the JBuds for everything else.But if you're looking to spend as little as possible yet still upgrade from the iPod buds, the Gumys are the way to go
This cable really cleaned up the display image. I had been running another Monster Cable - the 6 meter version. I needed the length before because of the way my system was configured. I have a review under that cable about how quality does matter.And so does length. At the time I wrote the review I was just ordering the cable and was posting what I had found out in researching digital video signals. Everything in there stands true.I changed my setup and decided to invest in a shorter version of the cable - the 1 meter version - because I could now get away with a much shorter cable. I installed it this morning and the difference, while not earth shattering, was definitely visible.I use this cable to connect between the video card on a media PC and my TV (Sony rear-projection LCD). The image used to swim a little along the edges of some windows, text, etc., and the image wasn't as clear as I had hoped. While the image looked good, it didn't look great. That's why I decided to take the plunge and spend an extra $79 bucks.The difference is somethine like going from a regular RF feed to your TV and component video cables. Now the image is crisp and clear and there is no swimming. It actually brings out detail I couldn't even see before - to the point of deciding to turn on FSAA and filtering so video games have a more realistic look. And that they do.I don't know how other brands compare to the Monster Cables as I haven't tried them. What I do know is that signal integrity is very important to a good looking display. You can get that with high quality cables and by keeping the length to the absolute minimum required as there was a very perceptible difference just between the 1 meter and 6 meter versions of the exact same thing.One more thing while I'm here. I want to thank Amazon for going the extra mile on customer service. I had a DVD disappear somehow during shipping. UPS said they delivered it but I never received it. I asked Amazon if they filed the report with UPS or I did to file a claim. What I got was a reply telling me a replacement was already on its way. That is service. Thanks Amazon
I love this product.  Unfortunately, I blew mine up in West Africa (my computer was not damaged), so when I returned I ordered another right away.  I wish that it were a little thinner, but I suppose you can't have everything....at least right now
I got this yoke to use with Microsoft Flight Simulator.  Other people have said that the build quality is poor on this yoke, but what did you expect?  It's just a computer game controller, it's not meant to feel like an actual pilot's yoke.  If it were, it would probably be much, much more expensive!Yes, the plastic build makes it feel like just another joystick, but I've had it for almost a year and haven't had any problems with it.  Also, I rarely need to reconfigure it, so there's not an issue of "wandering" from the centre point.All in all, this yoke is fairly good and works well with Flight Simulator.  It certainly makes you feel a little bit more like you're a real pilot, but don't expect to feel any G-forces or anything else like that
If you're considering the ViaMichelin (under $200 GPS), you're probably trying to decide if a GPS that is more than $100 cheaper (much more than $100 in some cases) than its competitors is really any good. Honestly, I would have been skeptical too, however, a relative bought one of these units, and that gave me a chance to get their feedback before I decided to purchase one myself.My brief summary is that Yes, this unit is a good GPS and a great value. After using mine on a trip, I'd have a hard time justifying the more expensive models when this one works fine.Background: my GPS experience is limited to a 7-year old Garmin III Plus. I had to plan detailed trips on my PC using Mapsource, then upload the waypoints and routes to the GPS. It could be a time consuming process, and because the unit wasn't necessarily user friendly, my wife never learned how to use it.Enter the ViaMichelin. We just went on a weekend trip and had a chance to test the unit. Set-up time for the trip was about a minute - all I had to do was program in the street address of our destination.Now for the rundown.First - what it doesn't do well.a) Using it for the past two weeks (as a test only) around my home town, I was a little disappointed.  It never sent me the wrong way, but it didn't always take the best route.  Some of the routing issues were because of very new road construction in the area; and in some cases old "logging" roads are still in the database where new subdivisions have been built; and it may not calculate what my experience dictates to be the better route. Although this was disconcerting at first, I don't think it is a big deal as you'll see later.b) Macro-directions - i.e. for a several hundred mile trip. It will get you there, and if you're taking a route that involves some smaller roads between towns, this would be a good device if you aren't familiar with the route. But my route this weekend was very simple. Get to the interstate and drive. It didn't pick my preferred route to the interstate, and it wanted to route me through a city before putting me on the interstate when you can take a four-lane road for 4 miles to another connection to the interstate. (Although it did recover and finally suggest my route as I stubbornly drove "my way.") So, for a major trip, I'd recommend an internet mapping package for the primary route.  Use this device if you have a lot of mind-numbing turn-by-turn.Now, what it does well:a) voice prompts are great. It doesn't matter that it doesn't say the street names. Turn right in 300 feet is good enough - especially with the map that you can glance at.b) It did great around my destination towns of Charlotte, NC; Gastonia, NC, and Rock Hill, SC.  Did it take the best route as I drove from soccer fields, to hotels, to restaurants?  I don't know since I wasn't familiar with the areas, but the routes seems to be just fine, they got me exactly where I needed to go, and I never had to look at a road map.  And after all, this was the main reason I needed a newer GPS. It passed this with flying colors.c) My wife did some of the set-up while in the car. She'll be using this one on her on very soon.d) We wanted to find a particular restaurant, but didn't have the street address. The restaurant was in the Points of Interest database, and it took us right to it. Also, finding rest stops or nearby dining while traveling on the interstate was great.I also found a feature that was not listed in the 89-page manual.  From the navigation map, if you touch the screen, it has a "bypass route" option. It will give you some distant options (1 mi, 5 mi, etc.) then it will find a bypass route for you. So, if you are approaching road construction or a traffic jam, this will route you off the interstate, take you up the road and bring you back on.  Obviously you could just turn off the interstate and start driving, but then it's going to try to turn you around and/or try to get you back on sooner than you prefer.  The bypass route lets you see where it is taking you by zooming out.In the future, I would like to do a side-by-side comparison w/ a more expensive (borrowed) GPS. Also, after more experience, I'd like to update this review.Bottom line: I am glad I bought this unit. I cannot imagine spending $100-$500 more on a more expensive model. Though the higher priced models may have better features, the value for the extra money just isn't there for me
I got the Griffin iTrip to enjoy my iPod in my car, and then I HAD to get a Belkin TuneBase for iPod mini! With the short battery life that is further aggravated when using the iTrip, the TuneBase keeps my iPod charged so that I don't have to plug it into my computer's USB port every night after work
I love the Sling Media Slingbox Tuner!  The install was very easy just as they had said on the reviews.  The quality of picture is just as good as on my Cable TV.  I have a great processor with the highest internet speed I could get though my cable so that may contribute to the good quality picture and color I get with it and may also be the reason I have had no problems with doing computer work and watching the screen at the same time. Plue my shipment from Amazon was in 2 days!  You rock Amazon!
After reading several reviews of this product I was skeptical about buying this cable.  I wanted a better cable then the composite rca cables that came with my PS2 but I was not sure about paying the price for these when the Sony cables are about half the cost of the Monster Cables.  The reviewers commenting on the cable not fitting into the PS2 properly and the component connectors being too tight to fit onto the TV almost discouraged me from even buying this product.  I decided to bite the bullet and purchase these cables for my PS2.  I am very happy that I decided to buy these cables.  The cable connector fits perfectly into my PS2, better than the connector on my original Sony cables even.  The connectors fit nicely onto my TV, they are snug but not too tight.  I believe they fit snuggly onto the component jacks on my TV because of the 8-cut turbine connector, which fits better than a standard RCA plug.  The video and audio from my PS2 is unbelievable.  My PS2 pushes the video signal to my 32" LCD HD TV at 480i with these cables.  With my stock composite cables the graphics in my games were grainy and sometimes blurry.  Now the graphics are crisp and clear and I only wish I would have bought these sooner.  The display from my PS2 and games fits nicely onto my TV in widescreen now too, before the picture was not centered on my TV and sometimes parts of my game screens would be off the screen.  I would recommend these cables to anyone who wants to improve the video and sound quality of their PS2 over the stock Sony cables.  There are other Monster Cable versions for the PS2 available so choose the one that is right for you, but if you want something that is moderately priced, don't need digital audio via fiber, and the next best thing to HDMI than this is the cable for you.  I am going to get the Monster component cables for my PS3 next so I will be able to hook it up when I don't have HDMI available for it to use.One more thought, be sure to change the video output on your PS2 from RGB to Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr in the system configuration before hooking up your PS2 with these cables or it may not work.  My TV told me the connection was not supported and I did not have video output until I changed the video output setting on my PS2
Needed the adapter to charge my Shuffle, since the AC adapter I have is one of those older Apple ones with the Firewire connector. Suits my needs perfectly.No experience with any sound docks, however, so I can't comment on the performance flaws other people have brought up
Length of ownership: 8 weeksThis puppy really reaches out. My laptop's internal intel/pro wireless sees about 6 networks but with the Hawking dish a typical haul is 20 networks. Thanks to some friendly neighbors I've said goodbye to my paid isp and now enjoy casual and free internet connections, and until metrofi completes its set up of free city-wide wifi I'll get by with that thanks to this neat Hawking device.Unless I need the next and more expensive step up for such wifi booster devices I hope the Hawking dish proves durable..after all it's been just 2 months of ownership so far, albeit good ones.Note: For me this device has not seemed very directional in that it will pick up off-beam signals fairly well. Also, placement by a window will help your reception
I also purchased this product because of the quality of the receiver made by Sony. This 7.1 channel Home Theater with HDMI passthrough is a great machine that money can buy. If you are looking for quality, surround sound in your livingroom, or your own Home Theater, this s the product you should invest in. This is a great investment for me. I am glad I found it in Amazon
the Klipsch igroove can go toe to toe with the more expensive bose sound wave all day long. I researched dockable ipod / mp3 players for a few months before I decided on this one for my wife's office. I'm fussy when it comes to quality audio equipment, the I-grove does not disappoint. It provides room filling sound with no distorion. I listened to it extensively before wrapping it up for xmas to make sure it had the quality I insist on. It delivered.Another bonus with the Klipsch is it's ability to accomodate other mp3 players and / or personal compact disc players.I'm completely satisfied with my purchase of the Klipsch i-Groove.
I can't describe this MP3 with words "great"It's more than great.It fits my pocket, and it's music quality is great.My sister and I bought this incredible MP3 with doubts but, it is more than great.If somebody is considering buying an MP3, I strongly recommend to buy this iRiver.Thank you, thank you, thank you
I bought this for my new Sony Ericson W300i phone so that i could actually put some music on the phone. It came with a MS pro adapter which is nice because I have a slot on my computer for that. It is fast and just what I wanted
I purchase this on Amazon for $499 no tax & free shipping. You can not match this quality at this price. The HD with HDMI cable using Comcast digital box is outstanding. The sound is also better with the HDMI vs componet cables. The jacks are hard to connect in the back of the set and you need to set the picture to manuel mode. The picture is to red on the preset modes and looks like there is too much color. I looked at Samsung for $800 and I am glad I saved myself $300 with this LCD
I purchased the LJ3390 to replace an existing LJ3320.  The $350 rebate available until the end of Oct was the deciding factor as it made the unit a very reasonable purchase.My main interest in the upgrade was to purchase a network connected printer.  Duplex print capability was the other factor that tipped the scale in favour of the LJ3390 over the LJ3052.I now have 3 desktop and 2 laptop printers all printing successfully.  All run XP SP2 and are either connected via a wired or wireless network connection.  Software installation went flawlessly.While I can't comment about HP versus other vendor software, I can say that the LJ3390 software is a major improvement over that of my LJ3320.  Scanning is faster by at least a factor of 2X, quite likely more like 3-4X.  Printing of complex pages is also much faster, exactly what I would expect from a newer generation print engine and an HP Laserjet printer.All in all I am very pleased that I upgraded.  It has met all my upgrade goals.  Printing is faster, scanning is much faster.  The network connectivity ensures anyone can print without another machine being forced to be a print server and constantly left on.  I haven't played with the fax side yet, but am hoping this finally let's me retire my trusty standalone fax machine.
I bought this for my daughters Sansa e230 mp3 player and could not be more satisfied. I was leary of the price, but this unit is worth every penny. Recharges your player and has awesome sound for the size, while plugged in or with batteries. No regrets about this purchase
this is good for when you go on a trip you know it will keep your streetpilot going. and it isn't bulky. and it's made with quality just like the streetpilot itself
I ordered this product and it arrived 2 days later. It is genuine Canon ink for a great price. I will definitely buy at amazon.com again
Very easy to assemble, has very classic lines, lets stereo equipment have plenty of ventilation, hard to find add-on shelf in maple. Holds a lot of equipment
I used to buy those cheap $[...] red laser pointers at gun shows and flea markets, just to have some fun, but the batteries didn't last long enough and the beam wasn't bright at all, not to mention that it made more of an oval dot than round.  I bought this one thinking that it would be really cool because it was green.  I thought the high price tag was pushing it just for a little green dot, but it is much more than I thought it would be.  The beam is clearly visible in the dark and you can even see the dot on the blackest street in the middle of a sunny day.  The range is incredible and makes street signs reflect hreen shimmers!  I love it!  A much better buy than those crappy red ones, and the AAA batteries are easy to replace and last much longer
This is a great radio for sailboats and other boats that do not have a 12v power supply
I just added this to my Onkyo HTIB system and it's made all the difference in the world. I'm a bit of an audiophile (on a reasonable budget), with four subwoofers scattered throughout the rooms in my house and one 10" Polk in my truck. I'm most satisfied with the Polk subwoofers for their tightness and ability to pound low frequencies without turning the sound into a boomy mess. I listen to a lot of music with double-bass drumming and thought that this PSW12 would have a tough time keeping up with the quickness of the 10" sub I like so much. Not the case. What I get is very quick bass with that ground-shaking impact that I always look for.I'm still going easy on 'er for the break-in period, but I can say that the trailer for Kingdom of Heaven (included on the Blu-Ray disc) sounds absolutely stunning. Paired with my 57" Sony HDTV, trips to the movie theater are few and far between these days. Now is a great time to pick up one of these, since the price seems to have recently dropped by about $50 throughout the web.Unbeatable sub for the money!
This product has worked great with my 2Wire Gateway modem from AT&T Yahoo.The real plus has been the USB connection so its not necessary to take off the desktop's back panel. The connection has been good, and I set it up in minutes.I tend to think that people who are having connection problems have a problem with their router, and not this device.  I can see 50%+ networks from all over my neighborhood
I had great hope for this product.  It has, mostly, so far, lived up to my expectations.  Here are some caveats...I was hoping for the ability to set up music catagories...easy listening, dinner music, light jazz...etc.  You have to "cheat" to do this, and using the manual is daunting.  Instead of using the "Artist" as artist, I used it as a catagory code, ie making one artist light jazz, etc.  This works, but you do, of course lose the artist registration ability.So now, I can select "artist" "Dinner Music" and then "All Discs" and "Shuffle", and the unit will play a track from one "Dinner Music" CD then shuffle to another track on another "Dinner Music" CD, etc, making a delightful, mix of music that never is repeated exactly the same way.I am still in the loading phase of coexistance with this machine, so longetivty, and flawlessness are not being reviewed here.  That remains to be seen.The manual is purely awfull.  Just dig in and try things.  That's the only way to get a handle on things.  Hope this helps....good luck!
We received this item very quickly.  It was exactly what we ordere
This radio has excellent features for someone who is either new to shortwave radio or just wanting a simple, user-friendly set of controls.  Also perfect for those that like analogue-style controls that would be encountered on older radios.  I have the S-350, the model that the S-350DL replaces.  For general world band programme listening, this radio is fantastic.  Outstanding speaker.  Easy to read digital display includes backlight.  Includes attenuator.  Clock can be set to 24 hour time.  Easy to carry anywhere.  Robust antenna.  Does not support SSB tuning, which you would need to tune in Ham radio.  Same radio sold under Tescun name in other parts of the world
Every house should have a Grundig S350 Deluxe. Big, brawny, "grabbing" in all the hard-to-get stations with ease, championing a big antenna that says this radio means serious business, the Grundig S350 Deluxe version, is a bigger, better version of the old Grundig S350, eliminating some of the "drift" problems of the earlier model. The speaker on the Deluxe is bigger and brighter. Whereas your fancy digital preset radios often sound like tin, the Grundig S350 DL has depth. Is it a perfect radio? No. You don't have presets in spite of the digital read-out. You get a little AM overload. Here in Los Angeles I get overload on 1150 so that I'm listening to two shows at once. Also the cheaper (and cheaper built) GE Superradio boasts an internal AM ferrite antenna twice the size and as a result gets slightly better AM.If you're looking for a radio with similar features as the Grundig S350 DL but erases its weakness--no presets and AM overload, then you might want to check out the Grundig G4000A. It's the same price as the S350 and its speaker is surprisingly good for a digital preset shortwave radio. Or you might look at the stunning Kaito 1103 or its more expensive cousin the Eton E5. But even if you get a fancy preset radio, every house should have the big easy-to-use Grundig S350 Deluxe.Update: Comparing the S350 to the same-priced G4000 for several months, it becomes clear that the G4000 is a better buy: superior AM, superior separation of AM stations, presets, same warm speaker, and smaller.
"My husband and I bought this for our new home and we're both thrilled!  He loves that it holds our new TV and stereo system, and I love the way it looks. It's extremely sturdy and he was able to put it together in less than a couple of hours. We're so glad we found something we could both agree on!  What a great piece of furniture!
This compact mini was exactly what we needed to use as a server for our photography studio. All computers can pull from it with no noticible slow down. It was the smoothest install and network to our 6 computers. I will buy another very soon to use as a backup to the first
I already have two of these for my heavy rear bose speakers. The speakers are about are about 10 lbs each and are easily handled.The mounts are solid, and can be oriented in any direction easily. I am about to by three more for my center, and two fronts.I highly recommend
Im not a professional keyboard player. I bought this keyboard to have something to play around in with reason and Guitar Pro.  It suits those needs great.  Its detects right away and withing minutes you will be playing. The keyboard itself is extremly small reminds me of a kids toy keyboard.  If your looking for something more professional you will probably have to fork out the $100 bucks and get the bigger model. 
This is a great card for a laptop, however they need to correct their problems with the installer for XP. Also to get thru to them for any help is a major challenge, took me 4 days to get thru on their 800 line. Once you do get to them they fix the problem right away, seems they know it will not install correctly. Then it works great
I've been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years.  I've used these for 8 months now and wear them almost everyday.  I ride a motorcycle everyday and I never leave without these.  First, the comfort is exceptional.  Even with my helmet on, I never get uncomfortable with these in my ears.  I've ridden 400 miles at a time without any problems.  Even when I need a break from the music, I leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise.  I've used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable - tolerable at best, but most are painful with a helmet on.  The "bulb" you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear, so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep.  Second, the sound quality is fantastic.  Great bass, mids, and highs.  I've heard things in my music I never knew was there and I can't wait to listen more.  I can't recommend these enough.  I've bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine
I am an IT Director and bought these for exercisers for my users. The outside is like a balloon, only much stronger rubber, and the inside is gel. When you squeeze them, the part that squeezes through your fingers changes color - it's cool! The resistance is very good and my users love them! Good product - great value and excellent quality
     I did a lot of research, not wanting to rush into anything and then regret it after seeing something else a week later. I was about to buy the newest 40" 720p Samsung for $1899... then I stumbled upon this one at Circuit City for $1999 and bought it on the spot... paid about $50 for delivery and had it in my living room about three hours later. I've had it a week now, and I love it.     Standard-definition picture quality is just okay, but are any of us buying these TVs to watch SDTV? I get about 15 HD channels through my cable company, including all four major networks plus ESPN, ESPN2 and a couple music and movie channels. Therefore, a majority of everything I watch is available in HD anyway. SDTV content still looks decent from the typical viewing distance of 10-12 feet. HD content looks awesome (including black levels), and my cable provider broadcasts in only 720p. I can only imagine how good 1080p content is going to look once it becomes available.     I'm going to wait another year or two for the High-Definition DVD format war to play out before I buy a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD player. But I've watched standard-definition DVD on my Xbox with this TV, and the picture is beautiful. I'm sure High-Definition DVD would look a little better in a side-by-side comparison, but you will not have any complaints watching standard-definition DVD on this TV.     In short, this is an excellent TV, especially compared to other 1080p  models in its size range. If you're looking for something in the range of $2000-$2200, this is the one you want. Enjoy
Works as advertised, I needed longer range and it provided, easy setup, stable connection
If you like to listen to audio tapes you will like this one. Replacing the provided headphones is a good idea. FM reception a little weak, but the tape play time on ONE AA battery is amazing. Lightweight and good quality for the price
 Compact flouresecent bulbs will not fit this fixture unless you order special CF's with extended bases. Other than that, it can't be beat for the price and quality. Adorama Rocks
I purchased this so my PC could share a monitor with my XBOX360.  Does the job at a cheap cost!  So easy to use that my 4 yr. old can use it
My criteria for my new printer purchase was:1. 11x172. individual inks3. reliable printer company4. easy installation/good customer service5. price (this was a bit pricey but the next step up was not a choice)So far for my needs this has been a great printer so far.  It does great quality prints for photos, school projects and more.  I wanted to have more versatility to make posters, labels, photos, etc...  My last HP wide format printer (1200c) lasted for over 5 years and I took it everywhere.  I have only had this for a few motnhs but it hasn't been a disappointment yet
The XMB-10 is a great way to listen to my XM Audiovox receiver at home. The boombox is slightly larger than I desired, but the sound is great, it's easy to use, lightweight, very portable and nice looking.
I would give a high recommendation for this TV.  It is the perfect size for a bedroom especially if you're not looking to overwhelm the room but you just want something to watch a late night movie, the morning or evening news, or the late shows in high def.  DVD player works great and really completes the package as it seems not to increase the size of the TV at all.  The picture is outstanding and isn't that what really matters in the end??!!  The only little annoying thing concerns what would have been a great feature but has a big limitation - the TV has an auto-on feature so that you can use it like an alarm clock but it requires that you select a channel on which to tune the TV once it goes on.  It you are use the HDMI as I am to get signal from your cable box, you must have the TV input mode set to HDMI but you can't set the auto-on to the HDMI input (it must be a channel number).  The engineers just didn't think that one through all the way.  Oh well, still a great TV
Great soundcard!  I noticed in Battlefield 2142 that I can hear the sounds of footsteps behind me better.  I'm not getting knifed as often (which is a very good thing!)  I'm glad I got this card
This is by far the best radio I've ever had for singing in the shower.  No more fumbling and messing with the dial while I've got soap in my eyes... 10 fm presets, 5 am presets and 5 tv presets + weather, I'm always able to find something good to listen to.  It works great for when I'm out in the yard doing some work as well. 
It is very small and looks very cool.you can charge it very fast.ts sound is very good too.t has radio function too
They are great for putting DVD's, CD's in.  They arrive in great condition
I love this remote.I was afraid that having a NON-TIVO brand unit (Toshiba brand TIVO unit) would require lots of setup (testing dozens of codes before finding the right one).Mine worked just as soon as I put batteries into the unit.The buttons are quite intuitive; I never used the user's manual yet.A real winner.An inexpensive replacement for the real unit
Having a bad view of the southern sky, I needed to get a outdoor antenna for my sirius radio.It maded all the difference. Great product and it came with 30 ft. of cable
The lable maker was removed from the box and put into action with ease.  Product is easy to use and understand.  For the money a great purchase.
I bought this deck about 6 months ago. It has performed flawless in every aspect. As soon as I turned it on I could notice a big difference in the sound quality from my old poineer deck. I have taken all of my cd's out of my truck because there is no need for the cd player if you take advantage of the ipod interface. The ipod function is flawless and easy to use. Just plug in your ipod and search by artist, album, song title or playlist. This can get a little tricky while driving ecpecially if you have a large library so I would suggest using playlists. The output of sound quality from an ipod is amazing. Also there is a very useful bass engine that is very useful if you have subs, this function allows for flawless bass output and easy ajustment. This deck is the best overall I have ever listened to
FANTASTIC sound for the money!  (seems to work well with Asus P5W DH, anyway)  Nice crisp highs, decent mid-range and unmuddied lows make this an excellent pick, IMO.  The only down-side I could find is some of the nonsense-software included is, well, nonsense.  Creative scores, again
I love green tea pocky. it's flavour is indescribable! it's sweet, yet light. you can only eat a few though, before it's enough for ya. I'd suggest that everyone try these, they're that good. :D also, the strawberry pocky with little chunks on them are awesome too. ^_^ try them
10 stars! I haven't had a fluffernutter since I became a diabetic, which was about 40 years ago. This stuff is too good to be true...no aftertaste, great consistency..
This was a no brainer for my pregnant daughter!  When those cravings kicked in, she had plenty of treats!  Also used them for snacks with lunches.  Buy baggies to sort in individual serving sizes
I was actually anxiously waiting to try these since the reviews were mixed but I am soooooo glad I did try them bec now i am hooked!!!! Yes, they are a bit expensive when compared to pasta but i think of it as paying some extra bucks to remove some pounds off! I make sure I rinse them really well in cold water right before I boil them for around 5 minutes which removes all the bad smell! I just add some marinara sauce and it is a done deal! I found the texture to be actually good , like a firmer version of the ramen noodles! I think these make an excellent snack or meal!
I eat this on Peanut Butter Toast for breakfast everyday and love it. I think it's a great product. As good as regular marshmallow dip? Probably not. But, if you want a hint of marshmallow with no calories in one serving. It's good stuff.
I liked these.  I was prepared for an awful stench upon opening the package, but mine didn't smell at all.  I followed the instructions and was pleasantly suprised by the taste and unique (unique = good) texture.  These noodles weren't like pasta, but they were good.  I'll have no problem eating them agian.  As a matter of fact I thought they were quite delicious
so i was just thinking one day about cheese and i says to myself, i says to me like.. it was something like this i go "i beg amazon half good selection for it and me" so i then say this french chese AND I ORDERED IT RIGHT AWAY! i dont half it yet in the mall bet i bet its going to be bes chees i every have

Yummy Green Tea Pocky!!!!!  Just make sure you purchase this in the fall/winter months, otherwise it'll melt in the mail.  I would've given this 5 stars, had the Pocky not melted together into a lump
We just tried this excellent cheese sampler package...The quality is superb,  and i have just ordered their 4 pound package...The cheeses are of excellent quality..You cant go wrong...An excellent buy..5 star rated
This is the candy our two boys ask for the most. And their friends (and their parents) love them, too.  We gave them out for Halloween and had rave reviews back from neighbors. It's great to be able to give out candy to trick or treaters and to guests that we know won't hurt anyone (no peanuts, no corn, no artificial anything). Just great taste!  Rock on, Yummy Earth.
If you've missed your favorite pastas because of your low-carb diet, this definitely is the product for you. Though it doesn't have the starchy quality of pasta, it's a convincing substitute if you're don't mind sacrificing texture for a low-calorie, low-carb meal. Be sure to drain adequately before you top with a sauce, otherwise you end up with a slimy mess. Otherwise, I would recommend this product to anyone who misses pastas because of Atkins, South Beach, etc.
****Tazo Assorted Black and Green Teas and Herbal Infusions includes one or two of each:AWAKE:  plain ordinary black tea, a little bitterCALM:  nice chamomile teaCHAI BLACK TEA:  an okay chai black tea with caffeineCHINA GREEN TIPS:  great green tea experience, Tazo's best, no "natural flavorings"DECAFFEINATED CHAI: an okay chai black tea without caffeineEARL GREY BLACK TEA:  a disappointing perfumy, intense, black tea experience LOTUS:  decaf green tea with lotus flower, one of my favorite Tazo'sPASSION HERBAL INFUSION:  hibiscus-y, intense, caffeine-free, and luxuriousWILD SWEET ORANGE:  orange herbal tea, some complex overtones perhapsZEN:  mild, relaxed green teaTheir ingredients include: black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, citric acid, natural flavors, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, rooibos, ginger root, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflower, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise, and red poppy flowers. Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.Overall, the green teas seem good. The herbal infusions are fine. The black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. Tazo's assortment, and Tazo teas in general, are fine---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as Numi, or Aspen, or other super premium teas made with only "real" ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. I'm more used to these high quality teas, which Tazo attempts to be, but disappoints...so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. For this review, I'm rounding up, since so many people seem to enjoy these teas, and I'm in the clear minority. If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality, no doubt Tazo's teas will appeal to you, as they are a great improvement. They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. If you don't enjoy Tazo's teas, though, know that there are many, many teas made with all real ingredients, teas that cost only a fraction more, that may be just the thing you were looking for. ***
My husband and I were introduced to Market Spice Tea in 1984 while we were living for a few months in Seattle.  We loved it and, upon our return to Jamesville, NY, begain to regularly order it.  Many of our friends now order it, too.  It is an ideal hot drink in the winter and equally good iced in the summer.  23 years and counting it is still our favorite tea
Try something different.  Forget microwave popcorn for a few weeks and try this four-pack just once.  At the very least, you'll have a new food experience, but what you might get is a new family tradition.  It's worth it.My wife and I received a four-pack of Fireworks Popcorn last year with these four flavors, and because we are huge fans of stovetop-popping popcorn, it was a definite treat.  We love watching movies, and it's a weekend tradition to make a giant tub of popcorn and jump on the couch.This 4-pack is a fantastic way to discover the differences in types of popcorn, and there really are subtle differences.  There is a description of the flavor on each bottle, and the bottles also tell you about the size and robustness of the finished product.  As gourmet as any other gourmet popcorn I've ever tried, the kernels pop up nice and big and almost every kernel pops.  The flavors augment a good low-fat butter spray if that's your fancy.  I'm very much looking forward to receiving the 8-flavor sampler!Personally, I pop mine in olive oil with a few dashes of garlic-infused oil and/or the red spicy olive oil and a little salt.  That is something you can't do in a microwave!  If you've never popped popcorn on a stove before and you're intimidated... no worries.  Pour in enough popcorn to cover the bottom of the pot, add enough olive oil cover up about half the height of the kernels, shake it over the heat until the popping almost stops, and pour out the popcorn into a bowl asap.  Practice makes perfect, and you don't need much practice at all... maybe just one try!Honestly, for the labor of about 90 seconds on the stove and one pot to wash, you turn an evening of TV-viewing or movie watching into an event.  The kids will love it, and as a grown-up kid, I highly recommend it.  I have fond memories of my dad making popcorn for the three kids on Saturday nights, and this is a good product to make those memories
This tea is really out of the ordinary, and I think people either love it or hate it!  I LOVE it!  It has a wonderful flavor and is one of my favorites.  Give it a try; you might be pleasantly surprised
I really enjoyed this soup. The flavor is delightful plus all-natural ingredients and low fat make it a healthy meal
Apparently the Gift Basket arrived on time and it was enjoyed and appreciated by my Dad.  Thanks for your integrity and creativity
Besides being a very good deal for the price, this item thankfully does not contain lavender, which is not commonly used in French cuisine but is used rather to freshen clothes chests. However, the classic mix of herbes de Provence for cooking usually contains one additional herb: marjoram
Well, it worked out great because they were bought for a friend who now resides in California but is originally from New York.They arrived in a timely fashion and they were in good condition and enjoyed by all.In fact I would order them again.
From Italy's famed milk region, Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz and Tuscan 2% Low Fat Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz are guaranteed to satisfy. The birthplace of the Italian Renaissance is also the birthplace of the world's most delectable beverage, Tuscan Whole Milk. Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Dante Alighieritable were known to imbibe in Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz's sweeth frothy goodness. Some say that Milk was the inspiration for the Mona Lisa.Now the milk growers of Tuscan have released Tuscan Skim Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz...a lighter taste with less creamy overtones. In my opinion, an improvement over their earlier release and is my libation of choice. Bon appetit
I found this syrup to be quite tasty, on apples, and other things, or even on a spoon. You can use it to drizzle on things, instead of honey or maple syrup. You can use it in making rice Krispisy. truely, golden syrup is wonderful
I love this popcorn.  I buy loads of it so I never run out.  I don't know why this isn't the most popular popcorn out there.  I don't think people know about it, or maybe they don't want to have to cook it.  But it's so easy and good
The recepients of this gift loved it!  It arrived in time for Christmas and was well packaged
This was the best experience. I had mixed feelings about ordering food products and from a new company with Amazon but it was wonderful. The leaves are just great and taste great too. They were very appologetic because of weather it shipped out a couple of days late BUT I still got them ontime. I can not wait to use all of the leaves to order (as well as more ingredients) from them.
I won't claim to be a professional food taster ... I just know what I like and don't like.  I don't like "yellow" popcorn, I don't like microwave popcorn, I like the "white" popcorn cooked in a pan.  For my "popping style" the Baby White pops great w/o lots of hard kernels.  'nuf said
Item as expected, services average; shipping cost wasn't as ecconomical as I would have liked to have seen but, obviously, I paid it.  I probably could have found the tea in a store but am hard pressed to get anywhere, so...  All-in-all, everything went as expected
*****Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent "natural flavors" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these "natural flavors" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor." This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as "grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey". Tazo describes the aroma as "vegetative, popcorn". I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.****
The tomato, the other other white meat. It's whats for dinner.
WOW!! This is awesome.  You guys have everything!!! I ordered 20 for valentines day.  They serve as the lining of the valentines day baskets that I am donating to my local church.  After they dig into the delicious assortment of candies and fruit they can rejoice that they will find a fine fresh rabbit for stewing later that evening.  Now if I only had some taters...
This oolong simply tastes richer and fresher than any other my husband and I have tried.  We live in the hinterland of Utah without any variety of oolong teas on most market shelves, so we are happy to purchase it online.
I am an amateur indian chef.  This spice is one of my favorite spices to use when I am cooking.  It is such a versatile spice, adding an exquisite flavor to any and all dishes.  It works well with a lot of different foods.  If you are in any way interested in cooking Indian, get this spice....NOW!!!!!
Silver Needle White Tea is the finest tea I have ever tasted.  The flavor is delicate without being weak and there is no bitter aftertaste as with the majority of teas.  Because there is less caffiene, I did not experience the jittery, nauseous feeling I get from other teas.
I have spent many years walking the Earth, much like Kane, and I've seen many things. Some of them legal, some of them warranting several eternities in Hades. But I have never before bared witness to purple potatoes. Seeing as that I am such an adventurous chap, I decided to give them a whirl. If nothing else, I told myself, they would make delightful earrings for my wife, Maude. She's something of a tuber afficianado, don't ya know. Upon their arrival at my abode, I happened to notice that the delivery lad was wearing a bio-hazard suit and that the potatoes were being transported within a lead container. Thinking nothing of it, I opened the container and proceeded to eat them raw. Imagine the surprise and delight when I felt my very DNA being torn apart and restructured. I now write to you all from the cave I share with the cyclops, seeing as how I am now 37 feet tall, have a spiked tail, horns, and nictitating membranes over my eyes. Did I mention I am a lovely shade of violet now and breath fire? All thanks to the delicious pommes de terre
These centipedes are wonderful! They have a lot of flavor and last a long time!
I bought some of this after seeing it featured on Food Finds.  At first I thought it would be a good alternative to cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving but it's even better than that.  It's not tart like regular cranberry.....even with all the different tart fruits in the ingredients, it's surprisingly smooth and surprisingly good.  I've tried it on ice cream, with cheese and crackers and have even put it on barbequed pork.  So far, it's been fabulous on everything.  I just keep trying to find more things to try it on!  Will definitely be buying this one again
After growing up in Africa, one becomes rather fond of Rooibos tea and I never thought the day would arrive when I would recommend anything but a pure Rooibos tea. Tazo has taken Rooibos tea to a new level by blending African Rooibos (red bush) with hibiscus, lemon myrtle, lemon verbena, orange peel, rosemary, and lemon balm.Rooibos has quite a distinctive fragrance that reminds me a bit of a fragrant flowers waving in a warm afternoon breeze after an African veld fire. I remember mixing in a tablespoon of condensed milk as a child. Now I mix in powdered milk and honey. Honey seems to bring out the rich flavors in this particular tea blend. For some reason, this blend is rather delicious with a toasted and buttered cinnamon/raisin bagel.I've recently rediscovered the health benefits of Rooibos although I can truly say I've been drinking this tea for most of my existence on this planet. Rooibos is naturally sweet, very aromatic and is high in magnesium, calcium, iron and copper. Mothers in Africa will often add an infusion of this tea to a bottle of milk for babies to cure colic. An application of cold Rooibos tea can also aid in clearing the skin or is recommended for allergies, indigestion, insomnia and nervous tension. Just drinking the tea seems to improve your skin due to the high antioxidant levels, 50 times that of green tea! This is one of the Tazo teas that should not be steeped for too long because of all the delicate flavors. If you enjoy this tea, you might also want to try Tazo Honeybush tea. I must say that the Tazo company really has my attention with their packaging, amusing tales of ancient Tazo wheels and they know how to blend tea to absolute perfection.~TheRebeccaReview.com
LOVE these!  These are a great treat at any age.  I bagged the giant cola bottles, giant crocs and gummy bears in a treat bag for my 4th grade students.  They were savoring the giant cola bottles.  I don't blame them.  I find myself chomping on them, too.  I don't even like coca cola
If one has to be on a restricted diet and finds a company, or in this case a bakery that supplies treats to those who can not eat regular sweets, this wonderful bakery is the answer.  Their bagels, danishes and doughnut are very good.  Yes, they are smaller than the usual portions, but the quality is A+.  They have packed their danishes in regular cake pastry boxes and their doughnuts in plastic form cases to protect the doughnuts.  The Service is excellent.  They ship on Monday through Wednesday with two day shipping.  I am a regular customer, especially for their hearty low carb bagels
I highly recommend these onions. They are absolutely fab! Great in anything from salsa fresca to roasted pork. They are even great on their own or fresh. Just don't let the wife smell you
Product came in good condition and was DELICIOUS!  It is expensive, but very good
I love Market Spice tea and wish that it was something I could buy locally.  The only downside is a short shelf life, but I keep it in the refrigerator and voila! I enjoy a daily cup of tea
I am a Seattle native who constantly finds herself living either abroad or on the 'other' coast.  As an avid tea drinker I frequently find myself with other epicureans and always try to convince them that Market Spice tea is the greatest tea blend EVER!!Now that I can buy Market Spice on Amazon, I can finally prove it
I'm very pleased with this tea.  I boil a pot of water and then take the lid off and let it cool to the right temperature, which is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  I let it steep for about five minutes and then remove my infuser and pour myself a cuppa nice, light oolong.  It's good and relaxing.Arrived in the container seen in the picture, with the tea sealed up in a little plastic bag inside of it.  I'd recommend it
I have used this flask for about a month now - I absolutely love it! I purchased this based on the reputation of the Bodum brand. I have never had a problem with any kind of leakage or spillage. It has tipped over before with no problems, I highly recommend this for anyone
I tried making my own fondant 3 times with no success.   Trying to stir the muck recipe books told me to make broke every wooden spoon I had.  This is SO EASY!  The instructions are right on the bag--you just add it to melted butter!  So simple, much easier than everything I have tried in the past.  If you want to make your own candy this is what you need.  Save a wooden spoon, buy dry fondant today
Wonderful for eating as a snack right out of the can or in cereal.  Not hard little rock-like things, but real blueblueberries
This product really does work,especially in the stir crazy popper.It makes crunchy popcorn every time
I enjoy Starbuck's version w/melon flavor in latte and frapuccino. At home I just blend mine with vanilla soy milk which I think tastes awesome
I went to UK for the first time a couple of years back. My friends introduced me to Marmite as something some people enjoyed when they couldn't afford eggs and bacon. The Mr said it was made from a by-product of beer, I thought he was joking at first.  Spread it thinly on a piece of dry toast, served properly, he demonstrated then handed to me. It was surprisingly strong but I liked it. Savory [or savoury as they would spell it] like bacon or other cooked meats but none of the awful fat or grease. It's not terribly hard to find here since the advent of shopping with the wonderful world wide web, so I have been able to enjoy this in the US as a snack between meals on one slice of whole wheat bread, often a late night sandwich with room temperature cheese and tomato. 
I was treated to this sauce while in Canada for a friends wedding recently.  I have to say, it is easily the best steak/brown sauce I've ever had - it's sweet and tangy and spicy all at the same time, but not overpoweringly so.  The sauce seems extremely versatile and would be excellent over steak, poultry, burgers, fries - and I'm sure would be a fantastic marinade as well
Received as a gift from my wife (I'm the cook) and it makes quick work of herbs, fresh berries for yogurt or anything you need to smash
The "crema" was pretty thick as it brewed, and the coffee appeared to have a nice dark color. We got a nice strong aroma of coffee and preceded to add some milk (1%) and sugar. Our first impressions...good flavor...a nice cup of coffee. We did enjoy the cup of coffeeWe don't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it's really good! We love the way it smells - the way it tastes - and the fact it is just plain different. Most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent - and it's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee! Review from singleservecoffee.com
Yes the coffee is the best quality, pesticide free.  There are technical issues with the pods. 1 pod was broken when I opened up the pouch it was stored in.  For any pods to arrive broken when they are so expensive is just not acceptable.  Also, many times the pod is not working, but turning it around and pressing down on it with a fork or a spoon makes it work (I have Black & Decker Home Cafe Machine).  Great coffee, but I felt that I had to really work for it.  I also feel that to charage $15 to ship a box of coffee pods is a bit excessive, considering that they are being shiped from LA not HI
Adagio has outdone themselves with this creation.  Jasmine Bloom Display Tea starts out as a tight ball of leaves, the size of a quarter.  Add some hot water, and the ball unfurls it's leaves of Jasmine green tea revealing a strand of delicate white flowers arching over the green tea starburst.  The aroma is a delicate, perfumed scent of Jasmine blossoms, the color is a pale green, and the taste is light and mellow.  The hand-tied tea blooms are nicer to look at than taste, however, I recommend trying this tea just for the fun of it.  
I develop sugarfree recipes and find these eggs invaluable when adding extra liquids to an existing recipe. To date I have not been disappointed in any of the baking results yet. I would and will purchase these again
Great product, arrived in good condition.  Shipping cost made it unlikely for me to order it again
As always there products are just mouth watering and top grade.
I gave it my friends.They says it's very good and delicious
I have been impressed by tazo's China Green Tips Tea. Strong is an understatement! Great tea - I have throughly enjoyed i
Whatever you do, dip these in milk when you eat them.  Not for long, just long enough for saturation.  They are out of this world.
I gave G collection to my wife.  It's perfect Valentine present for her!Most of chocolates are fruit-based but very unique and fresh.I'm not a big fan of chocolate but this one is amazing
     I use almonds in cereal, cake and bread, both for nutrition and taste. For years, I've been grinding my own. This is a high quality product that saves time since it's already ground. The price is highly competitive
Recently having moved to the midwest, I longed for something different such as the wonderful Japanese food that was so readily available on the west coast.  I was so happy to come across Fugetso-Do on Amazon! I placed an order on Monday evening and by Thursday it had arrived! It was still cold, tasted very fresh and just delightful. Very soft..not rubbery as i have sometimes found in other vendors. Completely satisfied my craving. Would definitely order from again!!
The green tea is excellent.  (and it should be considering the cost for such as small amount!)  I have to admit, I was shocked when I received the tiny little tin...the picture is deceiving.  You think you are getting a huge amount.  But you only need a small amount.  Very smooth. Overall, it is worth it. I highly recommend this tea if you're willing to dish out the cash
This is very good peanut brittle, I found no taste compromise even though it is sugar free.  In fact I found it superior to regular brands of peanut brittle I have eaten.  Most peanut brittle is hard as a rock, this brand had a perfect crisp crunch.

I am exceptionally pleased with the product and the company.  I had a minor problem with the merchandise and let them know.  I had an immediate response and the problem was rectified faster than I ever expected
I was skeptical at first as to how good freeze dried strawberries could be but they taste great, like fresh picked strawberries
This green tea has a very smooth mellow taste. I have tried different green teas and this is the best I have every tasted. I have been ordering this product for a couple of years now. If you love a good green tea, this is the one
The cheese flavor is delictible.  But, don't fall for these wimpy ones.  Buy the huge puffed Cheetos.  Those are the best.  Did you know that parents once raised a commotion about Chester the Cheetah?  They thought his cool attitude and love for Cheetos would encourage children to eat too many Cheetos and become obese.  I think this is a valid concern.  Maybe that is why we do not see too many Cheeto commericals anymore.I might add that I find the orange dust to be enjoyable.  Finger licking good, indeed, don't be prissy.  I also enjoy the orange stains Cheetos leave on your fingers after the dust is gone.  Maybe you can convince your friends you are very artistic and just finger painted a masterpiece using just one shade of orange
One of my favorites.  As good as it gets ... for what it is (prepackaged Indian food).  The flavor is authentic, and preparation is easy.  Best mixed with basmati rice.  I recommend adding chopped fresh coriander (cilantro). You might want to add a dollop of yogurt if you have a low tolerance for hot spice
I used to buy pods at Starbucks, but I started longing for something a little more authentic. Luckily, my fiancee bought me the PodMerchant Megasampler as a Christmas present. I was overwhelmed!I never knew there were so many different kinds of espresso pods available, especially from one store. The selection in this sampler is huge, and it includes both caffeinated and decaf pods.  (There is also the Super Sampler but it doesn't include decaf, which is nice sometimes in the evening).After trying these pods we found which espressos we liked best and have been buying those, but it all started with the Mega sampler. The shipping was also very fast.If you're looking to expand your coffee horizons and have an espresso pod machine, you'll almost certainly find some new favorites in here
Better than expected quality - very nice quality and very attractive.  Quick shipping and response
This salt is very good. I have purchased other flavored salts from this company and I have been very happy with service and quality.  I will continue to use this company
Honestly, as a family who is gluten free, corn free, soy free, dairy free I've tried EVERYTHING on the market atleast once. This brand of pasta is the #1 choice in our household, and the number one choice of families I know who have kids who can't eat wheat. Unlike corn pastas and MOST brown rice pastas, this one never gets mushy. Skip the trials we went thru, just buy this one.
Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea. ~The Rebecca Review
Authentic taste, long shelf life in your fridge, easy to use, and the price is right.  How can you go wrong.  When I prepare a curry with this I don't go crazy with a lot of Thai ingredients other than the curry paste.  Just some veggies from the super like bell pepper, scallions, carrots, jalapeno and serrano chilies, and some sliced pork or chicken or beef.  So easy and so delicious
They didn't lie in the description! This stuff does have a delightful flavor that is both sweet and tart. Thing is, I had no idea it would be so STRONG! These little sticks of gum pack some serious flavor, and it lasts a long time. A worthwhile buy, I say
This is the story of two Tazo teas. I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality. I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer. The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea. Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful. A romantic tea with a golden-orange color. I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold, so I end up drinking it hot and cold. Half on ice and half in a mug. When this tea is hot, it is much more romantic and aromatic. When chilled it takes on a more bitter component. For something even more exotic, try the Tazo Green Ginger tea. ~The Rebecca Review
Spelt has quickly become a favorite staple for me. These berries are great tasting and easy to work with- not to mention their nutritional value
These candies are not your typical kids sour candies...they have exotic flavors and not as tart as the others. 
When friends from far away sent a gift for my grandchild, I found this to be a better, more special thank-you.  I don't know anyone that doesn't love Godiva. When the larger package arrives they have absolutely no clue there's a cooler inside keeping their thank-you flower fresh (and delicious) from the rigorous road trip across country
This is the best candy I have ever had.  My aunt gave everybody at Christmas this candy in a red box, what a great gift.  It doesn't help my Atkins diet, but I've got to have my chocolate
In the midwest, some folks think of this as biscotti, but don't be confused. It is correctly named. It is a toast cookie, so when you dunk it be quick about it! My husbands favorite, and quite tasty, I like the small almond bits and that I can chew it without dunking (not at hard as their biscotti-See my review)
The vanilla beans arrived still moist, and plump. They're so much better in appearance than the kinds you can buy at Whole Foods or Wild Oats, which are very dry and shriveled by comparison, not to mention overpriced.The fragrance is overpowering, and the shipment comes with a nice recipe for creme brulee.  Don't throw away your used vanilla pods!  Save them to flavor your sugar
I have always wanted to like greent tea but never been able to.  My sister gave me a cup of this tea at her house and i was completely won over.  It's taste is so smooth with the mild sweetness of jasmine.  My husband and i have successfully quit coffee thanks to this tea
Bakel's "Pettinice" rolled fondant, imported from New Zealand, is one of the favorite choices for pastry chefs (both amateur & professional) worldwide. It's available in white, ivory, or chocolate, and can be purchased in resealable 15 lb tubs or 5 lb packages.Fondant can be flavored with small amounts of various flavoring compounds e.g. chocolate & pure extracts. Concentrated food coloring provides you with nearly a limitless spectrum of coloring options. The 15 lb. tub should retail around $44.99 (plus shipping), and the 5 lb. package should retail around $16.99 (plus shipping).
I haven't been able to find this product in my local grocery stores, when I found it online through Amazon I was delighted. I ordered 10 packages, they are all gone, I love them, especially to dunk in my morning coffee. If you haven't ever tried them, do so, you will love them
These beans were really fresh and lower cost than other suppliers.  The beans were shipped free and promptly
Most fruits and vegetables begin to lose a large percentage of their nutritional value minutes after they are plucked from their respective vines or branches. There is a synergy of some compounds that have a very short half-life after being removed from their home plant. When the vine is still attached (and stilly green and healthy, not withered and brittle), nutrition from the plant is still being pumped into the tomato, keeping it firm, bright, crisp and yummy - and more nutritious
Red Bull used to be my favorite drink, as I would not go 24 hours without drinking an entire can. That era has ended simply because I was beginning to get sick of paying over $2.00 for one can. I know several distributors who offer the product for $1.50, but I seldomly stock up on the stuff and end up paying the $2.00 for a can plus 8% tax, which comes out to $2.15 a can. Which is fine with me until you realize that you are spending over 700 dollars a year at this rate. It never stopped me before and I always felt that it was worth it, considering the drink helps me focus in college each morning. However, I recently noticed that on days when I was not in school and I drank a Red Bull, rather than being full of energy and ready to jog, I would become tired. I began to wonder why I would get tired after drinking a can of Red Bull. Maybe my inner body was saying, "stop drinking this **** every freaking day of your life!" Whatever the case is, I decided to stop buying it on a daily basis and just drink it when I have to wake up very early. Hopefully this can make it become effective on my body again, because I think I may have overdone it, considering I have probably consumed well over 1000 cans in my life. I personally enjoy drinking a cold can of Red Bull. Set aside the energy factor. While many people (actually everyone I know) says it is sick and makes them gag, I kinda like that cough droppy taste that is offered in a can of Red Bull. I find Red Bull to be a conversation starter for myself - kinda like smoker talk. I love to sip from my can of Red Bull and discuss the weather or some other exciting news with my peers. While I have tried so many other energy drinks, I can say that I do hate all of them. There has never been an energy drink that I enjoyed other than Red Bull. I guess I just like the Austrian people so much (and the fact that a can of Red Bull is vegan!) On the other hand, it is full of man-made chemicals that might do some weird things to me in the future - only time will tell
IN A NUTSHELL: FAST - IDIOT PROOF - MADE FOR ON THE GO - 5 CALORIESThis is really a very handy way to have a refreshing drink ready to go when water is just too bland, by itself.Just open the packet, empty the contents into a bottle of water [how much H2O according to your taste] and shake it up. Viola -- refreshment in an instant. Or, you can put the bottle [plastic] in the freezer and have an ice-cold lemonade later.WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT --'Crystal Light On The Go Packets Lemonade, Drink Mix' tastes great, has very few calories, is an ideal carbonated beverage alternative and most of all --- IT'S EZ TO MAKE ON THE GO - FAST. It's also rather reasonably priced.MY ONLY RESERVATION -- ASPARTAMESome people do have bad reactions to aspartame but most people know, by now, whether or not it affects them adversely. I would rather have 'Splenda' as the sweetener, but maybe that will be available soon.Through Kraft, there is a neat website which contains nutritional and other info about Crystal Light -  [http://www.kraftfoods.com/CRYSTALLIGHT/][I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY] 
I love garlic and have never found a great combination that has few calories and sodium. I put it on everything.
Speaking as someone who has to watch her carb intake carefully, I was not keen on trying yet another item that claimed to be low-carb and good-tasting.  So often the two do not go together, especially when dealing with the traditional, more "carby" foods such as pasta, bread, rice, etc.Dreamfields is a happy exception.  This is not to say you can cook up a whole box and eat it all at once (those who have to watch carb intake will still need to do some portion control), but you can actually have a large scoop of delicious hot pasta alone or in your culinary creations and not blow your carb allowance.  And this is not some flimsy, dissolving, cardboard-tasting pasta; it cooks up hearty and substantial.  When you eat it, it fills up that "I am so hungry for carbs, I could eat a ton of potatoes" need.  Satisfying, delicious, filling, and easier on the insulin levels than regular pasta.  I love it! 
I have been purchasing these mushrooms for years by driving to specialty stores in either NYC or Philadelphia.  Even including shipping, this is the best price I have ever seen on these mushrooms! I even received an e-mail telling me shipping may be delayed due to Hurricane Wilma, But still got the product in less than a week! I paid more than double this in a famous Philadelphia cheese shop, and the quality wasn't as good as this! I will definitely be doing more business with this company!
Great unique flavor !!  Not hot at all.  I add my own peppers for the heat, but if you want great tasting chili, use Gebhardts.  I usually use an entire 3 oz. bottle of powder with every pot of chili I make.  My neighbors love when I give them my extras when I make my big pot of chili
These cookes are so good.  I have tried many that look similar, but none are as good as these, too bad most stores have stopped carrying them
For those of you who love the cinnamon taste, this tea is by far the best I have ever had. The stronger the better!
I have to tell you, I have been a fan of spicy food for the last 20 years. I have tried wicked salsas, and crazy-hot sauces. I thought I had seen it all until I received Dave's Total Insanity as a gift last Christmas.I arrived home from work and decided to give this sauce a try. We were having rice for dinner, and I launched a generous topping of Dave's Total Insanity into the mix, and dug in.Oh, my! This stuff was no hot I had to throw out the whole dinner. I put way too much in. I never expected "nuclear meltdown." Friends, this stuff isn't child's play. Heck, I wouldn't even secretly put it in my enemy's food. I might get arrested.Dave's Total Insanity has a great taste, and is perfect for the spicy food lover in your life, but don't go slathering it on your pile of chicken wings until you have a small taste first. You will waste a meal unless you use it in moderation
These are by far the best tasting Spirulina bars in the market. The  whole line is more desert like in concept, so of course they are sweet & chewy. People with IBS probably should not eat finely chopped raw nuts and should read ingredients before buying!!The food is safe for celiac, and most food allergens (AGAIN READ THE LABEL BASED ON YOUR DIETARY SITUATION!)The bars travel very well and although they may bend and mush, because they are naturally moist and chewey, melting? Never. All the bars in this line travel great and can sit for months in hot or cold.These are particularly good for athletes and people on the run.Oh, and the price, come on, there is nothing else that even comes close for the size and quality
These cheddar bunnies are now a favorite in our house.  Better tasting and cuter than goldfish crackers, these are a good snack to give to your kids, or eat yourself.  I was very pleased with this purchase
Good low sodium low sugar granola that I feel I can't afford at the onesie price in the traditional shopping venues
I personally like the taste of this product, but I can see that others may not. The taste is unusual, with natural tones.I definitely like the packaging. Standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time, but a box of Zico survived a 2-week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine.
Just the right size snack pack for my 17-month old.  Healthier alternative to other packaged crackers without sacrificing taste
My whole family love these crackers. It's nice that they are organic with no artifical ingredients or hydrogenated oils. The only thing I wish is that they were whole grain!
We spent 5 years in Brasil and Senseo has captured the essence of the premium cafe taste from some of the better Fazendas! Well done, particularly for a Dutch company
I have purchased this item several times.  It is good and can be expanded by adding more vegetables or chicken.  It comes packaged well and is easy to prepare.  It is also in an environment friendly bowl which is important to me
I don't think that it is possible to get better beef jerky for the price. My wife and two kids also find it to be delicious
I tried this coffee on a whim. My husband and I really enjoy our single serve coffee maker. We easily use up an 18-pak in 2 to 3 days between the grown children and us. This coffee has very smooth taste and mildly strong in flavor. It is a very nice coffee that can be enjoyed daily
Wow - this beef jerky is so good it should come with a label: "Warning - Highly Addictive." Hands-down, the best beef jerky we've ever eaten. Moist, yet chewy, very satisfying. Not too salty. Lots of flavor. Think maybe I'll go eat some now...
Flavored coffee creamers have been a guilty pleasure of mine for a long time now, but even if you buy the sugar-free kind, you're ingesting a whopping 1 gram of fat per tablespoon of creamer. As if that weren't bad enough, it's partially HYDROGENATED! Splenda Flavor Blends is a wonderful alternative if you're like me and just can't face black coffee. Please note that this is not a creamer. It sweetens/flavors coffee. If you find you just have to have creamer to "tame" down your coffee you can add a Splenda Flavor blend and a splash of skim milk or if you like things more creamy, buy some powdered non-fat milk and add that along with the Splenda Flavor blends.Lots of times, I find products with Splenda already in them to be too sweet but I didn't think that was the case with this. All three of the available flavors (hazelnut, mocha, vanilla) taste great without being overpowering. Finally, now I can kick that fatty creamer bad habit!
First tried this tea from a specialty store in Buffalo, NY where it sold for close to $60/lb.  Love it, even though it was only 2 oz.  Search the net for this tea and found it Amazon.  It's a light delicate flavorful tea that can be brewed 2 to 3 times by refreshing it with more hot water.  It is non-acidic like some other teas.  It need no addition of cream or sweetner.  I'm currently drinking 5 to 6 cups per day as it is so delicious and light.  It's not exactly a green tea when brewed but a light amber color, with the hint of a flora or fruity taste. The added plus at Amazon is the price and very quick shipping.  I would strongly recommend getting this tea for any tea lover and I'm sure they would be pleased if they enjoy a good quality chinese tea
I love the flavor. It's in a world of it's own. It has great taste and textur
I love the Original Vanilla Creme Newman's O's, so when I saw the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free on sale one day I picked one up. I figured it would basically be the same as the Original. The chocolate and vanilla tastes are great, but I found the cookies themselves to be rock hard. So unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products, I would recommend the Original Vanilla Creme, and not the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free variety
When I searched the net for pods there were lots of warnings that the senseo brand wasn't so good.  Granted I am not an avid coffee drinker,however I really look forward to a good morning cup of coffee that won't burn a hole in my stomach.  I usually run one senseo pod through twice and have a perfect cup.  If anything - needs a little more of the flavor (i.e. hazlenut, vanilla) added to it.  But still very good.
I am addicted to these. They are delicious, not dry at all, and there are lots of crackers in each container. Yum!
Some people can tolerate spelt but not wheat --and if you are one of those, spelt flour makes a great bread. It substitutes well, but be aware that spelt requires less kneading (it has a shorter gluten fiber and breaks down if kneaded too long. We knead bread about three minutes.)Spelt also makes lovely noodles and is fine in cakes. It seems easier to digest. It does have gluten and is a relative of wheat, so if you are gluten-sensitive, this is probably not an alternative
This is my favorite side dish. It is so versatile and so very easy to make. It tastes great with any and every kind of sausage I've ever tried. I love to make it when I whip up a batch of hot wings
I use this cereal for not only cereal, but also to make rice crispy treats. Yum
I started using goat milk when my daughter was 1 because she did not digest cow's milk that well. This product is great, has equal or more nutrition than cow's milk, has a good flavor, just slightly different than cow's milk,is easy to digest and best of all the powder form is great if you are on the go, I don't have to worry about it spoiling I just mix and give it to my daughter
I will never make home-made gumbo again, this is so easy and good. 30 minutes and you have great gumbo.
While I like all of the Kashi products I've tried, this one has to be my favorite! With a little fresh fruit, how much more healthy can you get? Great taste with seven grains and sesame! Perhaps the other reviewer threw away the cereal and ate the box
I have been buying this brand of boneless and skinless sardines for years and still love to just open a can and eat them for a snack.  I know that being boneless and skinless lowers the calcium level but I've never liked the crunch or taste of eating a whole sardine right from the sea. And they are packed in olive oil which is loaded with Omega 3's too so it's as good for you as are the sardines.  However, I am not so sure about their actual mercury levels.  Buying them from Amazon with their $10. off sale on $49. purchases is a great price.  I've even found that many of the local grocery stores as well as Costco and BJ's NO longer carry this product.  Or their price has skyrocketed.  It's great to be able to stock pile them from Amazon.  If you like sardines, you'll love these! And they are just so nutritious for us all
I love this cereal; I eat it every morning with maple syrup or honey, raisins, and walnuts.  It is never pasty for me, as it is for the other reviewer, unless I let it cook way too long or let it sit to cool too long.  I cook it for five minutes, turn off the heat and let it thicken a couple of minutes more as I add my raisins and walnuts and maple syrup.  Then I stir in rice milk until I get it to the consistency I like.  Though I don't like rice milk by itself or on any other cereal, it does taste really good on this rice cereal, with the added benefit of making the whole thing easier to digest.  Rice cereal is the easiest cereal to digest, anyway, but adding rice milk instead of cow's milk makes it even more easier
   I tried this item just because it's a a ginseng snack.  I found it to be not particularly tasty, but the overall effect of increased stamina is true.  I'm not sure about spirulina in general, but one ball per day does the trick for me when it comes to increased stamina lasting several days
Everyone loved these pretzels. Very flavorful, not too salty. I plan on buying more from Amazon, best price I've found on this brand
Ever since I returned from Spain, I have been looking for some decent anchovies to eat as tapas. These are just the right amount for a snack and the flavor is wonderful. If you have never eaten anchovies except on a pizza, you are missing a great treat. I highly recommend these, and even if you only eat them occasionally, they will remain fresh in the glass jars
I just began baking with Splenda when we found out my dad has pre-diabetes. For Easter I prepared a sugarless ricotta tart with Splenda and it worked beautifully. Everyone agreed that it didn't taste sugar-free and my dad really enjoyed it.
Agave nectar makes an exellant sweetner for cooking as well as for teas.Agave is better for your health than refined sugars and other manufacturedsweeteners on the market today.My only wish is that will soon be available in larger containers for bulk sales and use.  Thanks, E
My son loves this cereal!!!  I always had to buy it at a health food store where it is usually almost $5 per box, so when it was on sale I would stock up.  I finally started buying another peanut butter cereal that also did not have gluten ingredients.  He said he didn't like it as well, but I thought he was just imagining the difference.  Well, I decided we would do a blindfolded taste test to prove he couldn't really tell the difference.  He was able to identify the Panda Puffs as his favorite every time no matter how we switched them around!  He has even asked for a case of this cereal for Christmas!  Guess that convinced me that there must be something to this cereal to make him like it so well.  When I received a $50 gift certificate through the Kidzeyes program as a prize, I used it for some gluten free grocery items from Amazon.  I liked the items we tried so much, I started an astore to promote the great tasting gluten free foods that are available at reasonable prices from  Amazon com.  In fact, that's the name of my astore: Great Tasting and Gluten Free. Here is the link: [...]I have several items listed, including EnviroKidz Panda Puffs, with personal reviews of each.  We have five people in our family eating gluten free and quality is very important to us!  All the items I have on my page are personal favorites. Now I order gluten free items from Amazon about once a week for my family.  Sure beats going to the health food store over an hour away and paying much more for less selection
I've tried a lot of cold coffee drinks and this one wins on all counts (even over Frappacino). I have to have one every afternoon for a 'pick-me-up' treat! You will LOVE this, I'm on my 2nd case
This is a good price for this amount of quality licorice.  This is the traditional Dutch concoction containing a strong salt taste and smell.Not for everyone, the taste of this product is less sweet but more long lasting than the licorice candies we are used to eating in America.  If you know you like this strongly flavored licorice this is a bargain
These instant potatoes are very tasty and so simple and fast to make.A nice buttery flavor and all you need is water.Will be buying more
Love this.  Great substitute for shortening.  Keeps baked goods moister, and is excellent for cooking eggs and vegetables. 
These butter waffles are very tasty- very light, yet rich and buttery.  They're hard to resist, couldn't help but eat a whole box.Only downside is that it uses vanillin, rather than real vanilla.  However, it goes great with ice cream and fruits
Having tried Senseo pods, Millstone, etc.  I was surprised that good old Folgers is just as good and in some cases better than Senseo's newer flavors.  While made for the Home Cafe these fit Senseo coffee makers and give you a good cup for a lot less than the more upscale brands
These are the best tasting lollipops you will ever have.  Because of my 2 year olds food allergies I discovered these and now her doctors office is purchasing them, even the hospital my husband works at.  These are allergy free and amazing!!!!!!!!
This is a good granola. I like that it has lots of seeds with the grainy things, and a few nuts tossed in. Nice taste. Thanks to Amazon for carrying so many gluten free items! Makes like so much easier!!
I had read other's reviews about how great this coffee was, but I was using another coffee that I thought was really wonderful.  I tried this one and now I am hooked.  It is wonderful if you like bold coffee, which I do.  I also like the fact that it is Organic.  I don't drink a lot of coffee each day, but the cup or two I have, I want to be great.  Just wish they had a decaf for my evening coffee
I started to love Annie Chun's udon soup in March 2007. Although it was on my AMAZON GROCERY LIST for many months cause i read a very bad review from a guy that did not know what is great. I just ordered many A. Chun's soup noodle bowls. And i will order more again in future. Annie Chun is a cute and talented woman and she is the 1st Asian female that i admired and read her story about her soup noodle for second time on Amazon.com  
Even non-celiac people should switch over. Here's an amazing gravy for chicken or pork chops. Try it next time and serve next to mashed potatoes: 2c. water and 1/2c. mix. Bring to gentle boil over high heat. Remove from heat immediately. Stir in 1/4c sour cream. Pour over meat, browned in a skillet. Simmer on lowest heat until meat is cooked through, turning and stirring often to prevent skorching. Hmmmm. I'm getting hungry
After reading that Bentley's has the finest Ceylon teas in the world, I decided to give this as a Christmas gift to my husband.  He says it is the best tea he's ever had, and since he is somewhat of a tea connoisseur, I would consider that a compliment.  The box is beautiful, and it makes a lovely presentation
When my kids started kindergarten they needed to pack a lunch everyday. My wife realized that this was a teaching opportunity about nutrition, making the right choices, and responsibility.Each day the kids pack their own lunches from Lunch Box Central. Each lunch must contain a protein (usually yogurt), a grain (some form of cracker or grain filled bar), and a fruit (apple, banana, or fruit cup).EnviroKidz Organic Crispy Rice Bars are a staple in Lunch Box Central. They're convenient, the kids enjoy them, and they're a reasonably healthy choice.The kids are happy, they're learning, and they're eating well. My wife is pretty smart
I just bought some of this Golden Nut Crunch from Planter's last week and I snack on it at work... it is really one of the best trail mixes I have had before.  I love it.  It lasts a while also.. it lasted me about 4 days at work just snacking on it periodically.  I would definitely recommend this snack.. It's healthy too
These peanut butter balls not only taste great but they are good for you.  My daughter has celiac disease so foods like these are really blessings in our life.  I have eaten these when I did not have time for lunch.  They are filling and energizing and taste delicious.  You can't ask for more than that!
What a deal! Great tasting treat at a good price! I will definetly be ordering other flavors and Killarney again too
By far... the best, no after tastes and will not spike your blood surgar levels, worth every penny
These might appease your sweet tooth while providing excellent nutrition in a 200 calorie natural food bar. They are not overly chocolately like those chocolate covered protein bars: the bar has delicious chocolate throughout with a terrific crunch of sesame, flax, and sunflower seeds. I'm hypoglycemic and they are perfect to keep in the car for the quick pick up to prevent the need for glucose and a true crisis. I highly recommend. Oh, I have ordered both from Nutiva and from Amazon: Amazon is less expensive and faster delivery
THE CEREAL IS DELICIOUS.  I PUT HALF OF A BANANA IN IT.  IT IS FULLING FOR ME. IT IS LOW IN CARBS AND NO SUGAR.  I AM PRE-DIABETIC.  MY SUGAR COUNT IS VERY GOOD WITH THIS.  I WILL NEED THEM AGAIN SOON
Tin container not laced in the plasic crap..  The tea is very stonge and not a mixture so you have to add flavors too it but it taste good plain too and is very strong.  Taste wise it's stonge with an inner spice like taste in it if you drink your tea how your supposed to -- not a gulper - chuckle.  It was less than what I thought from the other reviewer but it is so strong you don't need as much and I'd still have to say it's a great deal.  Just add a twist of your favorite herb like orange peal or ginger and this can be the making of a great exotic tea but the only thing it's missing is the organic seal of quality and then it gets 5 stars for proving it's grown under kosher conditions which is very important.  The tins are very nice to look at and I hate to thow them away.  Obviously they put a lot of pride in the product
Granted, this is not one of the better tasting cereals, but when you consider that it will provide the daily recommendation of fiber in just 2/3 cup, the trade-off is worthwhile.  If there is an easier way to get 26 grams of fiber, I haven't found it.  Just be aware that, if you prefer sugary sweet cereals, this definitely is not the one for you
My kids love their Macaroni & Cheese but one day all we had was a generic brand.  They didn't eat it all that well (Kraft really is the best) so I decided to try to make it a little better for them.  Follow the recipe on the box with a couple exceptions.  Put one slice of velveeta chees in while melting the butter (I melt the butter while the noodles are draining so as to melt the butter and velveeta faster) and add 1/3 cup milk.  What you'll have is a less expensive version of the really creamy macaroni and cheese that Kraft sells for a lot more money.  By adding extra milk and cheese they're even getting more calcium.  My kids love it when I throw in hot dogs and even peas so feel free to throw in other things since it's so cheesy (the extra cheesy sauce will take things like peas that kids don't normally eat and make them taste good).  Give it a try and see what you and/or your kids think
I can't say enough good things about this variety and brand of tea.  The bergamot and other citrus elements in the tea and the delicacy of the tannins make milk, sweetener or lemon completely unnecessary.  The color and aroma are just lovely, making this a fantastic treat for the novice or experienced tea drinker, and it has just enough caffeine to get me through tedious afternoons without making me jittery.  I carry the bagged variety everywhere I go
I love this cereal. It is the greatest and looks like Amazon offers the best price. I like to add frozen wild blueberries to it with milk. YUM
We love this cereal, it is nice and crunchy and it doesn't leave you hungry for another bowl like the over processed cereals in boxes.  I definately will buy this again. 
Green is good, of course. But what's much better than green are these truly awesome cookies. PN Os beat the bootie out of any Oreo variation -- crunchier, more filling(without being smarmy), much better taste. (And this goes for the mint, the vanilla, and the chocolate.)Fast Eddie Felson -- I love you.
Now, one of the reviewers of this product complained about the sugar content of this cereal by only looking at the ingredients list, which is not how to determine the nutritional value of any product (especially when the reviewer cannot distinguish between nutritive and non-nutritive ingredients). This cereal has just as many simple sugars as Frosted Flakes, but the cereal does not claim to be low in sugar. What's important about this cereal is that it offers quite a bit of fiber and vitamins/minerals (not as much as some cereals, but since I have no deficiencies in this area, I didn't mind). Also, it only has 3 times the salt of a half cup of milk which is not LOADED. A can of healthy choice soup, now that is loaded with salt. Now, I chose this cereal as a replacement for Frosted Flakes/Honey Nut Cheerios, which against my better judgment I continued to have every morning. I should point out that I don't drink coffee in the mornings and I don't drink soda (less than 1 a week on average). I also eat no sweets.  Simple sugars (listed as just "Sugars" on the nutrition label) seem to be treated like carcinogens, while most people don't realize that aspartame (artificial sweetener in most diet sodas) really is one. If your diet is already low in sugar and you feel confident you can burn through those sugars pretty quick (since I don't drink caffeinated drinks, I need that jolt in the morning), then this is a good choice. If your diet already has quite a bit of sugar or your doctor tells you to cut down on simple sugars (or you also have a couple of cups of caffeinated coffee with sugar every morning), then go with another bran cereal without the oat clusters and syrups (which I really do not like that much). Also, if you are concerned about the total carbs, please note that a normal 2000 calories diet would include about 300g of carbohydrates (so yes, high protein diets contradict  this). Since taste is completely subjective, I won't put much emphasis on it. In my opinion, it tastes pretty good (but I don't consume many sweets during the day).
My mother absolutely loves this tea, it's the only kind she will use.  I received a container of it in a gift basket, and called bentley to find out where I could purchase more, and they told me they don't sell to the public. My mom was very upset...  I then went on to Amazon (which was great for all my christmas shopping), who put me in touch with bently, so My mother had a wonderful christmas!!!
My local Sam's Club discontinued the Nature's Path maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal due to lack of sales. I was bummed and did not want to resort to the highly processed Quaker instants - ick! Not to mention I'm tired of all the junk ingredients in mainstream food nowadays. Then I remembered Amazon selling a lot of easily shippable, bulk foods - including organics! :-)The Nature's Path oatmeal absorbs water much better and the texture is heartier than other leading brands. It is also very flavorful. The variety pack is nice, since I used to tire of the Sam's Club selection of maple and brown sugar only. My kids love steel cut oats with a little pure maple syrup, but it's not the most convenient breakfast food. The Nature's Path instant oatmeal is quick and easy during the busy weekday mornings. And best of all, I can understand the ingredients label without having to take a chemistry refresher class.I'm very satisfied with my first organic purchase from Amazon. We now peruse the selection of organic foods on Amazon before making local purchases
This is a very good value.  I use it to put in many Asian recipes instead of chicken or vegetable broth.  The result is a more authentic Asian taste to my recipes
I do not understand the bad reviews of this product. They smelled great, had a nice texture, and tasted like a dried cherry should. They did not clump at all like many dried fruits out there do. They also DID NOT taste like cardboard or were dried like NASA space food like some of the dried fruit out there does.I use these in my tea, I chop them up and toss in my vanilla ice cream, and I eat them straight out of the bag. These are the best dried cherries I have ever eaten
Twinings was founded in London, England in 1706, and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. The history of Darjeeling tea goes back to the 1840s, when Dr. Campbell, a civil engineer, planted tea seeds in his garden at Beechwood, Darjeeling. The result was a nice light tea with excellent color and aroma. Darjeeling tea gained a considerable following, and is now highly prized as the "champagne of teas!"OK, let's get down to brass tacks - this is an excellent tea, produced by a great company, and a tea I will NEVER be without. The tea has an excellent aroma and flavor and is harder to over-steep than some other teas that I have known. Also, something of a surprise is the fact that this tea tastes at least as good iced as it does hot! As such, year round you will find me making Twinings' Darjeeling tea.So, here's the bottom line: if you want a tea that is excellent hot AND cold, then Darjeeling is for you. If you want tea from a great tea producer, then Twinings is for you. If you want the best tea in the world, then buy Twinings' Darjeeling tea
Oh my good god. These are quite possibly *the* most delicious things I have ever eaten. In my life.I came across these raspberries last year at a Costco here in SoCal, and then - to my dismay - they recently stopped carrying them. I've since been searching EVERYWHERE, and I am THRILLED to finally find them here! No other brand of dried fruit can compare. Their blueberries and cherries are also excellent (and I usually don't care for either). Highly highly HIGHLY recommended!
Excellent ,Our dogs love them.We have small dogs,so the size is perfect.Little hearts for little dog
The taste is OK, but not great.  The one thing about this that is somewhat annoying is that it's a two serving packet which means that it makes 16 ounces for liquid.  I really only want to eat up 8 ounces at a time.  That means I have to guess how much is half and then roll up the bag to save the remaining portion.  Even if I did want to eat the entire packet, I don't have a bowl that is 16 ounces (and all my bowls are perfectly normal sized).  The bottom line here is that there is nothing wrong with the taste of the soup (still, I'm not in love with it).  I just wish there was a better way of packaging.  I'm the only one eating it, and maybe that affects my opinion.  If you have more than one person in your family then it won't be a problem at all, and you can ignore everything I've said.
The product, if reviewed just on taste, would only warrant a two, but the convenience is worth a five.  It is probably the best La Briute product that I have found.  It is a two minute meal that is not completely objectionable, but it is way too salty
When mini-wheats first came out in the grocery store, I tried them. However, I found they were bland. It was like trying to eat sticks in milk. Then came "frosted" mini-wheats. Okay, I decided to give it a go. Now I had sticks and sugar in milk. However, I did find out that if you forego the milk and just eat them straight from the box, like potato chips, they are excellent!Now Kellogg's has added fruity flavors to the mini-wheat. THESE I CAN EAT IN MILK! Yippee! Finally! I picked up the "Strawberry Delight" in bite size. Even though I can eat them in milk, I find that I still prefer just to eat them straight from the box, like potato chips, a type of chex-mix, or square wheat thin snack. Each serving has 140 calories. Compare that to other cereals and you'll see it is about 60 - 100 calories less. No saturated fat. No trans fat. No cholesterol. No sodium. Total fat is only 0.5g according to the box. I don't see how, since zero and zero is, well, zero. But I can live with 0.5g. Here is the bad news, the carbohydrates. There are 35g of carbs here. But that is about the same as all the other brands. Diabetics may want to pass on this due to the 10g of sugar per serving. And remember, a single serving is about the size of HALF a base ball. Not much. So if you are just pouring cereal into a "cereal bowl" without measuring, you are probably getting 2 or 3 servings in that one bowl.All-in-all, unless you are diabetic, this mini-wheat is terrific! Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews
Great substitute for high fat potato chips. Good amount of soy protein (6g per serving), excellent flavor, good crunch, and texture. These are actually pretty healthy and a great substitute for someone looking for a low fat diet. No trans or saturated fats. My wife and young daughter, who do not need a low-fat diet as I do, love these. Woohoo
I bought these lollipops for my allergic kids, because these are the only lollipops I have found that don't contain corn.  Not only do my kids love them, but so do my coworkers!  They are delicious - much more flavorful than your usual boring lollipops.  Watermelon is the office favorite so far..
My children love Smart Puffs.  I love the smaller packages for school lunches. 
Another Viva La Rice Ready to eat product that is delicious with just the right amount of flavor and great texture! I don't know how they do it but it is just right in size to take to work, camping, or to have at home
Unbelievably rich and chocolaty without sugar! No artificial sweetener aftertaste. I like that it's low fat AND high in calcium.  Plus the canister (instead of individual packets) lets you vary the portion to match the size of your mug or your strength preference.  Yummy on a cool day
Quickly became my favorite when it first came out.  Tastes great and the milk doesn't turn orange like some of the new granola type cereals.  I also use it on ice cream to add crunch.  I would give it 5 stars but even though it think it's great it is overpriced.  Price here is about the same as out local Safeway
Nutty taste, this good for you oil makes great iol based salad dressings
I've enjoyed this product for several years, and it was very convenient for me to be able to get it in the mail from Amazon. Thank you
As anyone who has tried Bahlsen Hit cookies knows, they are absolutely yummy, despite the odd packaging and name.  A nice crunchy cookie, not sickeningly sweet, good with cream and sugar tea.  funny thing about the minis though, both sides of the cookie are facing the same direction, so that one of the sides is the "wrong" way, with the printed side towards the cream....just a sidebar--no detraction from how tasty these cookies are.  
First things first, you will not be treated to that classic 'cooking' smell.    In fact, your appetite is better off not catching a whiff of that magnesium-salt concoction that heats your meal.  Think happy thoughts, and be oblivious.Why?  Because the meal itself is actually pretty good (and has an airtight separation with the 'oven').  The package also includes plastic spork, knife, and napkin.  Basically, the ingredients are on-par with what you would typically find in canned stew (and similarly need not be refrigerated).  However, the meal loses one star because the serving size is fairly small.  210 calories isn't a whole lot to go on, particularly if you must engage in strenuous physical activity under low-temperature conditions. Pros: lightweight, keeps well, cooks itself, easy disposal, tastes good.Cons: cost and storage space per calorie is somewhat high.If you were creative, you might be able to figure a way to cook something else using the box oven
Twinings was founded in London, England in 1706, and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. Irish Breakfast tea is a mixture of Ceylon and Assam (black) teas, well-known for its strong, malty taste.OK, let's get down to brass tacks - Irish Breakfast tea is not for everyone. There's an old Irish saying that says that a proper cup of tea should be "strong enough for a mouse to trot on," and this tea is certainly within striking distance of that target! But, if you add milk and sugar to this fine tea, you will be rewarded with a smooth and full-flavored drink.Irish Breakfast tea is in a class by itself among the teas I have drunk, in that it comes closest to being like coffee - that is having a strong taste that gets you up and going in the morning. Not all teas will stand up to a proper breakfast, but this one will. Overall, I have found this to be a wonderfully interesting tea, strong and robust.And that's my review. If you want a tea that will round out your hearty breakfast, then Irish Breakfast tea is for you. If you want tea from a great tea producer, them Twinings is for you. I highly recommend this hearty tea
My family and I love Almond Crunch, they're just sweet enough, very crunchy, and a perfect snack
*****Moroccan Mint is a premium Numi tea. This herbal tea is certified organic and is kosher. On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "In the Moroccan spring, the snow melts off the Atlas Mountains, watering the plains below. As the days warm, some of the most soothing, refreshing and full-flavored mint flourishes in this ancient land of the Berbers. With a flavor as light and lively as a newly picked leaf, our choice organic mint will become your favorite mint teasan. An all-day or after-dinner delight, no wonder the Moroccans drink ten cups a day."The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry.  If you are new to Numi but love mint teas, this is one that will not disappoint.  ****
My family really enjoyed this rice pudding. I loved the real cinammon stick, it gave the rice a rich flavor. The aroma in the kitchen had everyone looking forward to a real treat. Best of all is how simple it was. Boil the water, empty package, wait 20 minutes. Enjoy!
I love these nuts, I stock up on them whenever I can find them in the grocery store, now that Amazon is carrying them I can stock up whenever I go on a nut hunt.  They are sweet and crunchy and so stasifying that I can not go back to the other brand.  Actually I bought the "big" brand of nuts just recently and gave them away after trying a mouthful.  These nuts have spoiled me for any other.  These are GREAT!!
I'm a huge white tea fan and regularly keep more than five varieties at any given time.  Clipper's Organic White Tea with Peppermint is easily one of the best of any type of teas.  The flavor is balanced, well defined, and makes for smooth sippin
This product is packaged very nicely for keeping. It has good flavor without health-harming corn syrup. Used sparingly, there is very little downside to this product
What can I say about Lavazza that hasn't already been said.  I was in Rome two summer's ago and noticed it is in all the supermarkets. Decaf is usually not so great but this is. They must be doing something right
I LOVE this coffee. It has a strong flavor and aroma and gets you moving in the morning. I do not believe it is meant to be a fancy gourmet coffee, but rather what I would call Trucker or Cowboy coffee.If you like strong coffee, buy it. If you like delicate coffee, buy something else
Lapsang Souchong tea comes from the mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits. This tea has an unmistakeably smokey note, which for years made it a particular favorite with the "single malt and cigars" crowd of English clubs and drawing rooms. That aroma is created during the tea's smoking process, which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires, after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma. The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty (1644 - 1911), when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time, creating an instant sensation there. Because of its potent aroma, Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long. The rule of thumb is that the paler its color, the more likely you'll truly enjoy it
This mix is a blessing for those w/ food allergies!  Even if we didn't have any food allergies, I'd buy this mix.  I do have to cook it a bit longer than the box states and a lot longer(10m) if using a glass dish
This makes a lovely gift.  Everything is well packaged and looks expensive.  The teas are of good variety and well packaged to insure freshness.  Recommend
I like the basic Special K flakes made from rice & wheat (though I really shouldn't eat gluten).  Mostly I use cereal to snack on vs. with milk (boo lactose!).  Special K tends to have more nutritional value than most cereals which I like too.  But, I wasn't enamored with either the fruit or the yogurt parts of this particular cereal.  Frankly, I think it would taste better without them or with something else.  The yogurt pieces didn't seem to merge well with the cereal IMHO.  But then, that's why there's chocolate & vanilla
You've just located the most healthy, tasty and useful vegetarian broth manufactured today! As a long time user, I can tell you that Amazon offers the best possible price for this item.  I use it for everything:a flavoring for plain rice, as a broth for stir frying (instead of oil), as a base for complicated stews and soups.  If you find it a bit too salty, just add more water.  It has no mysterious chemical additives. It is perfect for heart patients, diabetics, vegans, and folks who just like a fast soup treat
Excellent cookies-my boys love them & know they are a treat that is on the healthy side. We will buy these again.
Our whole family loves this snack. These make a great toddler snack (they're kind of puffy, so if you don't actually chew them, they'll just melt). My 2-year old has been eating these for a year now, and is constantly asking for his "Peapods?" A portable snack, far superior nutritionally to the typical cookie, cracker, goldfish, pretzel and other processed junk most kids are eating. These are just dehydrated snap peas, corn oil and salt (and there's still LESS sodium in these than Pepperidge Farm's low-sodium goldfish!). A great alternative to the usual snack highly processed of white flour, sugar, salt and/or chemical preservatives. They're better for you, and they taste great. We love them
I think Splenda is great, but I grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is, is to let a sugar addict try it.  My husband happens to be one, and he cannot tell the difference between Splenda and sugar in his tea! As with other artificial sweeteners, you get an unpleasant after taste--with the Splenda there is none! You can use this to cook with too! It's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar. 
Green is good, of course. But what's much better than green are these truly awesome cookies. PN Os beat the bootie out of any Oreo variation -- crunchier, more filling(without being smarmy), much better taste. (And this goes for the mint, the vanilla, and the chocolate.)Fast Eddie Felson -- I love you.
This is great instant oatmeal, I eat it almost every morning. I used to buy the Quaker or store brand of the same flavor in the grocery store but I will continue to buy this. It is very convenient to order this in quantity even though I'm the only one in my household eating it, since I go through it pretty quickly
I've tried several different cranberries and these are by far the best on the market.  I received these today and had another brand available to taste test/compare.  The ingredients listed on each package were the same but Bob's has fewer calories and a much sweeter taste.  The berries do cost a little more but they are worth every penny.  The following recipe is great:1/2 cup Bob's Red Mill Extra Thick Rolled Oats (Only brand I use)1 Cup 100% Juice Apple Cider 1-2 Tablespoons dried cranberriesBrown Sugar to tasteCook Oatmeal, Apple Cider & Cranberries in microwave approximately 5 minutes.  Add brown sugar, stir & allow to sit 2-3 minutes.  Add additional cider after cooking if you like a thinner oatmeal.  If only Amazon sold Bob's Rolled Oats.....
Both adults and kids alike very much enjoyed this popcorn. Nice cheddar flavor without any yellow hands
LIke oatmeal - with good taste and texture; a little sweet (I cut it with plain oatmeal)
I really like these things.  They're certainly chewy, so they can be a bit of a jaw workout, but they taste pretty good while having a lot more nutritional value than a candy bar, and they keep you going for a couple of hours.  If only they were a little cheaper, say a dollar or less per bar, I'd probably go through them a lot more quickly than I do right now
I originally ordered a Tanita scale and it stopped working within two weeks.  (Amazon, of course, took it back with no problems.)  I was so glad when the Omron scale arrived.  It costs less than the Tanita but the quality is much higher.  The numbers on it are very large and easy to read.  Also, it is much easier to place your feet properly than on the Tanita.  I can't wait to try all the features.  By the way, I weighed myself over and over and my weight only varied .2 lbs. as promised.  Great deal for the money!!! 
my baby is 12 moth now and she uses the Pampers Cruisers (size 3) from 4-month-old. it is soft and my baby never have "rush" with it.  my whole family love this diapers.
I have had so much fun learning Bio feedback and learnig to breath.  The exercises and the story line are really helpful to achive control and develope skills for meditation.  I highly recommned this product.  I will be purchasing the add-on in the near future
They don't seem small at all.  I would agree that it's like a size 3, if you're talking about toddler CLOTHING, but the diaper size is different.  My daughter wears 3T clothes, size 5 Easy Ups
This is the best tasting energy bar I have ever had. My kids love them too. Great high energy snack
I'm writing to correct a few factual errors in other reviews.  One reviewer claimed that Soldier Fuel contains no energy ingredients.  This is untrue.  Soldier Fuel was formulated by military labs specifically to provide steady energy to troops.  Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy.  Soldier Fuel contains 29 g of complex carbs (the carbs that give long-lasting energy) and 12 g of sugar.  The U.S. Military labs deemed this the perfect ratio to give you both a quick burst of energy and no crash.  Most other energy drinks on the market have lots of sugar and caffeine.  Since caffeine is a stimulant and not a source of energy, the result is a quick spike in energy followed by a crash.   Another error is that Soldier Fuel has more sugar.  It has less.  One 12 oz. can of Soldier Fuel has 12 g of sugar.  The same amount of Gatorade contains 21 g of sugar.  The same amount of Red Bull has 39g sugar.Finally, the support for the troops is not marketing hype.  Our company is partnered with the U.S. Military's Natick Soldier Center.  A portion of the gross proceeds from each can of HOOAH! Soldier Fuel and each HOOAH! bar directly funds research that improves the safety, diet, and quality of life of our troops
This is a fantastic tool for self improvement and relaxation and a flawed but acceptable game by gaming standards alone.  The biofeedback hardware/software is excellent and you WILL make progress whether your goals are stress reduction, better meditation, building higher self-esteem, maybe even reaching higher states of consciousness etc...The "biofeedback events" are diverse and well designed and generally just great to use!  Most of the in-game advice is also fantastic and there are a few "easter eggs" which offer very practical tools to help build your self esteem, realize your goals etc...Much of the *substance* of this project is masterfully achieved (though there are a few cheesy moments).That said the interface etc. needs help, it can be downright frustrating, and the relatively low-res graphics can be a strain on some screens.  Thankfully these issues have been addressed in the expansion pack Wisdom Quest, which I also highly recommend.  Overall, this is a really innovative and great product.  Also a good investment as far as biofeedback devices go since there will likely be more expansion packs and third-party software to come
My daughter Morgane, who is now 8 years old, has been suffering from delibitating migraines since infancy (yes, there is such a thing, unfortunately).The symptoms are very impressive, she usually drops to the floor and starts vomiting within a few minutes. She cannot move or open her eyes. It makes her very anxious and we noticed that she hyperventilates when she thinks she is going to "get dizzy". We tried to make her breathe slowly and calm down, to no avail. Morgane's doctor told us that breathing slowly and practicing biofeedback were the best non-drug practices against migraines, and we try to avoid giving Morgane medication as she is so young. So I thought of using RESPeRATE as my Dad has high-blood pressure and I knew it worked on the breathing pattern.Morgane immediately understood how to use the device, it was so easy and even fun for her. It relaxes her and gives her the strength to know she can do something about her migraines. Her breathing pattern has reduced considerably and so far, she has not had another migraine attack for about 6 months. She used to have them every two months.I have purchased another device for my best friend, a long time migraine sufferer. The way I see it, it is such a painful condition that anything that helps without harm is a blessing
This is a great product, easy to program and use.. easy to read digital display and very accurate
My physician introduced me to this item. He said very accurate when compaired to the water and pinching methods. Is affordable and easy to use. Oh, did I forget to mention, accurate compaired to a scale model I own. Amazon is great to order from, the online ordering was easy and the product arrived in 5 days!
I received this parfum as a birthday gift and I fell in love with it as soon as I smelled it.  The scent lasts all day without being too overbearing. I swear every single time I wear this, someone stops me and asks what am I wearing.  The fragrance is crisp and sensual.  It kind of reminds me of Bath & Body Works' Moonlight Path. Buy it, you won't regret it, especially for the price that Amazon is offering it for
I am so happy with this product. I have chronic stomach trouble and this enzyme product has saved me from many days and nights of upset stomach. If I eat too late at night or eat the "wrong" thing, I just pop a couple capsules and no problems for the night
I like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model.  The kids find the 30 second interval timer especially helpful to keep moving around the mouth.  It's a bit louder than the older model, probably because it's got an additional motion, and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light.Overall, just what we wanted
I am totally satisfied with thids product so far. Of course if the batteries run out of charge after a few charges I will be dissatisfied. I expect them to last tens of reusses if experience can be of any guideline
I have been using this attachment to my waterpik for gum disease for five years----it directs the medicine into the gum pockets easily and helps save me from really big bills at the periodontist.  It works for me, but needs to be used in conjunction with regular flossing, brushing, and generally good tooth care. 
I rate this piece of equipment as 4 stars because I have not used it enough to know if it does everything it claims....however I have been amazed at how this little contraption does wonders on my back. When I first got this lumbar extender I set up up in about 2 seconds and then stretched backwards to lay on it. OMG, as I laid down it was like I couldn't even breath for a brief second. To actually feel my back being forced into shape nearly took my breath away as all the muscles were pushed around. I had to relax and it was amazing how sore the muscles in my back were from leaning over my computer at work. Having used it for about a month now, my back has started to feel much better and I am sleeping better too
This stuff is AWESOME for hangovers. It was like my high school staple! I mean, I went through like a box a week. At least give it a try
Shaving cream in a tube is just about impossible to buy at retail outlets. This is a great product and I will continue to buy it through Amazon
That's the only way I can rate this product. If it taste great, then it gets a high rating from me
These are great for those days you just want to sit in the sun and read without sun glare. Great product
Great and accurate.  It is a pleasure to use.Best monitor available
Easy to use. Short time to recharge the baterie. Long life batery and it is appropriate o sensitive skin
I purchased this for use in my bathtub.  It is more comfortable than the blow-up ones and stays cleaner. 
 I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE LIGHT OUTPUT.  I PURCHASED THEM TO LIGHT THE INSIDE OF MY CHILDS PLAYHOUSE.  THEY REALLY ILUMINATE THE INSIDE AS BRIGHT AS A STANDARD LIGHT BULB.  I PURCHASED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AN EARLIER TYPE LANTURN BY RAYOVAC AND WAS REALLY PLEASED WITH IT ALSO.
I Luv this Burberry. Pple always comment anytime I wear it. My girlfriend almost made me stop wearing it cos she said anytime I wear it she feels like doing things I can't mention here 2 me, and since she feels tht way, other women will certainly feel like tht.I'm getting another one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Also fast and proper services by amazon
Yes, I did feel a difference.  Benadryl is not effective for me so I was sceptical. I am glad I found this . I use for when I need to sleep in an unfamiliar place
The product does what it says it cuts your hair and contains it all in a vacuum container
I've had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best.  Strong motor, easy adjust, strong vacuum.  Other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is kinda suprising to me.  One wouldn't want to push down hard against the face when trimming a beard.... the idea is to glide the unit over your beard... you're not raking, you're trimming!Also the unit is easy to clean out after use.  The waste receptacle snaps out easily, as does the cutter head in order to shake out or brush out debris
It is really great!!!  Sure, it does hurt, but not any more than waxing.  I do not shave because I get cut very easily.  This is a great alternative to expensive waxing.  Even when I have more hair it works.  I would buy this product again, and again
I never thought the world would get here.  I am actually spending time to type up a review, online, for shaving lotion.Well, here you go:  for every man out there who is interested and who has ever used an electric shaver, if you haven't tried the Norelco Cool Skin electric shaver with this lotion, you have to.  Whoever has sensitive skin, you need to switch to this, because it does a great job.  That's all I have to say and I won't waste anymore time
This is the BEST !!! Drys you off fast,and drys fast too.. So soft and comfy on my skin!!
I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  Well made with good trim length settings, it's also easy to hold.  Recommended
Having previously owned battery powered travel razors, I was always disappointed with their power and battery life. After all, what's the point ditching a heavier charger and razor if you have to carry a load of extra batteries and still end up stubbly faced? The Braun 370-BK was a pleasant surprise, however; powerful enough to hack through my hiking stubble and plenty of juice for an extended outing. I also liked the folding design which protects the cutting surfaces and keeps the cleaning brush from getting lost. A great piece of tech at a good price
They are a nice compact size for travel. They work as advertised, just expect to let them heat up longer than the stated "quick curl" time
For me a good  tweezer is well worth paying for and this is a very good tweezer. I had the same one, this brand, for six years and then dropped it and it went out of alignment. I immediately ordered my new tweezer. If not dropped I suspect this would last a lifetime
The stuff can seem somewhat pricy (specially on a college budget) but it's well worth it. The taste isn't much to talk about; you're better of just holding your nose and chugging it at once. Then again, weightlifters don't eat supplements for taste do they? I have a huge energy problem, I lack it a lot. Between class and work, I'm usually drained at the end of the day, but this stuff helps me get into the gym and hit it hard. This isn't to say that it won't requre motivation on your part, but it sure helps. During the workout, you may notice an increase in your pump. My muscles felt so tight and big, that I just wanted to lift more and more. By the time I was done, I went to the lockeroom to change and saw a monster in the mirror. I've had great pumps before, but this was insane! It didn't even look like me at all; it felt great. I've been using it for 2 months now and I don't train a day without it. Highly, highly recommended
I've tried many types of nutrition bars and many are too sweet or they are not tasty. Clif bars get it right
The first epilator that I used was The Epi-lady with coils that came out in the 80's.  I did not use this for long....A tool of complete TORTURE!I finally got brave enough to give epilators a try again and got one from "VEET" which has a single roller of tweezers but it did such a good job that I was completely hooked on using an epilator. Good-bye razors and wax!I figured that if a single roller did a good job that the Conair which had two rollers would do even better. The Conair does a good job and I'm keeping it as my spare,  but the epilator from Veet actually does a better job.  I no longer have any discomfort from the epilators and I even do my bikini area and underarms.I love the results on my underarms and the money saved on waxing.Once you see and feel the results you will be completely won over.UPDATE:  I've had more time to use the Conair Epilator and now I've actually been using it more than my "Veet".Just give yourself time to adjust to this epilator and you will be very happy with it.As a matter of fact I am ordering one as a gift for one of my friends
I purchased 5 of these for myself and coworkers. We are all on our feet all day long. After one other coworker told us about the one he had, we all had to have one to help our tired feet. Everyone of us is very happy with this product. It is a great value for the price. There are other messagers that are more expensive but these are just super. We did have a problem with one, but Amazon quickly exchanged it for us. I think it was defective from the factory. Great product and even better service from Amazon
This razor is the best I have ever shaved with. It copes with every length of hair and angle of growth whether I shave every day, every other day, or even every third day. Perfect
I purchased the mitts for a gift and also for myself. The person for whom I purchased them is very happy with them and so am I. I was looking for a mitt that could keep my hands as hot as possible because I have arthritis and was surprised that the heat stays for more than 1 hour. It is too soon to tell but I hope it will help me with the arthritis in my hands. 
This razor is fantastic. The gel pieces are very soft and keep even my dry skin from being too bad!! The only problem I had with it was the gel parts don't last quite as long as a bottle of shaving cream/gel would. But if you are looking for a quick, handy and yet still good shave, this is exactly what you are looking for
Now my husband can't "borrow" my gasses and I NEVER loose them.  I have one of each color and get rave comments every time I take them off in front of strangers.
This is the best shaver I have found during 25 to 30 years of electric shaving
This heating pad wraps around, stays put, does a perfect job and turns off by itself. Spend the money and get a better mousetrap
Used to have a lot of liquid soap and shampoo get washed down the drain by my two kids... kids will be kids... but now they really like having their own dispenser buttons to push. Easy to mount and easy to use
This product gives your hair great volume without looking greasy.(Be careful not to use too much!) It works best if you have a little time to diffuse your hair with a blow dryer! Not surprisingly, when I use curl conscious many people will compliment the curls and the depth it adds to my hair :)I wish it would combat frizz a little more, but my hair is less frizzy when I use it. I guess the next thing I'll try is the Bumble and Bumble Frizz Fighter
I have medium colored hair, and I've used this trimmer many times.  It shaves away the hair just fine for me, you know need to know how to get to all the hair.  If your hair is so coarse that this trimmer doesn't work, you I'd recommend waxing!  Fast, effective, good angling
We all have very pale skin in my family, and these are great little "I forgot to put on sunscreen" helpers!  I keep one in the car, one in my purse, etc., so we are never without one.  Excellent product, and easy to use
This is the best reacher I have ever used.  I am in a wheelchair due to MS and have used various types over the past 6 years but the quality and ease of use is much better with this.  
I took "My" unit to a monthly meeting for seniors.  Their machine broke & I took mine as a replacement.  They liked it so well, they had me buy this unit for the monthly meetings.  They like all the different aspects of the machine.  A suggestions could be to include a card that you could carry in your wallet & write down the date & the numbers from the machine? 
This is the best affordable acne solution that ive ever used. I had acne on my forehead and the acne started to get smaller and even the acne on my cheeks just disappeared the next morning. On the box there is a sticker that said that it works faster than proactiv solution and its right! Proactiv takes like 2 weeks to work but this works over night. The only minor thing about it is when you put on the overnight acne control lotion, it starts feeling like its harding into a mask on your face. It feels like its restricing muscle movement on your face. Its no biggy because it works and it washes right off in the morning when im in the shower. I cant believe a little lotion can make such a difference. If you are looking for acne solution at a affordable price then this is exacly what you are looking for
THESE BATTERIES ARE USED NON-STOP, ONE SET IN AND ONE ON THE CHARGER. NO PROBLEMS WOULD BUY AGAIN !
I've used hot air brushes for a couple years.  This works better than my last.  The low setting and the larger brush works better for me.  The high setting blows the hair off the bristles.  It's nice having the small brush option for different styles though.  I believe my hair stays styled longer and without as much work and injuries using a hot air brush versus a curling iron
My husband bought three pairs of these glasses, and they are the only pair that he hasn't lost yet.  He absolutely loves them.  Just keep them around his neck all day and clips them together for quick use.  I think they look funny; but who cares- they are convenient and a great product
I've had other razors and believe me, this one is the most reliable on I've had! It works well, does NOT hurt? (maybe the people who had one that pinches or hurts them got a bad one?) A feature I like and use often is the head pops up to cut longer hair...unfortunately at times I need this before I use the regular cutter. Battery life is acceptable, power is good, and just a few swipes is all you need. You really can't compare a blade razor to an electric- they are not yet comparable for cutting or time used. This razor, however, has a better level of shaving than other electrics, closer to a blade than the others. In convenience an electric is much better than any blade- you can use it anywhere, dry, just sittin' around
I appreciate the gentle, yet powerful cleaning of All Free Clear Allergen Detergent.  I have an infant & find this cleans her clothes & ours well without leaving any harsh irritants, so it's easier to do the family's laundry all together
This has helped my wife and I to lower our cholesterol.  I take it in conjunction with Red Yeast Rice Extract(this must be taken at night) because my numbers are very high.  My wife's numbers are right on borderline.  We took blood tests before and after using it and have seen great improvements.  My numbers went down 37 points in a few months and my wife's numbers went down about half of mine.  (I also take double the dose she does.)  It's a great way to keep healthy, naturally.  My father-in-law started using it and has seen improvements, also.  His dangerous PSA numbers (prostrate) even dropped radically.  We don't know if that was due to the fish oil-but he believes it was.  His dr. said he'd never seen numbers drop that much.  We tell just about everyone we know about it. 
First of all, let me say this product is great in almost every way. So if you need to feel better about your nose and/or throat, go for it.My main complain about the Grossan Hydro Pulse is that it is noticeably expensive. Some time ago, Grossan was making just his own irrigator tip matching it to a Waterpik machine that cost a half the price of the Hydro Pulse. But then, Grossan decided to produce his own machine and, if I'm right, Viajet is making it for him. Viajet sells the same machine, except for the Grossan tip, at about -again- a half the price of the Hydro Pulse.  The Breathe-ease solution that you might use along with the irrigator is also expensive (I have check this comparing it with a simillar product that can be purchased in my country).So what makes the Hydro Pulse so expensive? Maybe health is a business, after all.Other than that, like I have said, this product is great for almost any respiratory problem. I used to irrigate my nose with a similar solution that comes in a 135 ml bottle, and is intended to use it over 50 times. The Hydro Pulse lets you do a 500 ml clean everytime, so you get the idea.Also, if you are suffering respiratory problems and want to chek an interesting drug-free treatment, look for the Buteyko Method
Alka-Seltzer got it right and in a big way. Drink this and 20 minutes later your headache is gone and your stomach is settled so you can motor down to the local taco stand for some much needed nourishment. I prefer the regular flavor as opposed to the citrus.
I used the Huggies Overnite diapers on my son at night until we started potty training.  I used to put absorbent inserts inside his pull-ups to get him through the night without leaks, but even that didn't work very well.  Finally, Huggies came out with an overnight pull-up - and it really works well!!!  Excellent product
This is a fine, well lasting bar of soup that smells like sweet oranges--you will catch wiffs of the very pleasant fragrance every time you enter the bathroom.  It reminds me of tangerine lifesavers, if that helps.It's a big bar, too, the dimensions of the bar are, in inches:  4 x 2.5 and 1.5 thick
I bought this toothbrush a month ago, and have been very satistfied with it. The battery lasts about a month and the brush leaves me with a clean feeling that you can't get from a manual toothbrush. The price is good, the battery life is good, and the battery door is very easy to open! I would buy it again!
I've owned two Thermaphore heating pads, different sizes, for many years and I'm using one right now! They're quality made to last a lifetime. They trap moisture from the air so no need for soaking sponges to insert. The trigger switch allows you to heat as needed as hot as you like and if you fall asleep there are no worries of burns..if the trigger isn't depressed it isn't heating. I wouldn't be without mine. It helps me manage my arthritis/fibromylagia/nerve damage pain. I've recommended it to many of my friends who have been very pleased as well.  
The filter is small compared with most other systems; has a sturdy, metal fixture and pull-knob activator; filters quickly with plenty pressure; and of course it has the great Culligan taste
It usually takes forever for me to dry my hair, but it dried really fast and STRAIGHT!  I can go a few extra weeks without a relaxer!  And the color is beautiful... I just love orange :O
This is one of the nicest electric shavers that I've owned and the first wet-type shaver. I have previously owned Norelcos for over a decade. The original Norelcos (made in Holland) were fine but the recent ones have pathetic quality and they literally pull hair! It is painful! I eventually gave up trying to use my replacement lift-and-cut Norelco and decided to try out a high end model that cost close to two hundred dollars. Bad idea - you don't always get what you pay for! I was not quite happy with that either and after a two year haitus with disposable Gillettes, decided to try a wet shaver. I took my chance on this one, based solely on the reviews here. This is the very first "wet" shaver I've used and absolutely love it. It gives a close enough shave but not too close. You can use it with whatever shaving cream you use. Note that the Panasonic manual encourages using the cheapest foam type (not gel), Barbasol like stuff with this shaver. It also comes with a basic carrying pouch and the cleaning is as easy as it can get (just wash the thing under tap water). They really meant that this unit is washable. It is recharagable, lasts seven days on a charge, and costs less than replacement blades for competing brands. The build quality is excellent. The charger is a very clever design that gets the shaver completely off your counter space. You cannot go wrong with this. Amazon has a great value here. Sometimes you get more than you asked for and this is one of those rare things. Highly recommended. 
There are a lot of positive comments about this mirror and some very negative comments.  I weighed both before I made my decision and chose to give more weight to the positive comments.  I am glad I did.  The light from the mirror is bright, the slide bar for the different light settings works very well.  If you hold the switch to the count of 2 or 3 and then release the lights work every time.  I enjoy the mirror very much and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their use.The only negative I have about the mirror is that the flourescent tubes buzz a little but I am getting accustomed and learning to tune them out.  
this thing is really cool and works very easily.  Once you performthe 10 minute setup and enter your info (once), you just step onit and tell it what setup number your are and it takes and saves the measurement.  It seems very steady and well built and I think it should last a long time
I love the smell of an essential oil in the air. I've tried tealight burners, a smear on a low-burning lamp, and a miniature crockpot designed for aromatherapy. The PearlEssence Spa Mist is absolutely the best ever for diffusing an odor and continuing to diffuse it for an extended period of time. Because I live in a humid climate, I was concerned that misting would only add to mold problems and perhaps mar wooden furniture. The cool mist instantly absorbs even into our air. The light show of the base can be turned off, but I like it most of the time. Product was offered for $10 less than at a well-known local natural market chain, and shipping was free with my order over $25 with other products.
The LifeSource BP Monitor was just what I wanted and was priced just right.  It was delivered in a timely manner and I am a happy camper along with my wife. Thanks.
This product was reffered to me by my hairstylist after she noticed alot of frizziness and breakage in my hair. This has worked beautifully to protect my hair from the blowdryer and straightening iron! I would give this product 10 stars if it were available! My hair is very smooth and very healthy looking because of this product and other products by Chi.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone
I just bought this iron and I couldn't be happier. It's the perfect size and weight. The plates aren't unmanageably large, or pitifully small... It heats up incredibly fast-- we're talking in less than 60 seconds. I have short-ish, wavy and coarse hair- it's straight and silky smooth within 5 minutes. HAI is a brand used in many salons and it's all for a reason- they make fantastic flat irons. If you bought this same iron at a salon, you could easily pay upwards of $150 in Canada... so I consider this price an awesome deal
Shaving gives me all sorts of problems, I must have super sensitive skin or something. I cannot afford laser and wax just isn't my thing. Grabbed this for myself before Christmas on a whim. It was money well spent!After 3 months of use, I have gotten the hang of the product. I suggest you practise then shave regularly for a month or more. Say, run the product over each leg once till you get used to it. Then trying to completely remove the hair. My legs are unbelievably soft. No rash, one little tender area after I spent too much time there. Do keep moving and keep a razor in the cabinet just in case. I still have trouble around my ankles.Hair regrowth is markedly thinner since I began using it. By about half. What remains still grows long but I'm, err, what does one call this process? - doing it once a week and only takes a few minutes
I got this for my husband and he states that the trimmer is great but it needs to have a smaller base. The charger part of the trimmer is just too big. Even though it is big for size it does not hold all the attachments. He would recommend the trimmer to do the job it is intended for
We originally got this to replace the "fan noise" in the winter due to our sons' room being so cold.  The first couple days the sound seemed so loud but you quickly get used to it.  We've discovered it's very helpful for blocking out the noise of other children running through the house while our newborn is sleeping in addition to the city noises at night.  With the adjustability dials it's ideal for a nursery or bedroom for those who cannot sleep without a fan.  It doesn't however, cover the sound of someone coughing or snoring loudly.  Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sound machine for environmental noise, especially for children
I've been using this for the last 3 months and I'm a very satisfied customer. I get a very close shave, and no razor bumpors. I'm Afircan American and my beard is coarse and curly, sometimes with many razor this can lead to ingrown   hair problems. I highly recommend this, because it's a much close shave than the typical elctric razors by brands such as Braun and Norelic. It's very cheap and the only maintainence is clipper oil. I cam across these because the only time I would get a great shave was at the barber. When he used clippers on me I've never had any problems with ingrown hair, therefore I decided to own my own pair of clippers. I'm very pleased with with product and highly recommended as a very effective and affordable method for shaving and trimming
I bought this for my husband.  He had a plantars wart on the bottom of his foot that was removed but became a callus that gave him pain.  Emu oil is the first thing that softened it and it is better than it has ever been and he had suffered with it for years
this is the best bargain for your money.pampers swaddlers are better than pampers. even better than costco brand. worth every penny
I was suffering from intense neck and shoulder pain before I started using this pillow.  When I started sleeping on it a couple of months ago, the pain was gone after the first night, and it hasn't come back since then.  It supports my neck perfectly.  I highly recommend
I've had this trimmer for 10 years and never had a problem.  Sometimes the switch needs to be moved twice but it always works.  Never falls apart and cut hair great.  I'd buy another if this one would ever wear out! 
the pills really do work.  I stopped taking stacker over a year ago and i stopped my routine workouts and i gained 40 lbs in just one year!  I was so frustrated and dissapointed at myself so i started going to the gym but i was finding it hard to motivate myself to do anything while at the gym.  I just started taking stacker3 for one week and already i have dropped almost 10 lbs (of course with excersise as well)  This pill not only helps with energy but as i have read, it also works as a metabolism enhancing property! Thank you NVE for a great product.  THe only negative thing about it is that i sometimes feel dizzy and a numbness to my fingers.  (that was the reason i stopped taking it in the first place but its really not life threatening or as serious as it may sound)
My husband was totally delighted with the Rollator Walker.  It is so much easier to use than the typical walker that we had to wonder why anyone wouldn't want this new, much more attractive kind.  It folds up very easily when not in use and the basket comes in very handy for carrying things.  When folded up it fits in the back seat of our car, and it would probably fit in the trunk if your truck is fairly large.  We put it together in about 5 minutes and the price was great, what more can you ask
I love the taste of these little Chocolates. I find that I need to have one 1 hour before eating - less and they don't work. If I have  two in one day (late morning, mid-afternoon) the effect is cumalative. I can eat a very light dinner and be completely satisfied
I'm not sure how well since I have never used anything like this before, but my bath water feel a whole lot better and I do not itch for an hour afterwards. I probably should have rated a 5 star, but I really have no base for comparing. I will definitely buy this product again.
   Yo nunca habia usado una afeitadora electrica y al comprar esta hice una excelente inversion porque me deja la piel practicamente lisa, muy suave y lo mejor de todo no tengo que usar agua. Le dura la bateria y se limpia muy facilmente con el cepillito que trae. Si compras el polvo de remington que ellos recomiendan es mucho mejor porque la afeitadora se desliza con mas suavidad. Saludos Rafael desde Cabimas Venezuel
I love this product. It just tastes great especially with milk.
I have several of these glasses now.  Love them. They are strong and adjustable and so much better then wearing the granny cord around your neck.  I wish there was a berrer looking sunglass besides that goggle looking one.  Good price and good product.
I love this soap, it's a little big and hard to hold during shower, but the smell totally makes up for it!  it has a very strong (but good) grapefruit smell, it's very fresh and rinses completely off
Tastes great, and it's good for a normal weight training person like me
 Kama Sutra Massage Oil in the 8oz bottle is really good stuff!Keeps the skin so smooth and the girlfriend happy LoL just make sure you warm it up alittle before squirting it on. You will live longer
Back in the early 90s I was going through a bad acne period.  I finally visited a dermatologist, and he put me on an Accutane regimen.  I had sensitive skin and a tough beard, so regular shaving cream was too harsh (especially while taking Accutane - the solid brush-on cream I was using at the time burned the edges of my lips).  He recommended that I shave with Cetaphil.  Years later, my skin and beard are still troublesome.  Therefore, I've kept Cetaphil as a part of my shaving regimen.Cetaphil goes on well and provides a nice lubrication for my shaver.  It's not harsh or irritating, even on a freshly shaved face.  However, it's kind of cold in the morning, which is a bit counter-productive after heating my face with hot water and shower steam to soften the whiskers.  So I put the bottle on the tub floor while showering to heat it up with the runoff.  By the time I'm done, it's warm enough for application after rubbing some around my hands for a second or two.  However, even though Cetaphil feels good and lubricates well, its consistency is a bit thin to use alone.  I like a good lather, so I combine Cetaphil with Kiss My Face Moisture Shave, which was recommended to me by a woman working at GNC.  They mix well together, and I get a good, non-irritating shave by using the Gillette Fusion Power razor.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I apply a product that contains salicylic acid, such as Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.If you have a razor-challenging beard and skin combination like me, then make Cetaphil part of your shaving routine.  Recommended
I got this for my husband because he had to shave too frequently and I thought they'd improve upon the Mach3.  Well they did!  This Turbo brand of Mach 3 is actually much better; his shave lasts longer, the blades last longer, and it leaves a very attractive smooth shave.  I choose this one over that Mach3 power vibrating blade because, I don't know, a sharp blade the vibrates is asking for trouble in my opinion.  Haha...  He's very happy with it and likes the shave.  And speaking about money, if the shave and blades last longer than before, it's a great value!Highly suggested!!
I cannot say how well this product really compares to other sunscreens in terms of sun protection. But it does have the right ingredients that most top-rated sunscreens/sunblocks use, so it should be at least on par with them.Where this product really shines (or DOESN'T shine) is for people with combination/oily skin. I have tried MANY sunscreens, and it's so hard to find a sunscreen WITHOUT moisturizers (if you have oily skin, that's already your natural moisturizers).I have even tried other NEUTROGENA sunscreens that are supposed to be OIL FREE and all that. The result on my face? After applying it, I always SHINE (which is NOT what I want).This magnificent product, however, actually gives my face a nice MATTE finish... and matte FEEL, too! It's a pretty thick cream when you first apply it (as opposed to other suncreens or other products that feel more like LOTION), but is almost immediately absorbed by the skin. In 30 seconds, there is no more greasy/creamy feeling, and in one minute, if you feel your skin, there's a nice matte feel.HOWEVER, and this is not the fault of the product, after about 3 hours (at least for me), then I feel like the matte effect has worn off, and my oily skin is again showing its oily nature.Still, as far as suncreens go, this is the best I have tried for my skin, and I highly recommend it for people with combination/oily skin.BTW, this review is for the actual product I got, which is SPF 30. As of the time I am writing this review, here in amazon they also offer an SPF 45 version, and cheaper, too! I don't know the difference, but I always go for the LOWER one (in this case, SPF 30), because I theorize -- rightly or wrongly, I don't know -- that the lesser the SPF, the lesser the strength of the ingredients, so maybe it's better for sensitive skin (?)
Great for people with sensitive skin or prone to acne.  I began using neutrogena as a teenager 25 years ago.  It helped clear up teen acne & has kept my skin free of razor burn in more recent years
When I get a sinus infection, it stays and builds much congestion. Rx and over-the-counter has limited value. One event that led to my first (I am 69) severe asthma event, which messed up my immune system and led to my first angina events which the brought open heart surgury.NeilMed pre-mixed packets sound like the "minor leagues" compared to the above. When a thorough cleansing is needed to make the sinus areas hostile to infection, these little packets take the mess out of measuring your own salt and soda(i.e. to make a mistake is painful even with the right salt).Then there is a $15 price in local stores for 100 packets, or about the same on-line for 200. Also a quick response from the vendor.  
This is a good massager that can hone in on the pressure points. The knob is a little large for getting at specific reflex spots, but generally does the job
maybe because I ordered a "medium".  It works fine otherwise.  I recommend it
Hydrabrush is an excellent power toothbrush because the brushHead has more surfaces to get at your teeth and gum line making the brushing very comfortable and refreshing afterwards. I use the soft brushHead because I used to have gingivitis and my gums were red and swollen, but since using the Hydrabrush and the 8 brushes (4 on each side) I don't have to worry about missing when I brush my teeth. Excellent product.
Comes in nice display box with cushioned spaces.  A quality time piece.  Band has a felt backing for extra comfort.  The smaller items are buttons that are afixed with tie tack type closures.
The earrings were very cute and the screw backs were definitely a good find. My daughter loved them so much she actually had them almost a whole month before she lost one.  But that is no bash on the earrings, the fact that she did not lose them the first week is a major accomplishment.I would definitely buy them again.
Quality of leather looks nice.  I can see what the other writer meant about the clasp coming off.  It's metal squeazed to leather and that's what I expected.  You just have to keep an eye on it and don't sleep or shower in it.  It looks nice
It is good and nice design. But it is little bit heavy.
Gave these to my wife as part of a birthday gidt and she loves them. She says they feel more comfortable than most "stud"-type and they look great
I needed something to express how I felt in a way that few words would say exactly that and the yin yang necklace did it for me. 
I'm quite happy with these and writing to say so, because other users' comments were very helpful to me--especially the person who said that the earrings were substantial: i.e., though diminutive, they have bulk so are visible, with nice warm glow
This is a very grown up looking watch and my son who is seven, loved it, but it bothered him that it didn't fit very well. The velcro part didn't go very far so it was too big and we ended up putting this one away for maybe next year and buying another timex that was easier to adjust, which worked pretty well by the way.
Works like advertised. Syncs well with atomic time from Colorado (I am in California). Looks nice.
Great looking watch... looks just like the photo if not better. Very pleased with the quality and for a very affordable price
These watches are just as cute as they look in the ad. This is 1 of 3 I bought for Christmas. All 3 girls really like them. No one has had any trouble with them
Very lovely for a good price and came less then a week after I ordered it with standard mail.  Was very impresse
I bought this for almost 50% less than it sells in the local department store and am happy with my purchase.   The only trouble I have had is with the clasp.  It is a little tricky and you have to make sure that is catches correctly.  I found my watch on the floor recently because the clasp came open
apart of great look and seem durability, it is strange feature in such kind of dial. You have chronograph, but you do not have idea where it stops. 23 or 26 seconds? Difficult to find out with such a dial..
The Casio G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch #GW1400DA-4AV is sort of middle of the road in terms of price (I paid $99). It's not cheap but it's not too expensive either. The display diameter is not large but it is a thick, tough-looking watch (a real man's watch... :) ). It's also on the heavy side. So, if you're looking for an elegant, thin watch, look somewhere else.When I first got it, the power source was at 50% charge. After leaving the watch on my desk facing up towards a desk fluorescent lamp that was left on, the charge reached 100% the next day. The solar cell seems to be working. The time is accurate too. I checked it against the computer time (which also gets synched everyday). It comes with a small manual (with very small text), but I found that there's really no need to use the manual at all initially. It works right out of the box and all the factory settings were correct. (The manual will come in useful when you have some time on your hands to browse through it to get a clearer idea of all the available features.)The watch's steel wristband was much too large for me and I had to shorten it (removed 4 links, actually). I used a Swiss army knife blade to accomplish the task. The knife tip has to be strong enough to apply pressure to the spring loaded rod that holds the links together, but small to get into the small area between the wrist band metal links (watch for the arrows: these tell you where to apply the pressure). You need to push down on the ridges of the rod, and out (away from you). (Down, so that you can make the rod shorter, and out so that when the rod is shortened, the wrist band link will pop out). I did accidentally scratch the band but it wasn't too bad since the scratch was on the inside. (It's easy enough to shorten the wristband and almost everyone who gets this watch will have to do this.) Be careful not to slice your finger open. Always turn the blade away from your finger when applying the pressure.Overall, I give it 2 thumbs up for looks and functionality.(Note: this watch is sold by multiple vendors on Amazon. You should check for the one that has the best price. When I bought it, I wasn't aware of this but found out later, a little too late)
I've seen very inconsistant reviews for Silver Insanity items.  I received this necklace for Christmas last year, and it's pretty nice.  Generally I always receive a compliment when I wear it.  For the price, it's worth it. If you're looking for something nicer, you're simply going to have to pay more
The watch was even more attractive than it appeared. I had none of the noise problems that were described in other reviews. The mesh bracelet is not as comfortable as the leather bands I am used to. In low light it is sometimes difficult to see (my eyesight is good). But basically I am very satisfied
I like this Watch it's good price and also cool look ;)hey guys you will not lose anythings if you have one like it :
All right so these earrings are absolutely adorable! They are fun and go with anything! Good size. Good quality. I would buy for someone as a gift
I used this necklace as a matching piece to my fiance's marquise heavy engagment ring. It is a beautiful contemporary piece of jewelry. It's symmetry and simplicity are hard to find in sea of gawdy overly embellished jewelry pieces. It's a great buy and my fiance loves it
I just bought this pin to put in my hair for my upcoming wedding, I love it!  It's really sparkly and gorgeous.  I also accidentally dropped it on tile flooring and it didn't break.  Very nice pin
Nice bracelet for the price. Good for gifts for friends (which is what I purchased them for) Everyone was very happy with them
Lovely jewelry, great price, but the clasp is pretty tough to work. This is not the necklace for anyone with stiff fingers. I'm also worried that the clasp might not hold up to repeated use and wish it was the more traditional link to link closure than this insert-key type clasp. It's probably a great choice for very occassional use, though with the quality and price, it really is a regular-use type of necklace. I think it's best suited for the nimble-fingered, traditional-fashion person
they are beautiful and delicate. i just love the way they sparkle. thanks, amazon
I bought this for my sister for Christmas.  I have a similar one that is bigger, that I bought while in Charleston, SC.  She fell in love with mine, and since driving 4 hours just to buy a necklace was out of the question, I decided on this one.  At first, when it arrived, I thought it would be too small, but my sister does not wear large neclaces, earrings, etc... Turns out she loved it.  It was just perfect for her, especially since her neck is thin and her complexion is olive
I have owned this watch for almost 4 years now with absolutely no complaints.  After going through several cheaper watches to wear at work and on a casual basis I decided to spend a few extra bucks to see if I could get more wear out of one and I am sold on this one.  I work in a facility that deals with chemicals that are hard on watches and I also work with mechanical equipment that is hard on crystals and this watch has held up in my working environment quite well. Because I am not a diver, I am not sure that this is a good diving watch but I do fish and play in the Atlantic and this watch has held up through use in the sand and salt with very little care given to it.  I am still on my first band and battery and the watch still keeps accurate time.  The band is starting to crack a bit but, after what I've put this watch through, I am surprised it has held up this long.  The crystal is a tad bit scratched but the other watches that I have had would have blown apart or would at least be cloudy from the blows that it's taken
I bought this as a gift for my husband. He absolutely loves it! This is a great watch at a great price
I had purchased similar earrings elsewhere, but  had a problem because they weren't hypoallergenic. When I saw these, I got them immediately. Have had no problems since
This is a great tool set. The first day I had it, we used it to take out a link from my new watch. It worked great. I'm glad I bought it. It will be a very handytool kit
the pendant was beautiful and was loved by the person I gave it to
Silver Insanity does it again, bringing high quality, unique jewellery to the masses at affordable prices. This necklace is so gorgeous one has to see it up close to fully appreciate it. It is so detailed, even the tiny thorns are so delicate and perfectly placed. This is such a beautiful piece of jewellery that no woman should be without. This Valentine's Day (or anniversary or birthday) instead of buying your woman chocolates that she doesn't need or flowers that will die after a few days, buy her a gorgeous, unique rose that will last forever
These earrings are beautiful.  They are big, so they look best if worn by themselves.  Very light so they are very comfortable
The shape of this pendant is very flattering (elongated, draws the eye downward).  It looks great with the "Windows" hoops I purchased at the same time.  The chain is nice, and as with all Zina sterling - the silver is very polished and beautiful
Nice ring, fast delivery.  I still need to check it out, because my daughter says it doesn't completely "break down" the way my old puzzle ring did
I bought these for my wife, and she really likes them.  They're small enough that she can wear them day-to-day, but they're nice enough for formal occasions as well.  This is a very versatile set of earrings at a great price
I am not the type of person that wears JEWELRY, but when I went shoping for a watch, because I needed one, one brand caught my eye...Fossil. Everyone knows Fossil, so, Everyone knows that they make good watches. I like this watch because of the color and because it has the day # on the face. It is like your everyday watch, but with that BLING look. VERY COOL and VERY JAMES BOND. If you know what I mean. I plan to wear this watch everywhere I go. You should get this one not only because it looks cool but because of the price. You know that $$$ makes up your mind for you
Great watch, looks very similar to a movado but worth the price. Sharp look and perfect for any occasion
I was searching the web for weeks... I saw thousands of watches... and I didn't like them. When I saw THIS watch... that was IT - one of the most beautiful watches in the world.I think design of this watch is superb - very simple, but astonishingly beautiful and original.But there is one PROBLEM with this watch - it can be purchased only in North America. Being from Europe, I had difficulties to get it
Very good quality for the price.  They are simple, understated, and classic in design.  If you want flashy, however, these are not for you.  You can ignore the 1-star reviews--the 1-star rating goes to those who a) don't read the description before ordering, b) don't know what mm stands for, or c) don't have the visual-spatial skills to estimate the size of the earring in the picture by comparing the overall size to the earwire (which tends to be a fairly similar size on most earrings).  And please, if you can't tell 14k from $5.00 dimestore stuff that will likely turn your ears green, then your money is wasted here.  Go to Walmart and get yourself something big and cheap
Great value for the price.  Better than expected in person.  Quality watch for the price.  Love this undersea face better than the other models out there.  Was happy to find out that even though the band is "kid sized", it also fits adult women's wrist.Highly recommend.  Will probably buy one or 2 more
I got these for $9 on the Friday Sale.  They are well made and the perfect size.  You absolutely will not find a better pair for the price.  Wait for the Friday Sale if you can
The necklace is lovely.  It arrived soon after purchase in a handsome velvet case.  Quite a bargain
The watch looks great; prominent, yet not overly large.  The orange really sets off the look.  The large luminescent indexes are easy to see long after dark.  I also like having both day and date complications, and to find an automatic watch with these features for less than $300 (way less on Amazon) is really a find.  You will need a pro to adjust the bracelet, though, as each link pin is held in by two tiny bushings that are impossible to replace without the proper jeweler's tools.  Another bother is that the watch gains over a minute a day.  Overall, I really like it.  It's become my daily wear watch. 
I have seen many other winders in the market with the same features but with much higher prices.  This winder is so quiet that I have no problem sleeping even with it on.  I highly recommend it
I love the jewel jet because it is exactly what my jeweler uses except now I can clean my diamond at home when I want.It is easy to use. Just follow the directions
I got this as agift in she likesd it very much
I wanted a basic watch that would be for everyday use and liked this Timex design.  I was very pleased that it looked even nicer in person...clear face, leather band with slightly heavier stitching than some, good weight (not too heavy).  I have received a few compliments at work/co-workers were surprised at the value for the cost.  Overall, a solid Timex offering that you will enjoy if you're drawn to the style/image that appears here in the product details
I was so happy in receiving the watch so fast.They do good business
Could not have gotten a better deal. It has been working for the last 2 months. Very quite, I leave it in the bedroom. Can't beat the price.Recommended for those automatic watch lovers, you can buy 4 of these for the price of an others model
I bought these earrings for my Stepmother in Seattle, so I never actually saw them.  Now she is a refined person with classy taste, so you can't just get her any piece of junk.  She said they were perfect and she loved them. That's a great recommendation!
its beautiful But the heart look large  in the picture but in realty it's small but i think it's better
I've had two Skagen Watches and have to say they are my favorite. I love the large face and the Titanium bracelet (you don't have to remove the watch in order to shower!). A lot of people have complimented me on the watch, too. Given the price and quality, you can't go wrong. If you ever need a part replaced, you just send it to Skagen; the work is completed in a couple of weeks! In summary: an elegant watch at a reasonable price
This watch is generally a good watch, but there are some flaws in ours--not a surprise considering the price.  One, there is a white haze under the crystal when viewed in the sunlight--perhaps the result of careless manufacturing and cleaning.  Two, my son has had the band come apart twice in one month.  The later probably a design issue relative to all the spring-loaded retainers and such, and the general range of movement of the clasp
I loved the Wiccan Protection knot pendant, I purchased it for my daughter for Christmas and she hasn't taked it off since.  She had wanted a Celtic tricetta necklace, but absolutely adored this one just as much.  Thank you
I had one exactly like this one for over 20 years, but finally the crown fell off.  I am keeping it for a backup as it is still running just fine.I expect the same quality of my new Seiko.  I highly recommend this model.  Easy to read dial (especially the white face) and also a fine looking piece of jewelry
GREAT COLOR AND VERY WELL MADE. WHILE SMALL FOR A PRIMARY PIERCE IN THE LOBE THEY ARE THE PERFECT SIZE FOR MY SECOND PIERCE. THIS COMPANY ALSO MAKES BEAUTIFUL 1/2" HOOP EARRINGS SET WITH AMETHYST  THAT I'M VERY HAPPY WITH.
I haven't worn pierced earrings in years;I thought they were sealed. When I discovered that they were indeed open, I sought some simple gold post types to wear. When I saw my March birthstone set in a simple gold setting, I couldn't resist it. The actual earring is so elegant! 'Tis exactly as described, and more! Wearing such graceful simplicity in my beauty-starved lobes makes me feel like royalty! And for such a small price with the security of Amazon!What a joy! Sincerely,Miss Agnes Crosb
Everything was OK. I actually recommend
Actually, it's a fabulous watch.  It looks great, does everything that you would expect, and is a joy to look at - I've swapped it for a watch that my wife bought me for a wedding present "just to get used to it for a bit" (which obviously she's less than pleased about), and everytime I look at it I see a really great watch that I'm really pleased I bought.HOWEVER, if there was a design fault, it would be this: when you start and then stop the stop watch, you cannot reset without pressing and holding the reset button; surely it would be better for a one-touch reset?  Also, with the Timer - loop 3 (which is continuous countdown) the reset button (again press and hold) resets the timer to zero (as you would expect the 'set' button to do), and the set button (press and hold) resets the timer to the original timer setting (eg 5 mins) - surely these are the wrong way round?  All a bit odd, but sort-of OK once you get used to it.  Seems a bit sloppy though in its design.Nonetheless, overall an excellent watch.  I'm really please I bought it and it's very useful for triathlon events, using the lap on the stopwatch
When I received this item I could not believe how beautiful it was.  The price was insane for the quality and workmanship. I will order more for my sisters
This is a really nice little pendant/necklace.  The stones are not too small, not too big -- the pendant is about 1" long.  The bail is large enough to accommodate a nice chain (it comes with an 18" fine chain, but you might want to replace it with something a bit more substantial).For the price, I was expecting something a lot "cheaper" looking.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this. 
I love this watch. It was my Christmas present to myself.  The ribbons are easy to interchange, and I wear them with the silver bracelet, as well.  It comes in a cute and durable box that I now use to store all of my watches.  A perfect gift and good quality.  I especially like the little heart on the minute sweep
I have bought this watch for him every 6 years.  He has owned three so far.   After replacing the battery, it is not as water resistant.  Also, the band has broken on two out of the three of the watches.  I gave it 4 stars because of the degradable band.  No other watch has movable bezel, analog and digital time, with an alarm, for under $100.00. 
I was surprised at the quality. The bracelet and necklace matched perfectly. It was a great gift for my 23-year old daughter. She loved them
I was very pleased with the service of this seller.  The earrings came within a few days, and I love them.  I have been asked more than once where I got them.  Thanks
I am delighted to get my new Timex watch. It is  even prettier than its picture!  It is easy to set, too.  I bought this watch for its looks and the larger dial, so I am very satisfied.  It will need links removed, but one size just doesn't ever fit all
This watch was purchased as a gift and I was pleasantly surprised when I received it.  The quality is excellent.  I had read in another review that the watch was a little bulky, but I found it to be in line with watches of the same type.  This watch works well with casual and work attire and I was tempted to keep the watch for myself.  In fact I regret not purchasing one for me to keep.  Buy with confidence.
I bought these earrings for my niece, and after they arrived, I immediately ordered another pair for myself. I find them actually nicer in reality than in the picture. The size is perfect, and the amethysts, although very small, add just a little color accent. I bought them on sale for $15 instead of the usual $50, and I am very, very pleased with what I got for the price
This is one of the best watches available and I have no regrets whatsoever with my purchase at a real bargain price from Amazon
I love this bracelet but the clasp is seriously defective.  I contacted Sabrina, and they were great about sending me a new one ASAP, with a label for returning the other one.  That was impressive, and such responsive customer service is not to be undervalued.  Still, the clasp is a product defect, and I'm sure one of these days I will probably loose the bracelet b/c it comes undone unknowingly
I bought this for my husband.  He likes the large, easy to read numbers and says the expandable band is comfortable.  A very nice watch at a reasonable price. 
After a good deal of shopping both online and in retail stores we are delighted with the product, price, and service through amazon.com  -- I recomend this watch highly
I am in the Army and because of that this watch has it's pluses and minuses.  I travel the world, so the multiple time zones is awsome.  The time stamp feature is great for when I need help remember when a specific event happened.  As for the solar power.  It's great in that you don't have to worry about batteries, but most watch batteries last close to five years anyway.  In the Army I find myself doing lots of night missions, and I can go months without seeing the sun because I have to catch up on sleep during the day.  Well, this doesn't really work with a solar powered watch.  I get by, but it can be a hassle some times.  All-in-all, this is a great watch, and if you don't work at night then the solar power won't be a problem for you, except maybe in the winter when you wear coats that cover your wrist.  Just take that into consideration when purchasing a solar powered watch
The earrings delivered were as described and will certainly work for me.  I was a bit disappointed in the strength and flexibility of the gold wire.  These earrings were much more flexible that the 25-year-old pair I was replacing.  I doubt that the new ones are as strong and will hold up as well.  However, they do what I need them to do and can be worn around the clock without irritation
I purchsed this watch a while ago and I have to say it is simply great. The animated feature is simply the face switching between red and black which can be set to hold at either color, which is a feature I have found to to very fuctional as it allows for me to switch to the color that better complitments what I am wearing. I have had this watch for nearly a year and it still gets comlpiments weekly. My only criticism comes from the fact that it is not like some of more of the trend watches that have a wide band that actually cuff around the entire wrist, from which this watch takes its styling cues. Nevertheless, it is still a great watch that looks good
this is a tiny, compact watch with elegant design. it is fit for the women attending the formal parties. plus, it works great. this price deserves its value
I believe the heart shaped locket is a one-of-a-kind thing.  It is appropriately sized to allow for sufficient size pictures while not being too large.  The silver is clean and smooth looking just like the pictures.  Due to the size of the locket, a dainty, smaller chain is sturdy but does not detract from the locket.  Therefore, while I was concerned about the chain size and negative reviews, I took a risk and am happy with this purchase.  The pictures were easy to insert and there is a plastic film to put over the pictures for finger prints and some protection.Good gift.Sincerely,The guy who usually blows it on the Valentine's Day gift.
This is a beautiful watch storage box. Great value. My husband is a watch collector. Plenty of room for the large Invicta and Croton watches. Nice design and color. A must have for anyone with a extensive watch collection.
Oddly, the SKX175 I received is actually a SKX009K! What a steal at $129!The watch is a 5-star based on price alone. But the jubilee bracelet gets a 1-star!! It's cheap feeling and loose. The center links are fold-over, NOT solid. At this price though, it's not surprising that something got cheaped out like that.Overall, I give it a 4-star rating. Missing tag!!! False advertising (perhaps to the benefit, as the 009K is perceived a little better) that it's really a SKX009K rather than a SKX175 (has Singapore labeling on lower edge of dialface, whereas the SKX009K does not have any country markings). Great buy for sure!!cheers
This is SUCH a gorgeous bracelet! I'm glad I ordered it for myself.
I was browsing through Amazon when I came upon Nvie jewelry and I absolutely love it! I bought this necklace for my mom for her birthday, but had a hard time not keeping it for myself. The necklace was really nice, well constructed, and it was shipped quickly. It looked just like the picture, but I have a feeling that each piece of jewelry is truly one-of-a-kind.I would recommend Nvie Designs to anyone for buying really lovely, affordably priced jewelry.
I was impressed with the quality of this pendant including the packaging!  I've received several complements on the quality and unique design.  For me it signifies John 15:5 "I am the vine and you are the branches..."I am very pleased with this fine piece of jewelry.  Thank you
Exceptional value for the money! The watch is beautiful and the recipient was particularly impressed that it had the correct time and date upon his opening the present.  No more watches that say the 31st on the 1st of the month
These earrings are perfect to wear every day: * they are comfortable to sleep in - no need to take them off in the evening* they are small and classy - will look great with any outfitThey are exactly what I was looking for, and I'm really happy with them.To help you see the size of these earrings and how they look on someone's ear, I've uploaded an image of this earring in my ear - see it in "Customer Images"
But no calories count.I love this watch despite that, it's well designed, the chest strap also links to the machines in the gym (most that say POLAR ready).. so that was a great surpriseThe chest strap has a battery that is user-serviceable as well as the watch, so you don't have to send it to the manufacturer (like the POLAR HR).Overall I think is a good buy, but the is missing the calories count, that would be my only upgrade.
The 30 reviews before mine gave pretty complete description about the watch. I'll just say it fits very well on my relatively small wrist.If you like the watch but think it won't fit well because you have small wrist. Don't worry, it fits just fine. Enjoy.After wearing this watch for few weeks, I realized I am just like many others, wearing the Calibre 2100 exclusively now.
I absolutely love these earrings. Very well made, beautiful design and a lot of silver
Very delicate, very pretty chain.  It doesn't kink up when I wear it, and it's the perfect length.  I have worn this every day since I received it
We don't call our Nana grandmother, so this necklace is perfect
These are very nice, light weight earrings.  The look silver and black even though they are not so keep that in mind when you purchase them as to what the will go with.  I wear lots of black so it was a pleasant surprise for me.  Very antique look to them
I have skin allergies, and was not able to find a watch that I could have on my skin until I found this watch. The price of the watch could not be beat, for the chance that I could not have it on. Thank you for suppling a great watch.
We got these earrings for our daughter on her 6th birthday. She loves jewelry and especially earrings. The color is a little pale, the actual earrings aren't quite as pink as they look in the picture. But they are good quality and look great. My daughter wears them all the time.This was a good buy. These earrings are great for anyday wearing or with evening wear. They look very stylish
This watch was a gift for my husband. He loves it! He wanted a slim watch he could "wear around" and this is it
I love the look but was a little unhappy with the quality of the small melee diamonds used around the dial of the watch.  They are very milky and personally, I think the watch would look better without them at all if that's the only quality they had.  Great looking and I'm glad I finally bought it for myself.
let me just say my girlfriend loved them and then loved m
I love this bracelet.  It's very pretty & looks just like it was shown.  Looks expensive & tasteful.  I have bigger wrists, so I'd like it better if it came in larger sizes..but it goes great with my watch
I received the necklace and realized that the color was a little more orange than red.  I bought it for a friend and I think she will like it regardless.  The pendant is very large
Nice quality.  It is a shame that they do not have the same in longer cords as well
bought this as a gift for my brother.  he was impressed by the quality and feel of the watch.  he wears it, so i think i did pretty good considering he's a tough person to buy something for
best item I bought for a great price- I would like to see more like thi
As most people do, I had accumulated several different types of cookware over the years.  It was a real treat to pass these onto my kids and just use this great Cuisinart Chef's Classic set.  I especially love the saute pan
Like many people, I have ignorant neighbors that allow their yappy mutt to bark on and on and on. Despite talking to the neighbor politely and such, they still have no concern for the noise pollution. I was losing sleep, and the barking was getting so bad that I even considered moving! In desperation, we looked online for something to stop barking dogs. We came across Viatek's Super Bark Stop and decided to risk the money.WOW, talk about being worth the money! My husband affixed the device on a piece of wood, and staked it about 5 feet high in our back yard. It's unsightly, yes, but we're the only ones to really see it. More importantly, it's RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE BARKING MUTT. The first time he tested it, he told me the dog about jumped out of its skin! We laughed gleefully. Could a good night's sleep actually be on the horizon...?It's been several days and Super Bark Stop has worked AMAZINGLY. The dog will lie as far as it can away from the device...when it usually lay in the middle of the neighbor's yard. If it starts to yelp a little, it stops almost immediately. It's as if it's afraid to bark. YAY!You can select the volume, tone, and number of barks to help eliminate false activation (say, from talking or loud bird squawking). Audible and inaudible both work fine, but we now keep it on inaudible at the two bark setting.The device is waterproof plastic and you need 4 D batteries (not included) to operate it. I am SO thankful we found Super Bark Stop! My nerves were really getting jangled and I was dreading early mornings, when they put the mutt outside. It's amazing at how inconsiderate neighbors are; just because you may want a dog doesn't mean I want saddled with its noise while you neglect it!P.S. After using Bark Stop for 2 weeks (yes, it did work!), we noticed that the neighbors dog started to bark a bit more. (Not as bad as before, though.) We had it on silent, and realized that it had stopped working. Apparently, it's not 100% waterproof, despite the claims of the manufacturer. The person I bought it from said that "once it's opened, we find that it's not 100% waterproof". Well guess what? You gotta open it to put the batteries in it! Either buy a faux bird house to protect Bark Stop or house it where it won't get wet. Otherwise, you may find yourself in the same position we were in. We got a refund, and fortunately for us, our neighbors got rid of their dog...so we didn't bother getting a new one
Product arrived promptly,in good condition! This product costs twice as much at Vets office. Somebodies making money!!!
It's a very secure for children. My daughter is happy with this produc
Recently purchased this in mid-2006 and it is the best cookware item I have ever owned and used.  As one of those millions who rely on mid-line priced discount department store brands, I can state with 100% certainty I was amazed (and still am) with the high-performance this item offers!  The clean-up is still a dream-come-true, all I have to do is get it in the sink and with a very very small amount of liquid dish detergent clean and rinse, it practically cleans itself.  My burners are all equal size (gas stove) and highest setting is "6" I have learned all I have to do for pancakes is level 3!!  Cooking bacon, an entire pound, is no problem for this cookware.  I do want to purchase more of this item, there is a smaller griddle version of this item also available.  I'm even thinking of slowly switching to this brand "All-Clad" nonstick
My husband and I fight over this plate when we have frozen pizza. A Tombstone pizza fits great on this plate
I've used this for Indian food and it worked really well - you an prepare the meat and keep it on the part with the heat off before you mix it back into the masala.BTW I own other Anolon Advanced saucepots and love the way they cook and cleanup.Re: the squishy handle. If you have gripping problems, as many middle age to older cooks do, this helps you.  Don't listen to the young, self-involved, and obviously inexperienced cooks who blast this feature.  Some day they too will develop weak wrists or arthritis and will appreciate this feature
Excellent, when you want to bake a small cake this is absolutely a great small just the right size of a cake form
I bought this glass for my wife (who has a great interest and enjoyment of good wine) as a Christmas gift.  Last night, she tried out the glass with a friend.  The reviews from both of them were quite something to watch.  The wine from this glass tasted far, far superior to the same wine from an "ordinary" red wine glass.  In fact, they poured the remaining wine from the "ordinary" glass into this glass and shared the glass all evening.  There was really no doubt that this glass made the wine drinking experience a totally different, superior one
The grill is a significant improvement over my previous Weber in regards to:-grill area-regidity of the cast iron grill-control for raising or lowering goals-large charcoal shelf-three compartments within the charcoal shelf-heavy guage metal construction-the option of adding a rotisserieThe grill is wanting in regards to:-lack of an enamel coating on the cast iron grill-lack of closable upper and lower vents which would enable greater temperature control and the ability to seal the grill interior when finished in order to snuff out the coals
We were very skeptical.  One of our cats would mark certain spots (like corners) occassionaly.  But we had no idea that he was daily marking the area rug in our living room! It got so bad that we had to discard the rug.  We tried Boundary spray which would keep him away from the usual corner spots for a day, but the one time we forgot to spray, he would mark again.  We were at our wits end and decided to try Feliway.  We bought two diffusers and placed them near his usual marking spots.  At first we also used the Boundary, but eventually we stopped using the spray and noticed that we didn't see any urine markings anymore.  It took a few months but we can honestly say that the product seems to work.  Our cat even appears more calm and pleasant.  We make sure that we replace the container of Feliway every 5 weeks or so.  It's well worth the money
I love this -  had seen items like it and so broke down.  Now I am sorry I have not had one for years and year
This color is a bit too bright, but the bag it very comfortable
This product is a must have for anyone serious about baking.  This mixer is by far the best appliance that I have purchased for my kitchen next to the refrigerator of course.  I reccomend this product to anyone who loves to bake.  The 5 quart + was worth the money, don't buy the 4 qt, save the money and purchase the 5, you'll be glad that you did
Love it!  Fluffy, warm, and light.  Perfect for snuggling up into on those cold, blustery days or for building a make-shift fort.  :)  Big enough to comfortably cover (and keep warm) many people.  And it's wonderfully light, so it doesn't bog you down while you sleep.  Wonderful
This soap dish is beautiful, practical and sturdy. Best of all, it will retain all water and liquid soap leftovers in its tray, leaving your bathroom clean and dry.Recommended. 
Absolutely FAB!!! Shiny-bright stainless steel, matches Frieling French Press, and any other stainless tableware/countertop items perfectly! Just the right size for serving a table of 4 or so...of course the sugar bowl holds plenty- note you'll likely need to refill the creamer for a second cup go-around at a table seating 4-6 coffee lovers. Overall these are just VERY sturdy/solid, clean-up beautifully and very easily, and, by the way, the sugar spoon included with the lid-covered sugar bowl dispenses an exact teaspoon of sugar, and sets inside the little 'notched' area of the lower bowl, so that the spoon rests perfectly inside the sugar bowl while the the lid remains covered/on at the same time- a really simple, yet European-engineered, well-thought out design & quality. I fully anticipate that this will be an heirloom hand me-down...although it's a l-o-o-o-ng time until I'll be distributing my assets! Make sure to buy the matching Frieling French Press- it's just incredible, & also heirloom quality! Give yourself the gift of European quality coffeeware- it's one of life's simple, yet indispensible indulgences!  PS the Frieling French Coffee Press w/ this matching sugar/creamer set makes a unique and favorite wedding gift too
I've got a dog, cat and a small child- my floors have been a mess! I am so glad I bought this vaccuum- the suction is great and it picks up all the animal hair. Great price, too. I would highly reccomend this to anyone, especially people with pets- we emptied it 4 times just doing the living room the day we got it in the mail. Now my hubby vaccuums regulary- he loves it too
This stainless steel stock pot is just right for those of us who can't fit our favorite soup recipes into a dutch oven. Cleaning it is a breeze, and it is still small enough to fit on a convenient cabinet shelf. That says it all
I like this grater. It's easy to use and clean. And, nothing is better on salad than freshly grated cheese
I have been using this cushion for a couple of years now.  I use to be able to buy it at Walgreens but they no longer carry it.  I was so happy when I found it on Amazon.  I have several of the cushions around.  I keep one in my car, one at home, one at work, and now I have one to travel with.  I take it on airplanes when I travel.  I have broken my tailbone twice and the shape of the cushion takes pressure off of the tailbone.  I have recommended it to relatives and friends and they all pruchased it and love it
After reading reviews on the wok's available on Amazon[.com], I decided on this Wok due to the ability to put it in the dishwasher.  Turns out it is a bit to large to put in my dishwasher, but it is very easy to hand clean.   The non-stick surface has lasted, but I am careful to only use plasic or wood, and I wash it with a cloth and soap.  It gets to temperature quickly during cooking, the only 'complaint' I have is the simmer cycles (not a constant heat, but on and off).  I purchased some Thai cook books, (Real Thai, and Thailand The Beautiful Cook Book) and was amazed with the correct ingredients and a Wok, how easy it is to prepare my favorite food.  The difference the wok made- I was able to cook at the correct temperatures.  My stove BTU is apparently quite low, it took forever to 'sizzle' so the food turned to mush before it was cooked.  I now use the wok for anything I want to cook fast and/or warm up
I bought these sheets 6-8 months back. I have been using these sheets regularly. Even after many wash I don't see the sign of lint coming out. This seems to be one of my great value for money.  . Very soft and cozy.  . Excellent for winter.  . Even after many wash there are no sign of lints  . Excellent for the price
I was one of the lucky ones to get this king size comforter. It appears to be a little on the thin side, but is very warm. I got this for the dogs and they seem to like it. The pillow shams are only standard instead of king. Very good price too. ! ! ! !
As a vintner we remove the CO2 from the wine as part of our process.  This device uses CO2 to "pop" the cork--very clever.  However this minor introduction of CO2 is insignificant and will vent quickly.  At times there is an off-taste --like a lubricant or something which affects the initial taste of the wine. Let it breath for a while -- 5 minutes or so and it seems OK.  This device works well on corks, but is a hit and miss on composites and plastics.  Do not use it on partially filled bottles as it takes to much gas from the small cylinder to be effective.REW
We bought this canister set to compliment the stoneware we purchased from the same set.  I am especially impressed with the seal used on these canisters.  You would swear it is mechanical; the lids open easily, yet seal tight when simply placing the lid on the canister.  They are very high quality and look much better than the stainless steel ones we were considering before finding these.  Recommended
I recently purchased this double boiler and I am very happy with it.  It is a good quality stainless and that is important.  I love the "vintage" style, it is a satin finish and has an interesting shape, much like one that Grandma had many years ago.  The boiler insert is 6" deep, not counting the lid, and perfect for making frosting, candy, custard, anything that requires gentle cooking.
I really like these glasses.  They are attractive and pleasant to hold.  I prefer having a wine glass that doesn't contain a lot of wine - which is why I got these since they are the smallest in this line
This is by far the best toaster we've ever owned. It does not have the thin metal elements that glow red like a conventional, so I don't know how it works yet, but it gets the toast perfectly brown on each side. A fan comes on and stays on to cool it down during and for a brief period after operation. The bagels we toasted in it were just perfect!The microwave is large enough inside for my purposes, which are usually just reheating foods and defrosting. I never use microwave popcorn so I can't say how well it does in that area, but the frozen burrito I cooked last night came out terrific.Regarding the comment one reviewer said about it not being space saving, I think what the company is referring to is the fact that, while the unit itself might have somewhat of a large footprint, it eliminates the need to have a separate toaster. This does indeed save space, not to mention an electrical outlet. Overall, I'm very pleased with it, but haven't had it long enough to speak to its longevity. I can tell you that it's almost worth buying for the toaster alone
A good way to make a cup of coffee.  Particularly good if you want a fresh brewed taste, but don't need to brew a full pot for only one or two people.  Can be stored in a cabinet or drawer, eliminating the use of counter space.  A must have for small kitchens
Excellent value towels! Wash first so absorbantcy is best right away. Blue color is gorgeous
I needed a canister vacuum that wasn't too expensive that did a decent job on my hardwood and laminate floors.  This vacuum worked out well.  All we had was an upright and it just didn't cut it for our floors.  This turned out to be a good product for the price
I just received this griddle today and am SO disappointed to find on the small print on the box (and NOT in Amazon's description!) that this griddle can NOT be used on ceramic top stoves. It's a beautiful piece of cookware, heavyweight and with grease pour spouts at the edges. Exactly what I wanted, but very unfortunate that Amazon doesn't tell you that it won't work with some stoves. The warning on the box actually says that using this griddle on a ceramic stove can break the ceramic top. Probably would have given it 5 stars if I could have used it
We have finished our basement and have a home theater room which is on the cool side.  WE bought this heater to warm up the room and it works great
I got tired of dragging out my trusty box grater to do small jobs like grating nutmeg, ginger or Parmagiana Reggiano so I picked this little gem up. It feels good in your hand (no surprise there...it's what Oxo is known for)is well-made and cleans up beautifully...every time. It is so easy now just to grab this guy and grate what needs to be grated that I find I am using whole spices more and more. Grab yourself one of these...you'll love it
Who needs the high tech stuff? This little frother couldn't be better! It works killer within seconds! It even works on my soymilk! I'm so impressed
Completely satisfied it boils fast and looks great on the kitchen counter. From   England so used a lot for cups of tea.Have tried several makes but cant beat this for quality and price M.William
My mom has arthritis in her hands pretty bad. Most peelers are difficult to impossible for her to use. Not this one, it works flawlessly. It is easy to hold in her hand, and the blade is sharp enough to do a great job on potatos and carrots
This rascal works GREAT!  I put a half frozen bagel in it and it cut through no problem!I would HIGHLY recommend it over a holder and knife
When I was looking to purchase a new machine, I only was looking for a Bunn. Bunn makes the best coffee machines, none can compare. Every diner, coffee house, and Dunkin' Donuts only use Bunn machines. The A10 is one great machine! Brews perfect cups of coffee hot and quickly. Everyone in my office is very happy with the unit. If you're a serious coffee drinker, please don't cheap out on a Mr.Coffee, Braun or Krupps-- frankly they cannot brew coffee at the speed, temperature, or taste of a Bunn unit. I bought the A10 to replace a Bunn unit that I used for 10 years without a glitch
you would never know it was reconditioned, it is probably even better than new, plus being dishwasher friendly makes even easier to use..
I wanted to dress up my kitchen a little, and this does the trick (makes me not dread washing the dishes.  An added plus!).  It's a nice cherry red, and I'm a bit of a "red junkie."  I gave this five stars because it's perfect for my needs.  If you have a large family and tons of dishes it's going to be on the small side though.  The red colander's a great extra, as is the little sponge holder (it has suction cups to keep it in place, but mine doesn't seem to stay stuck.  That's a minor detail, though, and it could have more to do with my kitchen's tiling than the suction cups).  One thing to note--if your sink's drains aren't centered you might be annoyed with the hole in the middle of the rubber sink mat.Overall, this is a durable and nice to look at sinkware set.  What more could we want? 
I have used Patton air circulators for the last twenty years,and if you are looking for something much more effecient thanthe common box fan that you see in department stores, this isreally a fan. The first one I bought had the C.F.M. rating onit, which was 9600----They don't put that on the fan anymore,but it is a three speed fan that will really circulate someair, and can be adjusted to blow straight up. Nothing I haveseen even comes close for the money---
Do your banana's turn brown and mushy before you have a chance to eat them?  This used to be a huge problem in my house.  But now that I have the Lipper Beechwood Collection Banana Hanger this is no longer an issue.I hang my bananas up the moment I get home from the grocery store.  They think they are still on the tree out in the wild!  Silly bananas...Green bananas turn yellow quicker when they are hanging and yellow ones stay yellow longer.  Once, I got a bunch of those little mini bananas and those even fit on the hanger!The Lipper Beechwood Collection Banana Hanger is compact and doesn't take up much counter space which is a definite plus.  And it's almost like art in my kitchen putting those bananas on display
This was the second highest rated bundt pan in Cook's Illustrated.  I used an oil/flour baking spray and my bundt cake popped out with ease.  It's lightweight but perfect for me since I only use it a few times a year
I was a little skeptical because of the affordable price but I gave this set a try and love it. The pieces are heavy enough to maintain a consistant heat and are very durable. Clean up is a breeze.  I am very happy with this set and will be purchasing other pieces.
I got this for my mother and I wasn't too sure about the color I had originally wanted a darker color- but this arrived and was SUCH an excellent product ... My mother loves and when I seen it on her bed it made me want one - this is one of the BEST deals I have gotten on amazon .. Love it
Finally a quiet vacuum with some serious suction!  I have a 200 year old farm house that really needs this vacuum and has been smiling since it arrived.  The suction power on this vac is high enough to clean cracks that have never before been cleaned.  The hepa filter means you really can't smell that you've been vacuuming and the bags are a breeze to change.  Also, who can complain about having a hip appearing vacuum cleaner?  Hey, if you have to own one, wouldn't you prefer to have one that's easy on the eye? 
These hangers were exactly what I was looking for at a great price! They're the first hangers I've purchased in a long time that don't leave bumps in the sleeves of my clothing. I would recommend these hangers
I must admit I'm really surprised at just how great this little stick vacuum is.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it's still too early as I've only had it for a month or so, and things may change quickly considering the amount of use it's been given.  We have two seaside vacation rental cottages along with our own home, and have been using this vacuum in all three places at least twice a week.  Along with the normal amount of dirt and dust we also have the sand factor to deal with, and so far there has been no problem.  I highly recommend this little guy, and in fact may get two more to put into the cottages instead of carting this one all over the place.One suggestion though. Wonder how long it'll be before someone comes up with a combination of corded and cordless model. That way it could be constantly recharging when using it in the electric mode. 
Its a great product! good quality. Not enough velco (sp) for the bumpers , my bulldog takes them right off
I literally received the order 1 day after placing it.  Thank you
We bought this waffle maker because the American ones are hard to find. And this one got great reviews. So given that we prefer American waffles to Belgian waffles, we still like this waffle maker OK. Very easy to clean, and definitely non-stick
This was the first item that I purchased on Amazon.  Item was received in excellent condition, and in a very timely manner.  Very pleased
I was shopping in a gift store today and came across this Tovolo Tea Infuser and it is brillant!  If you don't use tea bags and are used to the infuser on a chain - this will spoil you.  It stirs like a spoon and when you are done it sits in its craddle so that it doesn't drip on anything.  And the whole thing is dishwasher safe.  I paid more than $9.95 for mine too
I got a good deal on this and it turned out to much better than expected.  Well made with a sharp edge that holds up.  The only reason for a 4 is the handle is not the most comfortable or secure grip. 
I've searched all over for a doubler that was less than 32" and this works great!  I have short closet bars so most doublers caused my lower bar clothes to drag on the floor.  This product lets me pick the length I need.  It's metal materials makes it quite durable too.  Hooray
I used this skillet for the first time and it was great. I love cast iron but the enamel coating sure made this easier to use. It cleaned quickly and required no seasoning. Also, its a really pretty skillet.The sellers were really good also about emailing with order status updates, shipping info and the skillet came quickly through Fed Ex. Very good customer service
My husband suggested this as a birthday gift for me. I thought okay until I opened the package. This shamrock green is so pretty. This dinnerware is great. A nice heavyweight. The glazing is brillant. And the cereal bowls are a good size. Not too small as other types tend to be. I am very happy I own this and have bought more since
The Krups XP 2070 has been in use at my household for about a month now, with no problems to speak of.  We use the espresso machine with cappucino attachment almost daily, and each time it has been very good.  A notice I would give to the espresso enthusiast looking to buy would be the need for a different tamper than the one provided.  The provided tamper is plastic, and can be wobbly, but I am very satisfied with the product
My six month old son would not eat anything off a spoon or out of a bottle.  Finally I tried mixing baby cereal and putting it in this.  Then I mixed cereal and babyfood and/or mashed food.  He loves it!  No gagging either!  I'm here now buying the replacement bags
This knife has made me eat more vegetables, just because it's so much fun to chop carrots.  I was a little concerned with the handle at first, but it's very comfortable, and isn't slick at all, even in soapy water.  I also worried that maybe I should have gotten the bigger version of this knife.  Again, my fears were unfounded, as this was the perfect size for vegetable preparation.  You can't really describe the feeling of using the best tool for the job... but if you've ever had that feeling, you already know how you'll feel using a Global.  When I slice carrots for snacks, they come out as perfect, translucent discs.  Any vegetable I've cut has been a joy
I've owned a Littermaid Mega for about 5 years and I really wish I had been able to buy this stand sooner. We have two cats and we're terribly lazy. We've had this stand for a few months and it works as described. It has drastically reduced the smell and the need to clean the box. WE LOVE THIS STAND and it has made life a lot more bearable when it comes to the litter box.Our old Littermaid just died on us and we went to replace it with a new Littermaid Elite but the stand isn't large enough. The newer Elite model is much longer than this stand and it will hang off the back and over the sides. We love that stand more than we want the newer Littermaid Elite and we are getting a great deal on the old style of the Littermaid Mega from Amazon. I would just be aware, before buying this, that it only fits the old style of Littermaids. That being said, if you're handy with power tools and woodwork than you might be able to modify it...it is a simple design.
I am really enjoying my Sunbeam mixer. It mixes good altho I'm not to crazy about the button to raise the mixer it is a little hard to push. I would buy another one if I had to.
I purchased these sheets together with the Pike Street 800 thread count sheet set as they were being offered as a combo special, made on the page if you wanted to order the 800 thread count sheets, which I did, and I cannot tell you how thrilled I am with both sets of sheets. If you can still get them both together(amazing price)you should, you will not be disappointed at all. They are both very well made & wonderful to sleep on. I have an 18" thick mattress and they fit perfectly. My husband and I love good quality sheets & and we both highly recommend these. The few wrinkles that you may find after they come out of the dryer should in no way affect your decision to buy these wonderful sheets and miss out on this sheer elegance. I mean after all, you deserve it, you are worth it, so go for it. For my husband and I, an incredible nights sleep in total comfort.....PRICELESS
I was glad to see the unit arrived without damage- (despite  poor packaging supplied by the manufacturer).  The unit works great!
I received my butter dish in a very timely fashion & very well packaged too.  The product is wonderful & it's being used on a daily basis.  I am extremely happy with the product & the shipper
I ordered two of these great Fiesta handled carafes in black.  I plan to use them for serving pieces as well as for accent pieces.  Black is hard to come by at the local retail outlets in my area so I had to order mine without the benefit of scrutinizing the quality of finish before purchase.  I have noticed at the retail places that blemishes often show up on the pieces.  I was not happy when I received my carafes and both of them had glaze skips (where the white under the glaze shows through) as well as scratches in the glaze (which I have never seen before and can't imagine what happened to put them there).  In my opinion these pieces should have been culled at the factory and sold as seconds.  I love the pieces, I'm just dissappointed with the quality of the finish. I also received a black covered butter which was blemish free
 Excellant Co. to deal with. We had a few questions and they were answered immediately and there was a mailing problem and this Co. did everything correct and fast.  We highly reccommend this Co
If you have pets and are constantly dragging out your heavy vacuum cleaner, then you will love this one.  I bought this vacuum as a supplement to my large (and heavy) canister vacuum and have been pleasantly surprised by its ability to pick up pet hair.  Because of the small bagless chamber, you have to empty it frequently, so I wouldn't count on this vacuum as my only vacuum cleaner.  I wanted a lightweight vacuum to use on my hardwood floors and area rugs, specifically to pick up pet hair, and this vacuum exceeded my expectations.  I tried the Shark, a similar model made by Fantom, and another cordless vacuum and not one of them worked anywhere near as well as this one does (stay away from the Fantom cordless - by far the worst!!).  I don't think any cordless vacuum will have enough power to pick up pet hair like this one did.  Overall, this vacuum is a great little vacuum for quick clean-ups or to maintain pet-hair free area rugs.  One suggestion - use the carpet setting even on bare floors.  The brushes are high enough so they won't scratch bare floors, but the cleaning capability is much less without the rolling brush. I found that it just rolled over the dog hair without picking it up unless I used the carpet setting.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the small holding chamber which requires frequent emptying. 
We have an Aussie/Healer mix (we think...she was a foundling) with a thick, soft coat. I've had her professionally groomed once a year for about 7 years at $60 to $75 a pop so last summer I decided to try it myself with this clipper kit.  To make a long story short, she didn't turn out so bad! (Well, the neighbors didn't laugh, anyway!) It took me a while to get the hang of it--I finally chucked the various combs and went with the bare clippers--but she didn't complain and I had a "cool" dog for much less $$$ than a pro cut.  The best part was I could keep her trimmed all summer as her heavy coat grew back.  No report as yet how long the blades last, but I'm already money ahead even if I must replace them next year
Just what I was looking for, it is an odd sized cover that is hard to find.  Great quality also
I just bought 2 of these tables to use as nightstands. I have a very high bed, and thought they would be too short and too small...but they are perfect! I love the extra storage at the bottom, and the little drawer is very useful as well. Assembly took no time at all, and the tables turned out extremely sturdy. I am very pleased!
My dog absoluely loves this toy. We have had one since she was a puppy, over 6 years ago, and its still going. This is the only toy that she will play with for hours on end and gets excited when she see it. Definitely worth buying, it gives great excercise. We sometimes use it as a distraction when our dog gets anxious
When I pick up the brush both my dogs fight to be first.  My Chow has long hair that is always in knots on her backside.  This brush just plowed right through them and she never even seem to notice.  My Malamute thinks I have nothing better to do than use it on her.  It completely got rid of the odors.  My dogs rate it their second favorite thing in the house just under their food.  The most amazing thing was I had to buy a second brush as I found by accident that it works for me too.  I have very long hair that gets knotted very easy.  In a hurry one day I picked up their brush and in seconds the knot was gone.  No pulling no ripping of hair.  If you have the same trouble I suggest you give it a try.  Would be Super for kids
These are gorgeous bowls. They are my preferred bowl for baking and cooking. I am very satisfied with them - no discoloration problems and they clean up very easily. And they look fantastic on my pot rack
I gave it as a gift, she loved it since the granite roaster she had for over 20 years had gotten a small hole in the bottom from so much use.
I almost didn't purchase these because of the reviews, But my son likes Thomas, so I did. I was expecting really rough, but I don't think they are all THAT bad. Maybe the company has taken the reviews under consideration and changed material. Anyway, the boy is quite happy with them and sleeps quite soundly.
It does everything I need it to and more! I'm a raw foodist so I don't need something that will "cook" foods like some of the other high-powered blenders will. However, if that's what you need one for, this will do that, too. The L'equip is the only blender I have ever used without the lid (not advised for households with children). I can start it out at a crawl and go up to blindingly fast with a turn of the knob. I liked my original one so much that I bought one to have at the office so my green smoothies could be made fresh for lunch. Alton Brown was showing off his appliances on "Good Eats" and he has a L'equip, too. Made me feel famous
Gorgeous, Unique & Useful! I bought this as a gift and it is the recepient's favorite. Great gift...do not hesitate..Buy Now!
I had to replace my Space Saver B&D on a sunday morning.  I wanted another thermal carafe model but wasn't realy ready to shell out $80 for the Braun even witht the good reviews.  I found this on clearance at Target for $35 and I bought a Cuisinart gold filter for it.  I did not like the fact the Mr Coffee filter had a solid bottom to the gold filter.  Anways, there is not much I can say bad about this machine.Things I like:  looks,brew seletor,self clean feature,makes good coffee,the carafe is one the best I have used.  The easy change water filter disks are a nice feature as well, inexpensive and work pretty well.  I dont have any of the leak problems.  Things I would change: could make coffee a little hotter but not a deal breaker,the unit beeps 5 times when finished brewing not a big deal when everyone is up and moving but I tend to set it to go on before the family is up.  Overall for what I paid for this I'm very pleased
This is a great product for holding your knives.  My wife and I got a nice set of Henckel knives as a wedding present.  I couldn't figure out how I could transport the knives.  Along with the Blade Savers, this roll bag does a great job of protecting as well as allowing us to safely transport our knives
i've had one of these since 03/03, and the little thing is holding up just fine - i haven't even had trouble with calcium deposits after so long, as i thought i might, what with the hard water 'round these parts.  anyhow, my bodum ibis is heating away merrily...if it does die anytime soon, i'll be very very sad, as i've got the orange model.  but i'll replace it with another just like it, only in black
Excellent. Heavy duty and well made. The Satin Nickel looks expensive.   It stands about 13 " high with a good, strong  support base. It should last a lifetime.  jdg 3/6/0
We use it as supplemental heat in our apartment, raises the temp of our entire 1000 sq ft. apartement about 10 degrees with no problem (Our landlords have the thermostat). However check the shipping price... shipping nearly doubled the price on the item.
I received this coffeemaker as a Christmas gift and was initially skeptical of the thermal carafe being able to make hot coffee and the basket-style filter.  After using the maker for a week, I have to say my skepticism was unjustified.  This machine makes great-tasting coffee that is as hot as I could want it.  I never liked the "cooked" coffee that regular, glass-carafe makers produced - burned tasting after the first cup.  The coffee from this machine is consistent from the first cup to the last.  I fill the carafe with hot water, mill my beans and fill the reservoir, empty the carafe and enjoy.  After two hours, the coffee was still hot.  One great feature not highlighted is the front-fill aspect:  Kitchenaid designed the top with a channel to fill the reservoir by pouring the water from the front, right next to the filter.  No more struggling to pour water in the back and see the water level.  Extremely convenient.I have to disagree with the previous reviewer - this machine makes ten 5-ounce cups.  After reading the review, I double-checked the carafe capacity against my old Krups machine:  exactly 10 cups; more than enough for our household.  All in all, a great-looking, great-performing coffeemaker that meets Kitchenaid's high standards.  I highly recommend it
The best thing about this foil cutter is the magnetic back - I had been looking for another one for 6 months!  We just love it
I was searching for a speaker system with docking capabilities for my ipod video and boy did I find a nice one! With the arched back speaker portion of the stereo, it provides a surround-sound like atmosphere. Also it has quite a loud capacity for volume. I mean if you wanted to, you could really get it crankin'. Anyway, it charges your ipod for you just like the computer and it will accomadate any style ipod. The sound clarity is very crisp and clear. The only, tiny flaw, I could find in this fine piece of audio was that in between songs, a soft, high-pitched whine is sometimes incurred. However, once the song begins to play, this whine disapears immediately. I would strongly suggest purchasing this item if you would like a quality speaker system for a reasonable price
The price went down from $6.95 to $3.95.It's very nice looking,you will be pleased with it.Approximately 13 and a half inch square.I was expecting a black cloth loop to hang it from,but the loop turned out to be the sewn in label.That's okay
good fabric and nice size.  great for the price, free
Nice little toaster with good price.  Just be careful it can get really hot when toasting. 
I'm please with my coat rack.  I have several heavy jackets on it and it's sturdy as well as attractive.  I would recommend it, especially at the price
It does exactly what it says. State of the art cutlery, cutting vegetables becomes a pleasure. It is stunning the precision of this knife; you set it on the food push it and goes down the exact direction intended. It did not go 1/1000 of an inch to left or to the right. I used it for onion, and let me tell you; never in my life was so easy, at the end the onion was so small chopped. It felt like I was cutting air. I even bought a kitchen electric chopper precisely to use it for cutting onions. I do not need it anymore. The design it is so sleek and elegant! I felt in love with it only by seeing it on the picture, after a research on the internet I bought it and I am not sorry. I got tired to try and replace knives. Definitely, I will buy the Shun Set. I highly recommended, like no other product!
This coat rack is simple and sturdy.  It has several pegs for longer coats at the top and below are ones just the right height for my daughter to reach.  It can handle many coats and other items you toss on it without falling over.  Color is nice although we usually see little of it.
Have to disagree with the other reviewer here ...  I purchased a Baby biOrb recently for my new Betta, after having my first betta living in an airless bowl for a couple years.  I simply got tired of cleaning a stinky bowl every week. As a result, I went shoppin for a new tank with a bubbler and filter system and found the Baby biOrb.  While I agree that the maintence costs are significant at $132/ year (if you need to change a filter every 4 weeks), the costs balance with ease of maintenance.  Personally, my experience with cleaning the Baby biOrb was a snap with the optional suction hose.  Took me fifteen minutes to clean the tank, drain the grimey water and add new water.  Couldn't have been much easier.  And, I am not sure how anyone could have a problem swapping filter cartriges unless they have motor skills issues.I also built a noise dampening box for the air pump - my only real complaint is that the "whisper quiet" pump sounds like a mini jackhammer after about five minutes.Great product and looks awesome. 
Love the soup bowls.  They live up to the usual fiestaware quality as all of the other products from fiestaware.  So pick your color and enjoy
This is pretty in a rough casual sketched style. This will require ironing out of the dryer.
This little gadget is simple & cheap but you'd have to spend a lot more money to get a cup of coffee out of an electric coffee maker of the quality you get using this. Get some really high quality coffee beans, grind'em at home, use about one and a half scoops into your paper filter (using a small Gevalia-type scoop), take about 3 minutes (or less) to slowly pour your boiling water over the coffee grounds and you'll have a truly satisfying cup of hot coffee, right up there with French Press quality of flavor, but hotter. I've used the same beans in my Krups Moka Brew and they tasted awful then made the coffee using this, and it made a really flavorful cup of coffee. Highly recommended you try this before spending beaucoups of dollars on the high-end coffee brewers. Of course, if you're serving/entertaining folks, you'll need your standard coffee brewer but for making great, restaurant-quality coffee one cup at at time, this is a nice little product to have.   
When I adopted a cat a couple of weeks ago, two of my good friends highly recommended Fresh Step Premium Clay Cat Litter. Here's why--This Fresh Step Premium Clay Cat Litter is excellent for your favorite kitty's litter box. The company states that it is very good at absorbing odors--and, by golly, it's TRUE! The odors are minimal at the very most and it is quite comfortable even for my rather sensitive cat. Moreover, I really like how the litter has the capacity to absorb and prevent odor causing bacteria in the litter before my cat even uses his litter box. That's a plus for any cat lover!If you have more than one cat the manufacturer does recommend, not surprisingly, that you use more cat litter in the box. Otherwise, if you have just one cat, two or three inches worth of this cat litter spread about evenly throughout the empty litter box will do fine. You should change the entire litter box once a week on average. (I change mine about twice a week just for my cat's comfort.)It's also a good idea to scoop out any "kitty remains" every other day or so. Be very certain NOT to flush any "kitty presents" down the toilet as the manufacturer warns against this. I suppose it could clog toilet pipes. Moreover, as you may suspect, any "kitty leftovers" could have some nasty germs that we don't want so wash your hands really carefully after you clean the box or even after you just remove any "kitty presents" with a scooper.The fact that this is clay litter helps because you can use a very inexpensive litter scooper to remove any "kitty presents," thus reducing the number the times you need to change the entire kitty litter box. Nevertheless, I recommend changing the entire litter box at least once a week. Place the contents of the used litter box into a trash bag and discard as you would any other garbage.In short, this is a great cat litter product at a great price. The contents of the bag last a long time, especially if, like me, you have only one cat. The manufacturer also offers customers (us, not the cats) an "awards" program with points that you can accumulate in your "account" with the company on the company Internet website. A nice plus! OK, Fresh Step--I thank you; my father and mother thank you; and, most importantly, my CAT says THANK YOU !!!      SMILES
It's as absorbent as advertised and the color is much better than the photos
The high price is predominately due to the shipping costs as this magazine is produced in the United Kingdom.  A subscription over there runs about twenty bucks.  However, even with the added expense to get this delivered stateside, iCreate is a great looking magazine with excellent editorials.Top-notch magazine and highly recommended.  Just wish Imagine Publishing would recognize the potential of this product and start producing this, as-well-as a few other of their excellent magazines, here in the States
I LOVE THIS MAGAZINE! IT HAS UP TO THE MINUTE, NEED TO KNOW CELEB NEWS. HONESTLY MOST OF THE TIME WHAT THEY SAY IN THESE "TABLOID" MAGAZINES TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE- JESSICA SIMPSON SPLIT, AND BRAD AND ANGELINA, JEN AND VINCE, JUST TO NAME A FEW....ALSO THERE'S MOVIE/DVD/MUSIC REVIEWS, MAKEUP AND FASHION TIPS, AND THE CLOTHES THEY HAVE IN THERE ARE AFFORDABLE SO YOU CAN DRESS LIKE YOUR FAVORITE CELEB. I LOOK FORWARD TO EACH WEEK GETTING THIS MAGAZINE
Print magazines are behind current news by about 3-4 months. The websites have news about new digital cameras instantenously. The print magazines are destined to be 3-4 months behind. If you are looking for the latest news, you will get them tape-delayed if you only read magazines.However, this magazine goes more in depth than some other ...popular magazines. The reviews are actually 4-5 pages long, not one-page politically correct recaps of the feature lists. (Still nowhere near as technical as the web reviews).Having said all that, and understanding the limitations of print magazines, this is a good, affordable magazine to read if you are interested in digital photography. It has some useful and helpful information, reasonable reviews, and some interesting articles
Touchstone features articles, editorials, book reviews and other material from the perspective of Protestant (both mainline and evangelical), Catholic and Orthodox Christians who hold to traditional, orthodox understandings of Christian morality.  It tackles the tough issues of our time both in scholarly articles and practical advice for parents who must raise children to be faithful in a post-Christian culture.  While it does not seek a false ecumenicalism which demands unity at all cost (see the July/August 2003 issue on "Christian Unity & the Divisions we must Sustain"), it also recognizes that orthodox believers of all three major branches of Christianity must work together on moral issues on which we all agree.The publisher, the St. James Fellowship, also produces an excellent devotional guide: The St. James Daily Devotional Guide for the Christian Year, available by subscription though [...]
This magazine compares favorably to &quot;American Heritage&quot; with its interesting and accessible but well-researched accounts of the past. Each issue focuses on a person (I just read the story of Thomas Aquinas--and hadn't realized his fascinating interaction with Muslims) or a movement (The Huguenots, who's sad history led to their dispersal from France to all over the world--including the Revere family moving to Massachusetts). All in all, an intriguing glimpse at how Christians of the past continue to influence us today
From a subscription point of view (about $12/yr directly) this magazie is a decent value.  While half the information is fluff (looking back - 15 years of innovation, etc.) there is some timely relevant information hard to find easily in a consolidated way.  The focus is not just on laptops but mobile solutions - this includes peripherals, PDAs, mobile phones among others.  There is some opinion (RIAA vs Sirius) but the focus seems to be vendor/advertiser driven.For example, the cover story of the Mar 2006 issue is on First Four Core Duo notebooks.  They review Centrino Duo notebooks from Acer, Dell, Gateway and HP.  They run benchmark tests and provide charts, etc.  Fairly useful info.  Except they don't give the information consistently.  The weight of Dell laptop is not even mentioned while those of others is.  They do mention a few cons for each notebook but do it gently without a strong opinion. Two of the four systems reviewed are selected as Editors' Choice. The other two still are rated well.   There is no single table that compares them all in a single view.  You get the feeling, they were trying to please the advertisers and avoided any direct head-on comparision between multiple products.I disagree with their choices as well.  How could the Editors' choice be a 6.6lbs laptop from Acer that has an average battery life just because it offers some value?In the same Mar 2006, there is a review of Windows Treo 700W; a showdown between slim   phones Moto RAZR V3c and Samsung MM-A900; a short test of Nokia's pocket Internet Appliance and Kodak's first dual-lens digicam; Wifi routers; list of restaurants for business  travelers;   etc.For a $1/month, I recommend this to anyone who travels a lot and is looking for a quick update on the mobile computing world.  If you want in-depth technical info, stick to Toms Hardware or other web sites
An outstanding magazine even if all you wish to do is look at the pictures.  Great ideas and for a great price
Long time MSL subscriber.  I get out my dec, dec/jan issues every holiday season to see what works for ornaments and decorations and such.  I loved the cookie issue last year, definite keeper.  Her projects involve time and materials, but you end up with something that will last, and instructions are generally very clear.  I've seen that since her trial/jail, the high end advertisors have almost entirely backed out, which means adds for average joes, like me.  I really appreciate the depth that the mag goes into a certain subject, even if its not a particular fave of mine. I haven't really watched the Martha show much, I really enjoyed the original MSL show she started with.  Sometimes I get annoyed that the materials seem very exclusive to New York and similiar, but c'est la vie
Most newsmagazines are dumbed down in both intellectual rigor and political bite.  This is the only weekly newsmag I can stand to read, and I love to read it.  US news is a grab bag of topics, international is excellent (vs. other US sources of news), finance & business is excellent, science is a grab bag, books & arts is quite good, and the periodic special reports are great.  Cheeky and clear, a delight to read.  Bring your skepticism, though, because the reporters & columnists are not shy about taking a position, and you have to be ready to grapple and form your own opinion. 
EQMM is definitely a worthwhile magazine for any true fan of mysteries.  Is every story exceptional, of course not and that's unrealistic to expect it to be.  The stories are however entertaining and you get the opportunity to see something from some of your favorite writers.  I think it's enjoyable to read a short story from writers you like whether it is a surefire classic or just another tale.  To address, some of the issues by the jaded first reviewer, look at it from the standpoint of a mystery lover.  If the publishers only produced great classic books, we would have only a handful of books each year, instead of the masses that readers have the fun of combing thru each year. The pages smudge, but this is not a magazine that is mass produced like People or Time or Sports Illustrated.  At the current price, you could probably only get one to two stories a month for glossy pages.  If you're reluctant to get a subscription then at least go to your local bookstore and buy the latest copy of EQMM and find out for yourself how enjoyable getting a quick glimpse into dozen of mystery writers can be
Most magazimes half of their pages is advertizmet, this one have something to say and did make me some money when i used their top 10 stock picks for next year, that was January 99, the semiconductor boom, all 10 out of 10
my son had been wanting a suscription to a gamers mag and going off of the reviews i ordered this one and he thinks its great. he is 13 if you are interested
Jeff Goldblum's character in "The Big Chill" said that he couldn't write an article longer than the average person could read during a, er, "trip to the library" (wink, wink, nudge, nudge, know what I mean?). The writers at Details seems to have the same marching orders. In these hectic times, maybe that's not so bad. The articles I have read are well researched and nicely bite-sized.  I actually finished the entire magazine between PM mail delivery and breakfast the next day. The topics they covered in my first issue ranged from fashion to health concerns. And, again, they cover the topics in very few, well-written pages. I do think the models look like under-fed children but at my age, that could be tunnel-vision (grey hair, I remember Filmore East, you get the picture?). My suggestion, take a look. It's a magazine with an interesting voice and it may be for you.      
If you're like me - middle-aged, white, male, conservative, Christian, who buys most of my clothes at Old Navy - you will be the target of all the condescending ridicule in every article.  And yet I find it very entertaining!  Although I'll never be able to afford even one of their recommended outfits, and I'm usually a full 180 degrees opposite of their political views, I find their articles interesting, well-written, and insightful.  I must admit, I should hate Esquire, because the editors and writers would find me disgusting.  But somehow I look forward to seeing it in my mailbox every month.  The writers, if nothing else, are intelligent, which is more than I can say for the writers in most guy magazines like FHM and Maxim
I actually make the recipes in this magazine. The recipes are simple but interesting.  The nutritional information is also great.  This is my favorite cooking magazine by far
I have been reading this magazine for years.  I love the tips and enjoy looking at what is "fashionable" at the time.  I recommend this magazine!
This magazine is totally awesome. from the excellent software on the disk, to the FREAKIN-AWESOME reviews, to the silly humor and funny letters on the back pages, this magazine is for any mac user who want's more than the professional MacWorld can giveProjecting humor into a computer magazine is not something many editors can do, bu Rik Myslewski (spelling?) does a great job. I totally recommend it
As an author I find Oprah's magazine to be the most inspirational any human being could use to start their month.  "Divorcing a wife because you can not be all she needs is a very loving act.  Everyone deserves intimacy-emotional and physical.  If a gay or bisexual man loves his wife, her happiness will be more important to him than his own.  Setting her free to allow her the opportunity to be loved as she deserves to be, is the ultimate expression of love." Dennis J. Schleicher
I have been a subscriber for years and have grudgingly paid more and more every year for my subscription.  Still I have always loved PW and look forward to my weekly edition...although I do not always receive my magazine in a timely manner. Whether because I live on the West Coast or if it's just the mail, I don't know.  Sometimes it arrives way into the following week, sometimes closer to the beginning of the week.  I still find the magazine valuable, but have to say the following:For a magazine directed at the publishing trade I find it ludicrous that there are so many typos in the reviews as well as the text. WHO IS DOING THE PROOF READING HERE?  There is a new format that has updated the look, but I miss the best seller lists being in the back of the magazine.  Now they're somewhat in the middle and one definitely can't just easily flip to them.  Also, the Q&A's with authors are so stupidly placed in issues which don't contain the review of the author's book who is being interviewed.  Instead, there is a reference date to the issue said book was reviewed in. It's frustrating to read the Q&A and then not be able to see the review of the author's book in the same issue.  I guess the publisher thinks people keep the magazine at least 4 weeks or issues just lie around the house or office and pile up.  I like the "Deals" columm and "Hollywood Reader" column, but my very favorite section is the Author Profile.  I am curious tho about the age of some of the writers in this publication... I'd also like to know how the magazine and the editors decide what book should get a starred review.  Sometimes I'm astounded as to what gets starred.  The website, which you get full access to when you register as a subscriber to the magazine, is easy to use.  Even before I receive my issue in the mail, I can see the latest issue on line
I actually really love this magazine. The articles are down to earth and helpful...not cheesy and shallow, like those found in Cosmo. The editorial staff of Lucky seems to really relate to real women and aren't "bitchy and pretentious," like other women's magazines
So often when looking through magazines I haven't found quite what I was looking for in the Christian literature.  I like the approach Christianity Today takes.  It has articles that are broad, and not focused on a specific demonination.  I believe the magazine has a slight evangelical bent to it.   I do like the variety of articles, and coverage of current events.  I would recommend this magazine for those who want to become a little more informed of Christianity in the modern world
THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS is published 20 times a year, biweekly except in January, July, August and September. It is a respected publication which is devoted mostly to reviews of current books and an occasional movie. It also contains articles of social or political interest. The Letters section is usually brief with little waste.Contributors to a recent edition included Mark Danner, Sister Helen Prejean and Daniel Mendelsohn. Reviews covered such diverse items as a collection of short stories by Graham Greene and two books about the actress Anna May Wong in addition to ALEXANDER, a film directed by Oliver Stone.THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS consistently offers provocative writing in a highly readable style. It definitely deserves its reputation for excellence
This mag has its ups and downs but there is no other magazine with more class and originality. It's an icon all over the world. The editor has inspired books and movies for her perfectionism and professionalism. She and Vogue have gone a long way toward making women strong and independent. Without Vogue magazine fashion would not be a multi-billion dollar industry
I enjoyed this magazine as a kid, but then, I also loved Electric Company.  Looking at both now, they seem dated and tedious, but perhaps our children need something that moves at a slower pace than everything seems to do now. Neither of my children (5 & 7) enjoyed Highlights at first, but after getting a subscription from their grandmother, they have discovered the joy of curling up in a quiet corner and figuring out the puzzles and stories for themselves.  It's a magazine with a style and format that encourages reflection and absorption, rather than a voracious grab and go version of reading, that I believe will give a child a better foundation.  "To read without reflection is like eating without digesting" Edmund Burk
When the Armchair Detective stopped being published, I was without a good mystery magazine. I received a complimentary copy of Mystery Scene and I subscribed to it. The magazine is published 5 times per year and features great interviews and good book reviews. I especially enjoy their reviewing lesser known authors and books by independent publishers. My favorite part is the "Where Are They Now" which features authors who  seem to have stopped writing a particular series, many of whom I have read in the past. An excellent publication
For $10 a year, at least I can look at a magazine that isn't dominated by SpongeBrand Squarepants or Dora the Commercialized Explorer and that realizes not every parent thinks the Disney Princess pastel hegemony is the only way to go for a nursery.  Will I pay $200 for a sweater?  Very doubtful, but if I did it would be something I could pass down as an heirloom.  True, I may spend more per item on my daughter's clothes and toys than most, but I also limit the number of things she does receive.  I'd rather spend $100 on one unique toy I found in Cookie than give her twenty pieces of plastic at $5 a pop from some toy megapolis.  Cookie covers quality over quantity, style over branding, modern over mainstream and for that I'm grateful
Having been a BW subscriber for more than two years, I found BW is one of the best business magazines in the US. It is funny to see some readers accused BW to be biased. Granted, BW criticized many policies of current administration, because they were against long-term growth of the economy. Some of them were pure political manipulations such as steel tariff, those policies will do no one's good.Business is business, for those party-faithfuls who spring to defense anytime their party being criticized regardless the causes, they don't need to read anything intelligent and balanced, Fox News will be suffecient
I have gone through my latest copy twice of this magazine. The interesting articles and letters make you feel like you are part of a community, not just a crazy cat person. I like the extensive breeder listing in the back, whether or not I ever will get a pure bred cat.
As a straight female I offer a unique perspective on this magazine.  I think it's totally hot.  I really like the fiction, and the guys are such cute young hotties!  Some of them look a little "mean" for my taste - they look so challengingly at you, instead of invitingly, but then again, a lot of guys in porn look this way to me - this is normal for porn I guess.  Very few, if any of them are over-beefed (too muscular), and some of them aren't muscular at all, which means nice variety.  The fiction is my favorite of all the gay mags I've looked at - lots of first times, nothing really bizarre or violent.  Overall a cool magazine
Alrightly. Folks it doesn't get any better than this. This magazine blends humor with serious reviewing. They will give the strong points and bad while keeping it real to the hardcore player elite - like me! Anyhow, I've read this magazine for a while and I've never been disappointed. The "Ask the 800 lbs. Gorilla" section is a riot. The Bottomline gamer this is an unbiased, not corporatly owned (like OPM, and XBOX magazine) and a pleasing magazine to read. Anyone "hooked" on gaming and looking for great recommendations on must have games should pick up a PSM and get a subscription.   
I wish I could give this magazine 6 stars.  Finally, an honest magazine for Christians.  I am the target demographic, so I understand the style does not appeal to all, but the content can easily relate to anyone who is willing to get past their pre-concieved religious notions and desire Biblical truth.  I sometimes get sick of the 'relevant' move because it frequently becomes used as an excuse for Christians to abuse their freedom as believers, but Relevant does a fantastic job of giving a balanced look at relevant faith.  I don't always agree with every article, but I appreciate the open, honest, and sometimes opposing views.  It is not a one-sided, or single minded publication.  I wish I could afford to get a subscription for all the Christians I know
I picked up a copy of Spirituality & Health a couple of years ago at a bookstore and sent in the subscription card right away.  This magazine is wonderful if you're looking for a magazine devoted to putting a spiritual perspective on life.  This magazine covers everything; mind, body, and spirit, the total package.  In the back there are also listings of upcoming events that the spiritually inclined may be interested in.  I highly recommend this magazine, as I always catch myself saying to someone, "I just read this awesome article in Spirituality & Health...
Love this magazine! Just wish it came out more often. Great for more than those with farms or homesteads. Articles on gardening, building projects, animals. Buy It
"Discipleship Journal" does what many other Christian magazines do not do. It provides instruction, and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a Christ-focused faith. While others may talk about Christianity, DJ asks you to pursue Christ through responding to Scripture.This isn't an evangelistic magazine, like "Decision," or an encouraging magazine, per se, like "Moody." It is for the Christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what God's word says.It is not for the passive pew sitter. This for the Christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between Sundays.There is nothing watered-down here. It is published by NavPress, who, like their counterparts, the college ministry Navigators, know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday Christian. Whether it is a discussion about Satan's favorite lies, how to study a particular book of the Bible, or an explanation of what prayer is an is not, DJ is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid-page and realize something new about our Lord and his ways.This is a great tool for two or three people to use together. Even a small group... to go through the articles, week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life. I've even heard of CCD and Sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week's class.I fully recommend "Discipleship Journal." Expect your faith to grow.Anthony Trendl editor, HungarianBookstore.co
This magazine is one of my nightly treats! I take it with me to bed and read it until I fell asleep, dreaming about the vacations awaiting me.This great magazine covers just anywhere in the world. I have learnt a lot about travelling. I even love it's advertisements(the vacation packages)
You can tell a lot about the readership a men's magazine is trying to reach by scanning the first three car ads. In the issue in front of me, they flog the Lincoln MKZ, Range Rover Sport, and Audi A6.There you have it. We're going for the affluent but not super-rich young guy who won't even become aware that the Lincoln Town Car and Audi A8 exist until he turns 55.  Well, 52 maybe.But you didn't need the cars to figure out MEN'S HEALTH.It's about what all men think about and what affluent guys with six-pack abs (in reality or in their dreams) can generally snag: expensive suits, beautiful women who seem never not to pout, and beefy arms to set off those abs.To be fair, there is actually a fair amount of *health* under discussion in these pages. But I doubt that's the main reason guys pull this magazine off the shelf instead of, say, DOG FANCIERS.In spite of an irritating habit of treating women as trophies to be won or dupes to be lured, there is a good bit of wit in here about what one might call the manly dilemma in the modern world. And if it really is lack of *just* the right workout regimen that has kept you from getting all that's on offer in MEN'S WORLD, where there's at least one new workout each month that will cure all that ails you.Don't mistake this monthly for serious journalism. But you won't need a brown paper bag to carry it out of the store either.I kind of like it
OK, the advertisements are a bit much, but the magazine is great. My son has subscriptions to Cricket and Kids Discover, too. He has had many other magazine subscriptions over the years, and this one stands out to me because, unprompted, he has always found fun information that he felt was worth sharing. This magazine was also a favorite with my niece who does not like to read at all. The magazine format is easy to read, yet rich in content
After reading a few of the other reviews, I am again baffled by the left/liberal take on things.  This is a CONSERVATIVE magazine!!  Liberals, open at your own risk!  You just MIGHT encounter a differing view point than you own!  Goodness.  The articles are informative, indepth, humorous, and thoughtful.  It's a good read. 
a front page title: is your health making you fat? it was related to some kind of hormones that causes a series of symptoms and make a woman to gain weight waist up
I like this magazine and I subscribe to it (along with Cooking for Two and Cook's Country), but I don't think it's perfect.  I like when the magazine offers a several-page article with a formula for pasta salad or muffins, so I can make whatever flavor I choose and know it will turn out well.  But the magazine does contain ads, despite what one reviewer claimed
My 4ish daughter LOVES this magazine, as do we. Each issue gets pretty tattered while she waits for the next issue.Educational (for all of us) and entertaining.  She remembers the information given to her in the short and concise articles and enjoys testing us to see if we were paying attention.A keeper for sure
After subscribing to Natural Health for years, the magazine recently &quot;went to the dogs&quot;. I now subscribe to Alternative Medicine instead and it is like Natural Health USED to be. I love it. The information is accurate and the topics are all very interesting
What I like about this magazine is that the articles are unique and informative.  I have bought the last three issues and can't wait for the next one.   This magazine covers equipment in a current mode rather than a 6 months to a year behind style so familiar with many of the other photography magazines.  This magazine provides me some much needed diversion because it captures my attention each time I have picked one up.  Every article is telling me about or showing me how to implement the lastest techniques from the best photographers in the industry.  At the beginning of this year I noticed  that some of the  "popular" or "modern"  "digital review" magazines were running the same old head to head comparisons of  consumer cameras that have been out for the better part of a year now. I need to see the technology  that is cutting edge or even around the corner.  So far this magazine is giving me the best bang for my buck.Good luck
As a straight female I offer a unique perspective on this magazine.  I think it's totally hot.  I really like the fiction, and the guys are such cute young hotties!  Some of them look a little "mean" for my taste - they look so challengingly at you, instead of invitingly, but then again, a lot of guys in porn look this way to me - this is normal for porn I guess.  Very few, if any of them are over-beefed (too muscular), and some of them aren't muscular at all, which means nice variety.  The fiction is my favorite of all the gay mags I've looked at - lots of first times, nothing really bizarre or violent.  Overall a cool magazine
Maxim is a good magazines for adult males.  I enjoy all articles and their website, too.  It is more affordable subscrition
I've received The Whole Dog Journal for the past year.  I have found it to be refreshing as it has no advertisements.  It's pure holistic news, information, health, nutrition, training, food testing, and anything else pertaining to DOGS!  I would recommend this magazine to new dog owners as well as seasoned.  One thing about the world of dogs is that it is ever changing.  It's not always easy to get information that is up-to-date, helpful, and necessary.  With The Whole Dog Journal one can be certain that they will have the best knowledge
I have been subscribing to this mag for a couple years, and think it's one of the best gaming mags available.  I have several different consoles, and appreciate that they review games for all platforms.  I like the rating system (1-10) instead of the too-hard-to-pin-down 1-5, and find the reviews well written and objective.  While I have been gaming for years, I am not necessarily versed in computer lingo, but I never feel like an idiot after reading this mag; the writing is erudite but very easy to understand.  I read several different gaming magazines each month, and feel this magazine strikes exactly the right balance between the more serious and more frivolous gaming magazines in the industry.One suggestion: if you have a GameStop or affiliated store in your neighborhood, get your subscription through them.  For about $15 you receive a 12-year subscription, and a card that gives you 10% off used games at these stores, as well as an extra 10% trade-in value on your used games (sometimes there will be a coupon in that month's mag to upgrade to 20% for both!).
GQ, A.K.A Gentlemen's Quarterly is a men's magazine like Cosmopolitan is to women.  GQ has a broad range of contents in it's magazine from: in-depth articles from movie and rock stars, fashion, food and drink, technology, movies, music, etc.  The magazine gives equal attention to all the contents except fashion which is more abundant throughout the magazines pages.  All in all, GQ is a great men's magazine with plenty of fashion news/tips, and also delves in other men's interests as stated above
This is a light and colorful newspaper. I remember when it first came out .The idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the United States as a whole. It does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country. The reporting itself is clear and very readable.The paper lacks weight and depth. It has a lot of variety in its features, and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable.It's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting. And there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers.
Forget about shop etc... Lucky is the best shopping mag by far. I got alot of coupons for full size products an, samples inside of Lucky magazine. I love me some free samples! I am from NYC and you have to know what's wearing and all, so this mag let me know a whole lot about fashion, makeup, hair produts, house wares etc
This is not my favorite fitness magazine.  This is the size of a Reader's Digest, but is packed with ads just like a Beauty Magazine.  I find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover.  They share reasonable and attainable goals, and suggestions for us normal people.  The magazine seems to cover a wide age group, with information that is good for both young and old.  They do offer recipes, workout suggestions, and much more.  The magazine takes little time to read, and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy.  I think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase
I have been a subscriber of Shop Etc. since its debut, when I heard that they were going to publish a magazine for familes I ran to subscribe and I have not been disapointed yet!  I love it
This was for my friend in jail.I believe he said that he's enjoying i
I remember when this magazine was the lone Conservative voice on the newstands. I too have memories of many long Latinate sentences which Mr.Buckley provided and I had to try and figure out. It is not that I always agreed, much less understood him. But I did feel that he was a man walking to the sound of his own drummer, who had a real concern for public life in America, and his own ideas of how to make it better.I also saw through the years that he edited a very intelligent opinion- journal which explored many aspects of American reality.The magazine today seems to me still to be of high- quality, though Mr. Buckley is no longer at the helm. 
After been loaned this issue of June 2004, by a committed, reallygenuine Episcopalian, I was greatly impressed! These creative, unique articles captured my Imagination: "What is Power?" by Sam Keen; "Taking the First Step" by Anna Lappe`; "Accessing Sacred Energy," by Judith Orloff, MD; "The Making of a Chaplain" By Karen O'Brien (So like the pages of my earlier Verbatim in CPE). "The Best Spiritual Books" are reviews of 50 out of 300 books by Fred and Mary Ann Brussat! We surely agreed on the first few named: "The Heart of Christianity" Marcus Borg; "Beyond Belief" Elaine Pagels; "The Wisdom Way of Knowing" Cynthia Bourgeault; ++"The Lord is My Shepherd" Rabbi Kushner+ "The Power of Patience" by M J Ryan!  I am still in the whirlwind of those emotionally stimulating, artistically written articles on varied yet potent topics of food for Thought and Reflection. Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood 
InStyle magazine takes its readers into the lives of celebrities and makes them accessible. The features are very informative and fun. I enjoy the Man of Style feature and the Entertaining guide best! For more on mags, visit my blog at magazinediva.typepad.com
"The Economist" is a great weekly magazine with in-depth, balanced and enlightening journalism. The articles are largely expertly written by knowledgeable people.The writing in "The Economist" is interesting and insightful with articles conveying detailed and yet condensed information. The magazine has contributions from senior people from all over the world, making it interesting and relevant to a worldwide readership.The editors and journalists of the Economist need to be applauded for the broad range of well-written articles with balanced analysis every week. Reading this magazine ensures that I know what is happening worldwide every week, although I do not always agree with some positions the magazine takes.This is recommended reading for business leaders and decision makers who require a diverse range of views and information about what is happening at different places in the world on subjects as diverse as politics, current affairs, science and technology, national, regional and global issues, finance, trade, and development. Even Great People like Nelson Mandela relied on this magazine for news during his long years in prison.
to the defunct and much missed Armchair Detective magazine. Comparisons aside, Strand is the BEST of a large group that range from glossy to fanzines & newsletters covering the mystery genre. VERY ENJOYABLE!! And don't sell some of them short either!John Rowin1ea
A real favorite in this magazine is the page of quotes, It is sure to bring a smile or teach you something about life. They also always have cleaning tips, health topics, diet and exercise solutions, true stories, beauty hints, inspirational articles, soul nourishing tips, recipes, recipes and more recipes, family/children, flowers, end of the magazine article to make you think about life, and gardening hints. If you want to find a cover story fast, they have an "on our cover" section in the index. In Every Issue there is a shopper's guide and a recipe index. The articles are helpful and in the March 2002 issue they had an article on how to be less stressed. They also had an article on PCOS which is apparently more common than we women think. The beauty sections show you the newest fashion and you can decide if you want to adapt your style to the trends. Always seems rather chic. Some of the recipes in the March 2002 issue included:A luscious Lemon Coconut Pound CakeCoconut MacaroonsPeanut Butter Oat BarsBaby Cheesecakes - really cute Banana SalsaFrench Oven Beef StewPasta with ShrimpThe recipes are not difficult and seem practical. Even the advertising in this magazine is colorful and fun. A Very "American Gal" type magazine. Nothing fancy, just real life.~TheRebeccaReview.com 
I greatly enjoyed reading this magazine in years past. However, I have not received anything yet from my Amazon.com order. I am eagerly waiting for my subscription to start!!
I love Entertainment Weekly.  This is a magazine that has everything current...outline of plot, reviews for movies, music, tv, dvds, books.  It keeps you current.  It is the one magazine that I go through from cover to cover
This is a fun read.  The articles are entertaining and short.  Good to pass some time.  Excellent for the plane!
This is the ultimate magazine for mystery readers and mystery writers. From front cover to back, it's full of the information you need to know about new books, favorite authors, and what's going on in the mystery business
I stumbled across this little gem almost by accident, and what a surprise it was.  The sheer breadth of subject matter could span half a lifetime.  We never forget the lessons of our youth, and each issue, like a great short story, will separate you from the mundane and transform the way you view literature.   And yes, you will return...time and time again. Are you trying to decide whether to devote your summer to reading Anna Karenina?  Perhaps it will ignite in you a love for the Great Russian novels, providing fodder that, like all firm foundations, could change the course of your life.  If it's the modern classics that you're interested in, one almost can't help but think along the lines of John Knowles.  Life marches on, and we choose whether to change or be changed.  Much is out of our control in this world, but what we choose to read is not. Regardless of your personal paradigm, you will find much of interest in this cleverly constructed work.   While the idea of a Holiday gift might seem obvious, why not consider surprising and old friend with a subscription? Does your friend really need that Springsteen coffee table tome?  Even as a belated wedding gift, it would no doubt be appreciated.  Don't stand around in bookstores, Starbucks in hand, flipping through page after page anymore...Oh, you don't do that, huh?  No, neither do I.  Just subscribe now.  I hope to find one in my mailbox soon.-Timothy McPhail, Avondale Estates, GA
FHM is absolutely gorgeous! hot and sexy covers, great entertainment and fashion info.Men lifestyle is discussed in this magazine. Make sure that you subscribe yearly to save up cost
OK. For those of you who continue to believe that New York is the center of the United States, Hell, the world, who forgot the map CNN kept flashing with the two different colors after the election that MIGHT infer there are several schools of thought about the polycentric views of the US, for those of you who can take a little criticism from the midwest, the dark states, middle earth, the Elba of the 21st century, you're not.There's a whole world out here. People have jobs. Yes, it's true. We work, send our kids to school, even go to church on Sundays. And on other days too. We vote. Oh, yeah, you already know that.So having an interview with an actor who goes on about how he meditates, is a vegan and thinks about trees and birds when he has a particularly stressful scene with Ashley or Uma or Diane, you know, it just doesn't carry a lot of weight with the serfs. But . . . .It's a great magazine. Andy lives. Photography is tight and realistic. The ads are sexy and provocative. The sidebars interesting and insightful. It's wordly. It covers music as well as RS. It's (don't get all riled up now) a fun magazine to read. However, the interviews which we are led to believe are the heart and soul of the magazine, seem to be along the lines of 'damn, it's so good to be me and I guess you're OK too.' Or, 'I see you're wearing a $15,000 Versace with a plunging neckline and . . . you've selected old, black, Converse All Stars to wear with it! How Noveau! How tasteful!'Come on. Where's the bite? Where's the interview with Alex Rodriguez that says 'how come you went to therapy . . . it's only New York?' or with Marv Alpert 'hey what's on your fashion agenda now?'Chris Berman from ESPN says he was on Maui a couple of years back and he was walking with his kids one dawn and he ran into Steven Stills with his kids. Now that's a conversation I would have liked to hear, not one that ends up with me thinking the two parties to the conversation (it sure isn't an interview - see Columbia University's Interviewing 101 in their School of Journalism) are off to pick out furniture.It's New York. Show your teeth. Flex. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
There are a few magazines about writing serious writers need to read. "Poets & Writers" is one of them. It has a literary bent, but avoids the nose-in-the-air attitude. It is practical and educational, and is pleasingly presented.A favorite factor for me are the long feature articles on the culture of writing. In the issue out now, there are two major articles. One is about author Stuart Dybek and his fiction that pulls from his experience growing up on Chicago's colorful South Side. The other is about writing contests, dealing with how ethical they are run, the view of literary judges, and when a writer should considering entering one.The secondary articles are as informative and as useful, whether you want to learn about promoting your book, doing online workshops or understand the trends driving the industry.Contests, incidentally, are a big part of PW's value. The magazine tells you who won, and which contests/grants are currently accepting submissions. PW is careful to screen which contests are listed, ensuring only legitimate ones make it through the editors.The writing itself is interesting. It is not always true that writing magazines are fun to read. It should be, and in the case of PW, everything is engaging.PW's design is clean. It looks like what a small press literary magazine should look like. The typography and layout are not pretentious or overbearing, but get the job done. It is never work to read this magazine.I fully recommend "Poets & Writers." You will be better informed about writing and writers, just like the titles implies.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.co
As with any profession or avocation or just down right fun habit, it is only as good as the tools you use. This magazine helps you keep up with the latest in the knitting world while still offering traditional patterns and methods.There are lots of glossy shots of fibers and models with well defined patterns and suggestions. You can find many great ads and reviews of other reading material.
A must-have for all info junkies. From the bizarre to the informative, the diligent crew at mental_floss never ceases to dredge up something interesting.  Be the life of the cocktail party, be a mental_flosser
The London Review of Books is, without a doubt the best literary journal in the world: at the same time erudite, entertaining and informative, each issue is a foray into a world of knowledge that is all too lacking in other publications and media. There was a time in my life when I couldn't afford to put my heating on in the bitterly cold British winter, but I never thought to cancel my subscription to the LROB. Highly recommended
My students love getting a chance to read on current topics they are interested in
 When I bought PC World at a store, the cover looked appealing. It had an advice on how to surf the Internet trouble free. So I brought it home and started reading it. I was amazed! I have never read a magazine cover to cover before, but I read this one word for word. This mag is filled with tons of reviews of best software and new gadgets. It also has unbiased articles written in a balanced simple English and technical language on computing in general. Perhaps the best part about the magazine is the CD they include with it. iT is filled with PC World recommended software that will make your life much easier. IF you never heard of PC World, you don't know what you're missing. Go to the nearest store and ask for the copy. You'll be glad you di
This magazine if full of fun fashion items! It shows you some great ideas of how to do things for the upcoming year! Its a definite go!!:
I admit it; I'm addicted ... not to the heavy stuff, but instead head-over-heels in love with audiobooks.  And they have found a friend in AudioFile, a truly wonderful magazine that informs addicts like me about the latest trends, equipment, books to hit the market. The down is that it's only published every other month.  I voraciously read it both on line and the "hardcover" edition that arrives in my mailbox.  Some other reviewer complains that the reviews are nothing more than recaps.  While they are short and to the point, I disagree about the contents of the reviews.  They're exactly what I'm looking for: an overview of the book, not an in-detail New York TImes type review.  If I want to learn more I then check with Amazon to see what others feel.  While I still purchase and read print books (they'll never go out of style!), I have found audiobooks a great alternative to curling up with Agatha Christie.  And, hopefully, AudioFile, along with my newfound addiction to audiobooks, will continue to prosper and grow.  It's good to be in on the ground floor
When funds were tight I had a difficult time deciding which magazine subscriptions to keep.  Each women's magazine has a slightly different feel in the writing, though with increased competition, these styles seem to be in flux.  I finally decided that I  preferred the writing in Bazaar and was getting tired of what I felt was Vogue's Cosmopolitan attempt to catch a larger readership (if I want to subscribe to Cosmo, I'll bloody well subscribe).  The featured designers are more cutting edge and less mainstream than what is found in Vogue.  It's a bit snottier (though there are far snottier magazines if you are looking for extreme fashions).  Among my complaints: Bazaar is an obviously thinner magazine, and while most of Vogue's content is adverts, it does seem to have more articles.  Another item that I find highly irritating, is Bazaar's society items.  I really don't give a ---- who is wearing what at what charity gala, especially when I don't play footsies with these people.  Those complaints aside, this is still my favorite fashion magazine
I first picked up a copy of Nylon in Chicago, while browsing the newsstands. I wasn't sure if I would like it--years of subscribing to Vogue, Elle, and some stupid tweeny magazines had almost put me off magazine-reading for good. And yet I always manage to be drawn to the racks.Nylon was different from the get go. They always feature unknowns on the cover, and when, on occassion, a well-known celebrity is featured, the stories give us a new perspective on them. Nylon is worth purchasing for the layout in itself. I could spend hours paging through each feature, marveling at the graphics, and the way the magazine is put together. I love how they base some of the beauty section on famous movies or bands.Nylon also makes a point of covering bands, movies, and fashion designers that, until now, have remained obscure. Everything they feature is amazing--most of the music they recommend ends up on my Amazon wishlist!I would highly recommend Nylon to anyone and everyone. This obscure magazine will stun you with its amazing artistic layout, and introduce you to new products you may have never discovered
CEMETERY DANCE magazine is a World Fantasy Award winning magazine of horror, published bi-monthly, featuring short stories of horror and dark suspense, interviews with outstanding talent, and reviews galore. There is no shortage of opinions where products are concerned, with somewhere around forty-five reviews in every issue, including articles by writers Bev Vincent, Michael Marano, Thomas F. Monteleone, Paula Guran, Steve Vernon, John Pelan, Hank Wagner, Rick Kleffel, William P. Simmons, the list goes on and on. Writer Robert Morrish is the editor, Mindy Jarusek the managing editor.The publisher and executive editor is Richard Chizmar, who has edited and published some chilling anthologies under the titles SHIVERS I, II, III, and IV, featuring tales by top names in the genre, top names who know a thing or two about scaring people. CEMETERY DANCE magazine not only inspires "the creeps" in this reader, but also keeps me informed about new book releases, and other magazines in the genre. If you like your horror ranging anywhere from gonzo to literate, you will like CEMETERY DANCE magazine.
This is the best fashion magazine on the market.  Very realistic with budgets too.  It shows different ways in which everyone can be fashionable (on any budget).  I also enjoy the beauty articles because they have original ideas to stay in style and keep your skin looking beaufiful
I started a subscription for my granddaughter, now four, a couple years ago.  She loves animals, and loves Your Big Backyard.  Goes through it from cover to cover.  I'd highly recommend it. 
IF you have any interest in design, i recommend getting this mag, it has the latest trends in design as well as new products and designers
I've been a subscriber of E Magazine (which stands for The Environmental Magazine) for over a year now and I love it. It is, by far, the best environmentally oriented magazine I've come across. All of the ads are for environmentally-friendly companies and products, I now purchase products at at least 50% of the places advertised in this magazine. E Magazine covers topics all over the world, including global warming, horse meat (popular in Europe), whaling, deforestation, etc. If you are concerned or interested in environmental issues, I would highly recommend a subscription to this magazine. The issues are bi-monthly but are absolutely action-packed and fact-filled. Subscribe today
I have been a long time subscriber to Vogue Knitting, it was one of the few US knitting magazines that had really fashionable knitting patterns. I am from Germany, where there are lots of knitting magazines with really chic patterns, I missed that when I moved to the US. However, I find that the content in Vogue Knitting really fluctuated - sometimes it was packed with great designs, sometimes, it was just too far out and there wasn't a single pattern I wanted to knit. I stopped my subscription for a while. Then the editor changed and now the magazine is somewhere in the middle - not too funky, yet still chic and fun. I still enjoy reading it every once in a while. After having my daughter, I changed my subscription to Family Circle Easy Knitting, since Vogue Knitting does not carry any patterns for babies or kids, which I really find a shame. I even wrote a letter to the editor saying that this was a major omission. Especially because it is very hard to find chic and elegant kids knits in magazines - not those acrylic yarn patterns with bears on them! The German magazines do a great job of having some unique, but still fun kids designs. If you want a very trendy knitting magazine that uses a whole range of yarns (some very expensive), then Vogue Knitting is the magazine for you. If you are looking for elegant knits that are more functional, but still challenging, I would suggest Interweave Knits and Rebecca (English version of a German magazine), both carry some really interesting and challenging patterns. If you have kids, there isn't much out there, I would suggest Family Circle Easy Knitting, also Rebecca does a kids issue once a year, which should not be missed
I love Eating Well!  I am an active Weight Watchers Member and was so disapointed in the Weight Watchers Magazine, then I saw Eating Well and subscribed immediately! It is the best food magazine out there and no ads
Wonderful cycling magazine for everyday riders.  The content is very well rounded covering racing, touring, commuting, recreational cycling, and mountain biking.  This magazine doesn't just focus on how to make you faster or how to get you to buy the newest/greatest/lightest $8000 carbon bike.  Most of the equipment the magazine tests is geared for regular folks who can afford reasonable prices.  The only problem I have is the price in the U.S
Imagine FX is by far the most detailed magazine that I have seen that is completely loyal and devoted to Scifi and Fantasy Digital Art. Whether your a technician or an admirer, this book oozez with talent and technique. The magazine is not a pro's only book and they take a hands on approach to helping amateurs. None of the writers seem full of themselves. They all know they are in a liquid world of a digital medium where everyone learns from everyone. I highly recommend this magazine. It's more than average price tag is worth every penny, especially when every magazine comes packaged with a disc choc-full of demos, tutorials, photoshop brushes and source art. There is no other experience that comes near the likes of Imagine FX
Beautifully done, Kids Discover issues are packed with information on one specific subject (ie: volcanoes, the Civil War...). My daughter is 8 and a good student. She uses these magazines as reference texts more than as casual reading material. I think these magazines would be enjoyed most by parents and students between the ages of 10 to 14.
I began reading The Green Guide about a year ago and it's one of the best resources out there.  They cover a wide variety of topics and offer actual steps you can take towards a "greener," healthier life.  One of my favorite issues is the one about which ingredients to avoid in cosmetics. Also, I just bought a house and their issue one eco-renovation is extremely helpful.  Not only do they tell you which products are safest, but they also list places where you can actually purchase them!  Their website, [. . .] also has a ton of great information, including charts on which fish, beef, chicken and eggs are safest to buy. I printed them out and carry them with me whenever I go to the supermarket or restaurants
At least as far as the magazine itself is concerned, but Cardplayer is a vastly superior website with up to the minute tournament coverage, email, and a ton of other things. All In online is definitely worth checking out on a regular basis, however. I just read two hardcopy issues when I was in Vegas and I liked the features, pro coverage, interviews, and book reviews. Should you be miles from a nearby cardroom and have a jones to advance your knowledge then you can do so rather passively by reading a publication that closely follows the pro game
I have loved the magazine for years and decided it would be smarter to subscribe. The first issue came a month earlier than I expected in perfect condition. This was a wonderful buying experience
I love this magizine and I have read every issue.  It has great fitness tips for you whole body.  I would definately recomend this magizine to you
From fitting pants to making origami pants, there is always something for the sewer to learn and enjoy. Threads used to have good knitting articles, but decided to abandon the subject to concentrate on sewing. If you are a fashion sewer, this is a must-have
the perfect bite-sized science news to keep up to date on interesting new developments - just the right length for a weekly
Agree with the other reviewer, nothing like this in the states. No country kitch, no traditional, just straight modern, clean, pretty rooms/homes. It's expensive, that's the part that stinks. I buy it at $7.50 an issue, but it's worth it. B/c it's modern, there is a lot of minimalism, which you very rarely see in U.S. magazines. I keep every copy of this. They are always good for reference, i read them each dozens of times over.
Fortune is the best business magazine I've ever read.  The articles are insightful and well-written--informative without being dry
I got Cricket magazine in the mail when I was young. Years later, it has lost none of its quality. It's full of stories, articles, cartoons, jokes, puzzles. I remember some of the stories to this day. The text is always fun, always informative, never condescending. Difficult words are defined, complex ideas are explained, and the reader is enchanted. The illustrations are beautiful, from many different styles. The stories are from the best writers for children, and they cover all manner of cultures and interests. I can't recommend this magazine highly enough
This wonderful magazine made me a good cook. Period. Each issue considers upcoming holidays plus what fruits and veggies are in season and provides a ton of new recipes. My family never knows that the recipes are light and I'm actually somewhat happy about sitting down and planning out meals. The recipes are also a mix of complicated and simple, fruit and desert, main dishes and salads. I buy subscriptions as gifts. Plus, there's not one iota of advertising in this beautifully photographed magazine. Refreshing! Mary in P
I finally subscribed to Glamour after buying it every month at the grocery store, each time saying it would be the last time I bought this "vapid silly thing." What can I say? It's addictive. We can't read the Economist all the time now, can we
I love evo and buy it every month.  So why don't I get a subscription?  Because it still costs less to buy it at Barnes and Noble than to get a 12 month subscription!  This must be the only magazine that can claim a cheaper in-store price.  What's up with that
This is one of the bibles for anyone in graphic design, advertising, illustration or photograhy. It digs deep into industry trends, features portfolios of upcoming industry stars, and is a must for anyone who takes their craft seriously. While the issues are great, their Regional Design Annual is the must-buy issue every year. It really lets you know who the cream of the crop are. Just flipping through it will make you better at what you do (and you'll even stop using hackneyed phrases like &quot;cream of the crop&quot;)
The magazine is made exclusively for hardcore bodybuilders.  If you're into fitness, this magazine ain't for you.  However, if you're into BODYBUILDING - HARDCORE, then this is the magazine for you.  It is jam-packed with muscle upon muscle of some of the most hardcore bodybuilders in the business.

This outstanding effort by Prince consists of mostly spare jazzy R&B tunes, driven by incredibly loose, free-flowing live instrumentation.  I could only begin to tell you about the stylistic variety on this album.  With the three disc format there is a lot to absorb, and the third disc really can largely be done without, but the first two truly do rank amongst his best work.  It should also be noted how especially romantic Prince is on this album.  This album was made around the time that he entered into his first marriage, and it shows because this c.d. is overflowing with outstanding romantic ballads.  Most of his albums only contain one or two ballads, so if you've been longing for an album that includes more, then this album should really appeal to you.  This c.d. does not fit into the "standard" Prince "mold" ( I know that it is perhaps a bit oxymoronic to speak of a "Prince mold" but his personal signature is not quite as bold on this album as it is on many of his other works, even those that are admittedly not as good).  The reason for this is that Prince follows rather than leads on a good portion of this album.  The fact that there are two covers on the first disc alone shows that Prince was in the mood to do what was being done instead of doing something new (he covers songs by Bonnie Raitt and The Stylistics) which is unsual for this constant innovator, but this album is so great because he is so skillful that he does it better than almost anyone else.  One minor problem that I notice is that it seems that on a few songs particularly on the first disc, Prince just doesn't pay much attention to the lyrics.  There are too many generic R&B come-ons and cheesy cliche 90's catch phrases such as "gettin' your groove on', and Prince is much too clever, witty, and creative to resort to such things. But, really that is just a minor quibble because the music truly is consistently outstanding throughout the first two discs.  And then, he has songs such as "Soul Sanctuary" and "Let's have a baby" which are two of the most well-written ballads that I've heard from him.  "In this bed I scream" is just magnificent both lyrically and musically.  He takes the lead again on this track and he does it in a major way.  This clever, poetic, and romantic track has an infectiously catchy both rhythm and melody that would easily pack any dance floor.  Other highly impressive moments include the high powered funk of "We gets up", the absolutely brilliant and stunning arrangement on "Curious Child", and the sincere, pure passion of the just so perfect R&B/gospel blend of "Savior".  "Joint 2 Joint" is impressive just for having so much variety in terms of sounds and elements, with each part so effectively enhancing a different part of the story. The first two discs are really solid overall.  The third disc however finds Prince trying his hand at techno and other forms of conventional dance/club music, and the results are not very impressive.  But, I don't see how they could be, even coming from Prince.  Techno for the most part is insanely repetitive, monotonous, and downright drone-like.  There are only three songs on disc three that were really worth it (Slave, My Computer, and the title track).  Well, maybe four, his cover of "La la (means I love you)" is actually really good too.  Those songs could have been put on the first two discs and the 3rd disc really could have been omitted.  The most impressive feat that he manages to accomplish on this entire album is making a great chorus and a great song out of the line "www 'dot' emale `dot' com" on "Emale" :-).  I was unaware of this feat for a while because I used to always skip this song because it started off with that really annoying 90's G-funk whistle.  So overall, this album really does rank amongst Prince's best work, and it should especially appeal to those who would like to see him do more ballads and dive into more R&B
These guys and this album rocks.  Just because the songs force you to move other parts of your body beside your head, doesn't 'demote' it to pop.  Props to the great use of two bass guitars.  Released amid the misery/grunge rock explosion of the early 90's, this was a great escape into rock that just simply made you feel good again. This album is highly recommended.  Kill Your Television, Grey Cell Green, Cut Up, Throwing Things, Happy, and Until You Find Out are just an awesome experience.  If you can find the Grey Cell Green single release, I highly recommend that for the track entitled 'Trust.' 
Joan. You don't love me. Because I'm a guy. But I have loved you since 1976. Ok so I'm an old man (age 43). So what. She's just the best rock and roll female on the planet. I like the young ones like Sahara Hotnights and the Donnas as well but they just don't measure up to Joan Born To Be Bad Jett. This album - like most of her other albums - consists of a mix of old and new songs. Doesn't mattar. I love it. And the video... well it confirms what we have always known. Not that it matters. The music matters
I bought this CD on a whim after I heard Joaquin Phoenix was directing their "Tired of Being Sorry" video.  Whoa!  I was addicted!  I couldn't stop listening to it...I had to get a 2nd copy for the car just so I could stop carrying it back and forth.  GREAT driving music!  The songs are catchy and have a great beat...I haven't heard anything this good in a long while.  I had to have more immediately and luckily found some earlier stuff of Scott Thomas'....more on the acoustic/indie side, but awesome!  I highly recommend Lovers & Thieves (CDbaby.com)  My faves from Ringside are "Struggle", "Trixie", and "Dreamboat 730". You will not be disappointed
I used to listen to a friend's copy of the original "Metal Box" of EP's, when it first came out.Years later the "Second Edition" came out on LP's for those of us who hadn't sprung for the Metal Box before it sold out.Eventually the Second Edition came out on this CD. So I finally could own a digital copy myself. Pristine, audio quality at least as good as the original Metal Box in my opinion, if I remember correctly.You do need to listen to this. You do need to buy a copy and get other people to listen to this too
I feel bad doing this becuase I love Iggy and the stooges but the quality on this set is pretty bad. All the live recordings are worth listening to and probably owning but the quality is very rough and can get frustrating. It's like the first Beatles Anthology set: the material is amazing but the quality is bad. On the plus side the studio outtakes are decent quality wise and amazing content wise. The packaging is also very nice. I just though I'd share this information before you drop all the money on the set. If you are a Stooges fan don't hesitate purchase now but if this is your introduction you should probably wait.
I love jazzy hip-hop of the early '90s and if you do too,this is the album you must listen to! all the songs are wonderful but there are some of these which are something of supernatural like the famous (and the most beautiful of the entire cd!) "Award Tour", "Steve Birko(stir it up)" and "Midnight".enjoy this pearl of REAL hip-hop!!!
OMG!! This is Relient Ks best CD yet. You should buy it, even if you didn't care for their other CDs. Because....well...it ROCKS!!
I read some of the other reviews before I submitted this.  I don't see how someone could get upset over the liner notes.  Redd doesn't include Danny Gatton as an influence because he didn't listen to him.  As far as other reviews concerning tone and the lack of fire, well, I don't even know how to address that.  Redd has one of the best tones I've heard on the tele and his note selection is what sets him apart from other pickers.  Ever hear of diarrhea of the guitar?  Well, you won't get that on this CD because Redd doesn't play something to just play it.  This CD showcases Redd's versatility from country, to swing, to blues, to rock, it has it all.  If you like good pickin', then by this CD
what a beautiful album! one of the rare albums that  has no fillers or weaker cuts. i'd call it a classic but that makes it sound dusty. these songs could come out in 20 years and still sound fresh. 
Unlike other classical-crossover artists minus Emma Shapplin, I believe Sarah Brightman works for art, not for money, or fame, or show off. Like what she said in an interview, she sees music a a whole--music is to be enjoyed (and categorization should never get in the way). That's apparent from this very endearing album La Luna.I think this album is as a whole better than any song in it although my favourites are still the mystical Figlio Perduto, the dreamy Serenade/How Fair this Place, the gloomy Gloomy Sunday, and the sweet La Luna. I read what a reviewer said about how any other sopranos could sing better than Sarah on La Luna/Song to the Moon. I think that's not true, at all. Just because the singing isn't wagnerish, it doesn't mean it's easy or lacking in technique or whatever he said. I think it's easier to just sing full out operatic like, say, Renee Fleming than singing with so much passion and being lilting without losing any of the voice's qualities (laid back with 'THAT' voice at the beginning and successively powerful at the end). And, duh, she sings classical properly, ffs.And tell me a name of a soprano who could sing How Fair this Place with such grace, without sounding like a screeching steel can.I've also listened to many other versions of Gloomy Sunday. Billie's is weird. Sarah McLachlan's is out of context. Sinead o' Connors' is shabby although the intelligence behind the singing is fine. Only Sarah Brightman's and Bjork's versions are best for my ears.I have introduced her music (from Phantom of the Opera to Dive to Timeless to Harem) to many people, and apparently they enjoy them very much! There is this radio that's a favourite of us where Gloomy Sunday and Time To Say Goodbye are played as much as Bon Jovi's It's My Live and Sophie Ellis Bextor's Take Me Home and Offspring's Pretty Fly. They're good music and enjoyable.Albeit I also like many other sopranos. I like Lucia Popp's interpretation of Richard Strauss' lieders, Christa Ludwig's of Schubert's, Natalie Dessay, Kiri te Kanawa, etc. :
Although the real roots lie with the black artists who inspired these guys, the PBBB is where the hippy generation,(this is a couple years pre-San Francisco, and before the Stones and Beatles began stretching their arrangements out on record),learned to JUST PLAY. Their next record was more representative of what they were actually doing live at time time, and is the single greatest influence on what became the San Francisco sound of the late 60's and early 70's, (REALLY long and experimental jamming), so this is in fact the &quot;roots of the roots of the roots&quot; of todays jam bands and guitar-heavy blues bands, mixed-race bands, and, for all practical purposes, the white-blues-man in todays' world
I bought this recording along with Blood on the tracks recently and all I can say is "Doggonit" it don't get any better than this.  They called Elvis the king but Bob Dylan must be  the "Wizard".  Who will tell us great stories when he is gone?
This was the first Punk-O-Rama CD I listened to, and boy I was not dissapointed. Most of the songs on this CD are the type of punk I would listen to, Quite fast and energetic. The best song on the CD has to be either NOFX - Bath of Least Resistance (NOFX being the greatest punk band of all time, of course), or Beatsteaks - Let me in. I heard the Beatsteaks for the first time on this CD and there absolutely bloody excellent. Obviously, The Cd is made complete with songs from the Descendents, Pulley, Pennywise, Dropkick Murphy's. The only let down on this CD is Noise Conspiracy, there song on this CD, well plainly sucks i'm sorry to say. But overall this CD is one hell of a good listen if your into punk. That's all, oh yeah, buy it! by
Wow!  There's sooooo... much to like in this album it's amazing.  The music is mostly upbeat & very catchy--making you want to (& will if no one's around) sing along.  The lyrics are fine, meaningful, & personally touching--about life which is getting faster & faster in the contemporary world, while people are still people with hopes, feelings, needs, desires, & all the rest of what makes people human.  The lead singer, Jennifer Nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice (though a bit twangy in style).  She grabs you quickly for a wild ride--immersing the listener in the musical story she's telling.  I bought the CD based on hearing Baby Girl & Something More (on the TV show Vegas of all place).  Then I heard Sugarland on the CMA show--winning awards as they so deserve.  The range & variety of the songs on the album are good too--from sweet & poignant ballads to wild & spicy soaring.  Virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to & the majority could become successful singles.  Yes, the style is their own mixture of influences--the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds, which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive.  And, the trio wrote all the songs on the CD--with Hall the primary author (solo writer on one of them).  How many trios are there with 2 women & 1 man?  I wonder if they are unique?  Well, they are unique even if not in that respect--how many bands include a mandolin?.  Of course, country purists may not be happy with them, but the vast majority of listeners ARE.  This has become one of my favorite albums, at the speed of sound.  IMHO, it's terrific
This CD is great.  It is a must have.  Picture yourself in the wild or on a lake in a boat and a thunderstorm comes rolling in slowly.  You hear the rain, the thunder in the distance, you sense the storm getting closer.  The storm is over head, loud piercing thunder claps and you duck for cover.  The thunderstorm slowly moves out but the rain is a constant presents.  The thunder rolls on but the wild life moves in, bullfrogs, owls in the distance, all the animals are alive now.  This cd is all in one, the real deal.  It is not all thunder.  I love it.  I also bought Thunderstorm [Rykodisc]; this was a waste of money.  To me, in my opinion it sounds like the storm just knocked the cable out, static and more static. 
This is The Jacksons second album for epic and producers Gamble and Huff. It would be their last with Gamble and Huff but together they made a great album that doesnt get the play it should. Music's Takin Over, Different Kind of Lady and Do What You Wanna are great, catchy dance tracks. The real greatness here lies in the ballads where Michael's voice is in peak form. Even Though You're Gone and Find Me A Girl are classic ballads. So good, I feel that Find Me A Girl is probably the best Michael Jackson song you've never heard. This is probably Michael Jackson's most overlooked album and its one of his best! The Jacksons all sing together great and you can see why Destiny and Triumph were such big hits after this one was recorded. Overall, great ballads, catchy feel good dance tracks, and Michael Jackson singing his heart out. Get this, you will not be dissaponted
This CD is truly a classic and one of my all-time favorites. Love it
I've had this cd since it came out and it continues to be my favorite.  It's a cd that I can put in anytime and thoroughly enjoy.  This would be my pick for the cd to have while stranded on an island.  It never gets boring and made me appreciate just how good Schon is.  Unbelievable. If you like this, you'll like Eric Johnson's Venus Isle album too.  Two of my all time favorites
Buy it. Now. Stop reading. Are you still reading???? Okay, so I'll tell you my reason why. Reason(s) why. 5.1 sound. DTS. Different (some versions better to my ears/psyche) than the CD. Flavor. Beautiful production. Did I mention DTS - you gotta hear this in DTS. And she and her band deserve and have earned every penny you could spend on her (gratuitously inciting flaming). I am just hoping that she will give us the opportunity to have DVD's covering her 'Girl in the Other Room' and her 'From This Moment On'.
My son loves music and really likes Dan Zanes.  We started with the videos on Disney and the "catch that train" song really got us singing, so we ordered this CD.  Now my son sings along with it, dances and jumps around.  Dan Zanes really is fun for the family
A lot of music fans have mused over why Matthew Sweet did not achieve greater success with the masses despite his obvious ability to write very catchy songs. "Sick of Myself" single-handedly rejuvenated my faith in the power of pop music at a time when pop seemed to have exhausted its possibilities. But in retrospect Sweet simply wasn't a very marketable commodity for the music industry, and on top of that his vocals and lyrics somehow didn't grab people. Its not that he doesn't sing with passion or feeling, but somehow the words seem to get lost in the mix. Perhaps its a production thing; regardless, the vocals on a MS album always seem to be secondary to the music and that is a no-no for any great singer-songwriter. There are some truly impressive (albeit derivative) stuff here: "What Matters" is in my opinion the greatest Byrds song never written, "Hide" is a beautiful piano ballad that wouldn't seem out of place on Badfinger compilation, "If Time Permits" has some of the most beautiful chorus harmonies not written by Brian Wilson, etc. etc. "I've Been Waiting" works well in combining catchy melody with plaintive adolescent desire, and "Girlfriend" is for the most part a great rocker. However, after the relatively simple production of Girlfriend, his later albums got bogged down in an attempt to recreate a "wall of sound" feeling, which quite frankly doesn't really work unless you're Phil Spector. Not much here can be completely discounted and the new songs fit in quite well (although I probably would have included "Evangeline" at the expense of "Ready"). Despite the undeniable quality of the music there is nothing life-changing here and ultimately great music must at least have the semblance of being life-changing. Still heartily recommended for fans of catchy, melodic pop-rock
I can't say with the wordsmust listen!
 This album came out about 8 years before I was born. All the years, I still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play WBSS or Billie Jean. Now I know all the lyrics and music videos from this album. This is MJ in his prime. Unfortunately, we will never get another epic like this again. Michael is sadly a target in the media, but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not. Every song off here is a classic. One song I thought was unneccesary was "Baby Be Mine". But otherwise, it's excellent. If you starting an MJ collection, get this album first. Trust me.
I'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews, this CD is amazing. It's not anything like Soundgarden or Audioslave - but it's amazing none-the-less. Every song on here is beautifully written, and, as always, Cornell's voice doesn't disappoint. It's different, but one of my new favorite CDs
I owned the album as a kid.......I enjoy it as much now as I did then
I first encountered Bird3 opening for Veruca Salt the summer of 2001.  That band had put their faith into Bird and so have I.  We fell in love with them all together.  This band has successfully combined infectious pop hooks with soul-baring lyrics to create something unique, beautiful, and far from most of the trite pop or rock music you hear on the radio today.  You'll find yourself not only humming along, but holding this music close to your heart at your most intimate moments.  You will not once regret buying this piece of art
Kudos to Harvey Fierstein for being so true to the Jean Poiret play. Jerry Herman did a wonderful score - my favorite song was "The Best of Times". Gene Barry turns out to be a good singer, esp paired with the talented George Hearn
I love that garage days re-re visited is on the flip side...in the cassette I had warped a long time ago!  I like this one
I love EVERY track on Ne-Yo's CD "in my own words!" Next let me thank Ne-Yo for bringing true R&B back to the industry! I dont consider songs about cheating on your bf/gf/husband/wife R&B. R&B is supposed to be about love - thats why people call them slow LOVE songs. And from 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs didn't exist. I ended up listenin to the same songs from da 90's over and over until I got so tired of them, and was fortunate to be lucky enough for my radio station (that plays mostly rap: a genre of music I dont like) to play "so sick" by Ne-Yo. It was a great song. This is literally the FIRST and only R&B album that I never have the urge to use the fast forward feature to get to the next song! Ne-Yo's lyrics are strictly romantic and sweet too! He is a lyrical genius. His voice is soothing and melodic. Most R&B albums obviously have rap tracks or rushed R&B songs as filler to probably meet the deadline or get the CD out as fast as possible and reducing the enjoyability of the CD, but THIS album has ALL songs that are great. All of the tracks on this album are great, but here are the ones that are SUPERB:1. So sick - 9/10 (would be a 10 if it wasn't played over and over and with so many different versions. Although I can still listen to it over and over2. When you're mad - 9/10 (for those guys who like the look on girls faces when they get mad. Maybe for Michelle Rodriguez fans. :) )3. Get Down Like that 10/10 (both versions) (I call it "dont get down like that") (This song is for the guys that are completely faithful like me) (if you're not a player, and proud of being faithful, this is da song for you)4. Sexy Love - 10/10 (great song. um hmmm.. what can i say about THIS one about its lyrics?.... oh yes.... this song is for the guys who have a girl and when she touches them, it just feels like.... Magic.)This is da only CD dat ever deserved 5 stars by me, the only reason I gave OTHER R&B albums 5 stars is cuz i took into consideration: there was no R&B album that existed that had NOTHING but good tracks, and most had poorly done upbeat song
I love this Pretenders album and Chrissie always rocks but I love the songwriting skill of Billy Steinberg & Tom Kelley.  They wrote "Love Colours", "Night in my Veins" and the hit "Stand by You".  Her follow-up to this, "VIVA! EL AMOR!" also contains three tracks written by them.  I purchased this long after its release and was glad I did.  Steinberg Kelley write memorable hooks and good lyrics with interesting chord changes.  Something not all big names can do on their own and Chrissie wisely is aware of this.  
This album is absolutely fantastic! Paul and the band are incredibly tight and sound great together. Paul sounds very loose and like he's having a lot of fun - not as serious as some live shows I've heard.The songs focus mostly on his solo records, with some Jam and Style Council mixed in (all on disc two). Wisely, only five of the twenty three tracks are from "As Is Now" and they're the uptempo ones - it's not a hard sell by Yep Roc to make you buy that album if you don't already have it.The extended jams for "Porcelain Gods/Broken Stones," "In The Crowd" and "Foot Of The Mountain" (one of my favorite solo tracks) all are focused and don't wander so they keep your attention. The crowd is energetic and into the show and are very appreciative when the Jam and Style Council classics get into the mix (although the sing-along to the album closing "Town Called Malice" is pretty lame).I haven't listened to the somewhat difficult to find "Live Wood" concert disc for a while to give a good comparison. However, since "Catch-Flame" covers all his solo discs instead of only "Paul Weller" and "Wild Wood," this is a more balanced collection. Highly recommended!personal highlights:Blink And You'll Miss ItUp In Suze's RoomPorcelain Gods/I Walk On Gilded SplintersIn The CrowdFoot Of The MountainThat's EntertainmentBroken StonesLong Hot SummerShout To The To
If you're a Strummer fan who is an historical completist then you'll want this disc.   Also, there are some really good tunes on here for anyone, particularly Joe's "Keys to Your Heart".  Some of the live material here is high quality and some is not.  This is likely not a CD you will listen to over and over again as you would artists who are fresh.  But, I'm just glad this finally appeared on disc as I've always wanted to hear it and as a Joe fanatic, I had to have it.  There's moments here that sound like a rough draft of JS and the Mescaleros, but also moments of pure rock 'n roll circa mid 70's with some great guitar solos.  If Joe had not been where UK punk started after this band there's no telling what he would have done but you can be sure he'd have kept playing in a band.  I'm a huge Clash and Strummer fan, but I rate this 4 stars more for its historical significance than for the actual quality and uniqueness of the content
At first I didn't think there was enough new material on this soundtrack to make it worthwhile, but the four previously unreleased songs are so completley wonderful, especially &quot;All I want to know&quot; and &quot;Heather&quot;.  This is an essential for any Stephin Merritt fan
While not dissimilar to other excellent acts such as Coldplay, Keane, and Pete Yorn, Travis have distinguished themselves as a band with their own unique style and sound. This, their 2nd album, is the best of their music: melodic throughout, with catchy tunes, solid lyrics, and tremendous guitar work that captures the listener from the first chords of 'Sing' to the fade-out from 'The Humpty Dumpty Love Song'.If you buy an album once you know three or four or more of its songs are excellent, then I confidently recommend The Invisible Band to you. Rating each song individually for one's ipod: 1. Sing, Side, The Cage, Afterglow and the Humpty Dumpty Love Song are each worthy of four to five stars2. Pipe Dreams, Flowers in the Window, Safe, Follow the Light, and Indefinitely are three to four star songs3. The balance are two to three stars each. The only poor effort is probably "Last Train", which is too plodding relative to its counterpartsThe Invisible Band is basically a healthy mix of folksy, hopeful songs mixed with just the right amount of melancholy. Nowhere is this better reflected than in 'The Humpty Dumpty Love Song', which defines this mix perfectly. While this is the best of the album, the rest is well worth listening to repeatedly.  Highly recommended
I love this album. Mc Lyte is one of the best female rappers.How can someone not like her rap
This album is simply one of the coolest things around, and when I listened to it, it inspired me to a similar project using the same 'weaving and zoning from place to place' kind of method. What this basically is, are field recordings of various different indigenous and mainstream musics from mostly Indian/Middle Eastern/Oriental festivals; they are then mixed together nicely into one flowing peice. You get Indian gamelan, mussette accordion, vocal choruses, foreign tongue talking, and psychadelic bagpipes all in one 33 minute track, and then some. It's very trippy, and it hints at some kind of endless dream where we flow from place to place without reason. Get this for your own good
I recently discovered Joyce Cooling. Yeah, I've been in the dark ages. She is one of the smoothest guitarists out there and she does not try to sound like everyone else. I especially appreciate her percussive use of intonations. She's got chops galore and is a beautiful woman to boot. You can hear it all in her music. Buy Revolving Door! You'll love it
Immerse yourself in the incredible genius of Mark O'Connor and his amazing chameleon-like creative ability to tease so many different moods and styles from his violin. If you like Cajun music - this is for you.  If you like Western Swing - this is for you.  If you like foot tapping fiddle with a Celtic slant - then this is for you! Classical? Jazz? Blues? Country Rock?  Then yeah - you guessed it - this is for you! This is an absolutely fantastic album - a brilliant collection of melodies that bring together some of today's greatest violinists.  Pure Genius
I love this CD!  Everything they sing about is so true to life.  It's a great arrangement of songs
The slowed down almost spoken version of Downpressor Man nearly makes it worth the purchase price alone.  Sure I've got most of the tracks on other Tosh collections, but these recordings are excellent variants
I must agree with the comments made by other reviewers.  This album is great.  Nancy Wilson's voice on this album is unlike anything I have ever heard.  You can't honestly say you're a fan of jazz if you don't own this
Several tunes on 'Back to Oakland' feature Tower of Power at their best.  One in particular that keeps me coming back is the deeply funky instrumental track, 'Squib Cakes'.  Featured soloists include a short, mellow guitar solo from Bruce Conte, followed by Greg Adams' fluegelhorn that first lurks in the pedal range (leading one to believe it's a trombone!) and then soars brilliantly higher and higher to a dramatic finish.Tenor madness abounds from lead saxman Lenny Pickett (known primarily for his work as lead Tenor for the Saturday Night Live band), wailing in-tune in the difficult altissimo range (jazz musicians call these 'freak notes' because they are not notes typically included in the range of the instrument ... ), while at the same time refusing to compromise on excellent rhythmic and melodic ideas throughout. Chester Thompson completes the soloistic foursome with a chunky Hammond organ solo that takes you back to a smoky bar in LA in the early 70s - without the probability of cancer.  Lyrical yet hard-driving, Thompson lulls us first into his solo space by filling in behind the band as they chant 'Squib Cakes', then takes off on his own flight, delving out perfect 16th-note runs as though Bach suddenly had learned some jazz Hammond himself.  In the middle of the solo, as if to a testament to the tightness of the groove, Thompson lingers on a treble note in his right hand, chunks out chords so symmetrically with the rest of the rhythm section with his left, that in the days of hearing this on vinyl, I wondered if my record was skipping through that section!  To finish the groove, at the end of Thompson's solo, the horns return to fill in a bridge with quick triplets.  After he closes, we're back to the head to close out the tune. Even with so much to savor, this syncopated gem will leave you hungering for more, even after the final stroke of the last chord.  The musicianship and tightness of their groove more than make up for the bland lyrics on the album's other tunes.  I have listened to this album for 30 years and revel in its freshness every time I spin it. I recommend it as a definite primer for anyone wishing to explore Tower of Power's "sound."- Kathryn Shut
This CD is a classic, a must for all those who loved the movie. I wondered if I would get a crackling type of sound, but it is as crystal clear as the movie sound. This is perfect for those who want to practice the songs for a "sound of music" event or a singing class!
I don't know where this guy gets off saying that the drummer, Jorge Rossy, and the bassist, Larry Grenadier, &quot;are competent but do nothing overtly interesting&quot;.  Jorge incredible groove, use of space, and musicality is as good as one could ask for, and Grenadier's huge warm tone, amazing time, and great thematic development is unparalleled by other bassists of his generation
The beats is cool, but you understand his lyrics! &amp; its not bout all that pimp trash! SNOOP NOT A PIMP...but this is a bangin C
The music intelligentia probably won't like James Morrison's new album because almost everybody else will love it.  Bourgeois = uncool.  However, if you just listen and feel this album, even if you have snobbish tendencies, it will move you.  Enjoy this amazing new album.  I am

I saw this band open for Placebo in Tampa, Fl. I had never heard of them before that night. I bought the CD immediately. Though it's a bit plain, It's a GREAT CD. It's a comforting kind of plain & It rocks. I played it in my cd player for about a month straight. The lead singers voice is unique. This band definitely has much potential to become a well known group. A great debut album. If you ever get to see them live DO IT! Their live show definitely makes the cd come alive.
The Best R&B Band Ever!!! I know some will disagree with me, but this is the band that really rock my boat. I mean, they were awesome and it wasn't forced or fake. The rawness of their funk is sooo addictive that you will never put this cd down. I am in the process of getting ALL their cds, but this one is a great way to be introduce to their music
And he know's nothing about popular music and really should get back to work and stop sitting around convincing himself that he does.  Dumbass
THIS IS A CD THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE! THERE ARE FOUR GREAT VOICES AND THEY DO COUNTRY MUSIC THE WAY IT SHOULD BE! LORRIE MORGAN IS THE BEST AND I LIKE EVERYTHING ON THIS!! BUY IT AND ENJOY! CHERY
For someone who knows little about Bach and wants to learn something, you couldn't do better than to give them this CD.  Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra give their signature warm, plush sound to the work of the great Johann Sebastian Bach, making him sound very nearly like a Romantic rather than a baroque or classical composer.  This is not a bad thing--some complain that Bach, with his mathematical leanings, leaves them cold.  That isn't possible with the inviting material on this CD
Nas' Street's Disciple definitely has plenty of memorable/outstanding cuts on it. Nas sounds very confident and his lyrical skill is prevelant throughout both discs. The subject matter varies which is way cool in that, it delivers to all audiences of his fans. Every Nas fan will be doing themselves a huge favor by supportin him and pickin this up today. A
Plain and simple...Cage is one of the best Underground rappers around.....And soon after Hell's Winter drops I think he will be accepted into mainstream......This CD is Cage at his craziest, the beats are hott, the rhymes are hot...BUY THIS CD....and if you like this CD buy some of his other CDs, Weatherproof, Night Hawks, Smut Peddler's : porn Again, The Leak Brothers: Water World, and Hell's Winter
Spice 1's just different from every other rapper. And he's awesome. If you love hardcore rap, you'll love Spice 1
Fluke's latest album had been long in coming, and plagued with issues (word on the grapevine is one of the trend-setting trio left some point during production).  Still, years after their masterpiece Risotto, Fluke has returned intact and delivered another album, the oddly titled Puppy.Puppy is for the most part a dark album.  It's clearly the evolution of the track Absurd (off Risotto) and its particular taste of big beat techno, with numerous tracks featuring similarly styled lyrics and vocals.  The sound has been expanded with touches of industrial guitars and beats that would sound right at home in Prodigy's Fat Of The Land or at a Nine Inch Nails concert.  The opening Snapshot shows this most evidently.  The album takes up a rave feel with the tracks Another Kind Of Blues (a remix of the stellar number Zion featured in The Matrix Reloaded and its soundtrack) and Hang Tough, which flow into each other and result in a mesh of old-school rave beats with new-school industrial grooves.  YKK is a wicked track that would easily be at home in a big-budget spy or action flick, while Expo is a sweeping and epic song.  Blue Sky is as close to an uplifting number you'll find on the CD, with a full choir used in the song's chorus.Compared to Risotto, Puppy inevitably comes up short.  Like BT's Emotional Technology, Puppy has the misfortune of being the follow-up album to a complete and utter masterpiece (Puppy to Risotto, Emotional Technology to Movement In Still Life).  And let's face it: it's hard to surpass yourself when release an album that's nigh-perfect.  Still, I wasn't sure what to expect with Puppy and I found myself pleasantly surprised.  It's darker and meaner, but it's an overall rock-solid album, and fans of the grittier side of Fluke (Absurd, Atom Bomb) will likely be pleased with Puppy
If you like late 60s British rock-psych, tough-not-fey production/vibe, white-soulful vox, and mixing electric/acoustic elements (think: a cross among BEATLES + ZOMBIES + TRAFFIC + SMALL FACES, even a lil' BYRDS feel occasionally), you shimply MUSHT try ROLLED GOLD, which compares to the cream of these groups' output!! -"the Ac-WHO-"!? you might well say...'Where have they been all our life?'; 'A gem beyond price has languished all these years unsavored,' we repeat nearly speechless. Not since our belated introductions to Moondog...Skip Bifferty...Billy Nicholls...Stones' "Metamorphosis"...Dantalian's Vehicule...It can easily be yours.We very rarely care to replay any c.d. over and over but this one warrants such: well-crafted blend of nonchalance poetry and passion, delicacy and yarbles, hooks and chops and pacing and SONGS up there with the legends. The news that this cohesive album was only DEMO'S* ('haps fortuitous in retrovision) catapults one's estimation higher still.Singer Reg King: on ROLLED'S strength his visage deserves a spot on some Rushmore-in-Avalon alongside fellow soulful Brits Winwood/ Marriott/ Reid/ Lloyd/ Stewart...: just hoarse enough/just sweet enough (+ a 'secret': optimal use throughout of unison doubletracking)...perfection. ROLLED GOLD'S production is on the raw/monoish/hotly-compressed side-- a flute/piano occasionally to augment the basic guitar quartet formula & keep things unexpected-- suiting the songs & performances to a Tee (just to offer another clue to their magic brew).Homey's in no way related to any bandmember..
Leo Kottke is a national treasure.  He is our greatest living solo acoustic guitar virtuoso.  Having said that, you'd expect his CDs to be at a very high level of brilliance.  I have at least a dozen of his titles.  If there is any trouble in deciding the merits of any one disc, it's because there are so many Kottke releases to choose from."One Guitar, No Vocals" clearly ranks as one of the best.  The compositions tickle my brain, warm my heart, and put a bounce into my step.  The guitar playing is dazzling.  You really get a glimpse of the man behind the guitar by listening to this music - brilliant, thoughtful, odd, complex, quirky, a huge heart, and the wackiest sense of humor.  It's spirited music, so thoroughly drenched in the personality of its creator that it's unmistakably and immediately recognizable as Leo.  The world is full of acoustic guitar instrumentalists these days.  Some of them are quite excellent.  Many are not.  But there is only one Leo Kottke.  And his guitar music is a gift to the world.A very strong recommendation for this CD
For hard-driving well-crafted rock-and-roll from the late 70s/early 80s, you can't do much better than Pat Benatar (and Heart) and this collection carries most -- but not all -- of the singles that dominated the airwaves for 4 years: Heart Breaker, Hit me With Your Best Shot, Love is a Battlefield, Fire and Ice, Promises in the Dark.  But no Benatar collection is complete without 'Treat Me Right', 'You Better Run', and 'I Want a Lover who won't drive me crazy' (superior, in my opinion, to the John Mellencamp version), especially if you prefer Benatar's hard-driving rockers to her slower ballads.   Nevertheless, 'Best Shots' is a great place to start and certainly - at $10-15 versus $50 for the more complete 'All Fired Up' --  the best value for the money.  
My personal favorite dashboard cd.  Every other one of their cds have maybe a few good songs that I like, but the places you have come to fear the most has pretty much a solid tack lis
Ummm if you buy it you will know I borrowed it from a friend and he never  got it back...so I bought him another
Solas' previous CD &quot;Words That Remain&quot; is a classic in Irish traditional music and the loss of Karan Casey certainly affects their sound on this album. However, instrumentally they are incredibly strong and as inventive as ever and Deirdre Scanlon is a gifted singer with a wide range of styles. I don't think the choice of tracks is quite so strong but it is a powerful performance of a very high order of music. The instrumental playing at times leaves you breathless and the energy levels are very high. There are some lovely songs - i like &quot;Bonnie Mae&quot; and &quot;Miner's Life&quot; in particular and &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; is an original gem. I am disappointed to hear critics complain of the lack of &quot;traditional&quot; music on the CD and about the use of &quot;rock&quot; instruments. Based on those criteria the only instruments tolerated would be harp, uillean pipes, wooden flute and fiddle (tin whistle (flageolet), guitar, mandolin, bouzouki, accordion and banjo being modern, foreign invaders)and what a pity! What defines traditional - is it pre-Planxty? Can no more traditional songs be written? Seamus Egan and Co have done their apprenticeship in the rigorous disciplines from the book of traditional music (rhythm and melody) and have enriched it with a new chapter. In general i agree that bass and percussion is often unnecessary but in this case the augmentations are tasteful and generally effective. I would also highly revcommend Liz Carroll's &quot;Lost in the Loop&quot; although if you're a purist it has the Solas rhythm section playing on it and features many of Liz's &quot;brand new&quot; traditional tunes (brilliant)
In many ways, this album is everything one would have expected-- somehow the natural successor to "No Pussyfooting" and "Evening Star".  In other ways, its nothing like I would have expected-- the usual stamps of Fripp and Eno's recent work seems to be missing.Its really quite hard to largely identify the identity of the musician generating the sound on much of this material, there's obvious stuff (we'll come to that in a minute), but as a rule, the backgrounds could be either of them.  Sonically, it moves through a number of backdrops, with delicate, percussive, synthish loops dominating the early part of the record ("Meissa", "Lyra", "Tarazed"), wheras the middle of the record feels more like their old collaborations updated, the sort of modern Fripp soundscapes being more apparent ("Lupus", "Ankaa").  The remainder of the album features on track that is totally unexpected, the downright funky "Altair", with its train shuffling rhythms, drum loops, and funky guitar (in ways similar to material from the Eno/Schwaum "Drawn from Life" record), and the closer, "Terebellum", is an aggressive, haunting, and almost angry sounding piece almost reminiscent of "Radiophonics" or the other more aggressive soundscapes.Over this material, Fripp largely solos using a variant of his legendary fuzz tone-- its a bit mellower, and rounder though, similar to his leads on "Starless" and "The Power to Believe Part II" but in a more hushed feel.So that tells not much, the real question is, what's it like?  Largely an ambient affair, the collaboration is what you'd expect-- there's no real incindiery moments here-- don't look for a "Baby's On Fire", but it is comparable to their previous collaborations in quality, and it certainly sounds nothing like Crimson.  Some of it is full of delicate beauty ("Lyra"), some of its just a blast ("Altair"), some of its actually quite hard to listen to at all ("Terebellum").For fans of ambient music, especially the work of these two gentelemen, this one will be quite rewarding.  It falls short somehow of being a masterpiece, but it is really a great record.  Recommended
This album has new meaning to me now in 2007, where I go to a college next to a high school, where I see a bunch of "punk rockers" spending lots of money to make sure their hair is pretty and that their clothes are properly tattered to maximize trendiness.  There are plenty of punk rock bands out there that keep the spirit of Social Distortion alive, but sometimes their music is hard to find, and all the posers you see start to slowly extinguish that old punk rock fire.  Albums like this exist for times like those.  Just stick it in, turn up the volume, and rock out
I purchased my first Weill recordings in 1960, the off-broadway Threepenny Opera, and Lenya's Berlin Theater Songs. I have treasured them all my life. Lenya was, of course, incomparable, but Ute Lemper carries on her special genius. This new recording is as near a perfect realization of this unique masterpiece. John Mauceri gives the unique orchestration nuance that even Klemperer missed in his masterful Kleine Dreigroschenmusik. Every member of the cast, even the bit roles, is perfect in the characterization. Kollo is the first performer since Harald Paulsen (the origninal Mackie Messer) to bring all of the tradition of Viennese operetta to this music. He is a miracle. Macheath has subtle characteriztion hitherto unknown except from Paulsen. Most noteworthy is the Jenny of Milva. Two delightful bonuses in the recording: a reprise in Act 2 of Seerauber Jenny by Milva (the Jenny) and the inclusion of Lucy Brown's aria after the Jealousy duet. There is brief dialog before most pieces which  adds a dramatic integrity to the recording. I cannot find high enough praise for this new treasure
Ms. Melua is from Georgia.  Her voice is quite like the Swede, Lisa Ekdahl.  Neither has range or power; both have a little girl voice and plenty of finesse.  Both have musical partners.  In Ms. Melua's case it is Mike Batt who is to her what Nelson Riddle was to Linda Rondstadt, except that, in addition to arranging and conducting and coaching, he writes songs.  Most of this album are her and/or his songs.  They are well written and well treated.  They are are a careful team abnd do not cut corners.  Mr. Batt, among many other things, worked with Steeleye Span and Art Garfunkel long ago.The original sogs are interesting and liquid pleasant in rendition.  But my favorite cut is her rendering "Blues in the Night", which some might remember from Looney Tunes cartoons many decades past; "My mama done tole me..." it starts.  Knowing she cannot belt it, instead she works it.One short note on Steve Sale's engineering because another reviewer was crabbing about reverb and above all, clipping.  Perhaps because I bought it on vinyl, but I hear none of these defects.  My set is revealing, and it reveals excellent engineering, considering the largeish ensemble Mr. Batt has assembeled.  Fear not, unless the CD really is badly made
...heart-wrenching break-up with his girlfriend of 8 years, Elastica's Justine Frishmann.  13 is a dark record, produced by William Orbit.  Nearly every song is injected with despair, sorrow, bitterness, and an achy, heart-breaking sadness.  These moods are encompassed on such tracks as Tender, 1992, Battle, and the tear-jerking No Distance Left to Run.  Also included are the trip-hop masterpiece Trimm Trabb, the humourous Trailerpark and B.L.U.R.E.M.I., and Coxon and Albarn's co-written pop-masterpiece, Coffee and TV
I was introduced to Nitin through my cousin who lives in England. She saw him live in London and raved about it...so off I went in search of this artist. He was difficult to find; nonetheless I was determined. I am one of those people who love music from almost all genres, cultures and corners of the globe. In other words, I am not a radio-pop saccharine sweet loving music listener. I look for music that proposes thought (although I do believe even top 40 has its place) If you are looking for an album/artist that resonates emotion, along with a powerful subtlety check Nitin Sawhney out. You won't be disappointed.
Great Music, Great band. This is a must buy. Recommended to all hard rock lovers
Hell Rell did his job, I wasn't expecting anything as good as this. Hell Rell OUTDID himself.
Sometimes I like to look up and see what I can find on some of my favorite bands from the 70's and Starz being one of them. I was lucky enough to see the band play a few times around 77 and 78. Another band that took time for their fans!!!!!!!I read through the many reviews of posted here on amazon and not sure if there is much that I can add, also great to see that there were so many out there that enjoyed the band and their music. I would recommend reading about each of the Starz cd's and listening to the sound files if available and deciding for yourself........ I remember I liked this cd so much and the logo as well, I even hand- made a stencil and made my own Starz shirt, I think I used some of that gold "glue on glitter" in a tube and had one of the first Starz shirts, before the band even had any if I remember right.Lots of good songs on this cd,  Pull the Plug being one of my favorites both on the LP/CD and live. All good rock songs from a band that deserved a lot more.........I could go on trying to describe the music.......... too bad there are no sound files for this cd....... so you may just have to order it and take a chance. The remaining members have played a few shows during the past year or so and guitar player Richie Ranno continues to be active in the music business, you may even want to go over to starzcentral to get updated	and see what Richie and the band are up to. Singer Michael Lee Smith also had a brother that had his own band and later ventured into Hollywood....... but this is about Starz!!!...So.... I highly recommend checking out the CD's and starzcentral. Not to be confused with the movie channel or another band from Europe that is using the name recently
The title says it all, Im so happy I bought it and I listen to it all the time :
This album was released in the summer of '86 when Queen's radio airplay was at a rather low point in the U.S. and at a very high point in Europe.By now,the band had adventured into pop genres beyond rock,yet colouring their songs with their distinctive style of interpretation and playing.Here we find the gorgeous ballad ONE YEAR OF LOVE and the catchy FRIENDS WILL BE FRIENDS.The ominous anthem WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER and the Highlander themed PRINCES OF THE UNIVERSE are gems in this crown.The first two USA singles, the rocker ONE VISION (from Iron Eagle)and the danceable A KIND OF MAGIC barely cracked the US Top 40 in a decade when alternative music was preferred and classics were often overlooke
We are using this series of CDs in our homeschool music program - they are fantastic!   We especially love this one about Bach - what an awesome man!   The story of his life is told in a way that is very interesting and holds the children's attention while also using various pieces of his music in the narration.  It is done VERY well!   My children are gaining a tremendous amount of knowlege and appreciation for music through this CD and so are my husband and I
i do not own this CD, but i recently saw the doctor at a local jazz club and was blown away. He had a good sense of humor and was very worldly. He would ascend and spiral upwords untill every one in the club's heart rate had spead up 100 notches... and BOOM... he was back to being relaxed old lonnie. at the break i met him, and got an autograph. He was very insightful musical and with spoken words.I would reccomend seeing him live, aswell as buying his album
This is a great CD!  Each track fades up to full volume at the start and fades down to silence at the end.  This makes it nice to just play the entire CD or to loop one track since there are no sharp changes from one noise to another.  So far the Car and Washing machine tracks seem to be our baby's favorites.  When she outgrows the need for this white noise CD, we'll transition her to lullaby or classical music.  For now though, this CD helps us keep her on a schedule and well rested by helping keep her relaxed and usually asleep during her nap times.  As a bonus, the Waves and Rain on the Roof tracks are soothing for grown-ups needing to drown out noise while they sleep
Coming from a listener with a broad scope of musical preferences, Blues has always been a multi-faceted genre which can be broken down into the categories:Soulful Blues, Drinking Blues and Guitar Blues. "B.B King - Live At The Regal" is one of those recordings that just happens to capture all three.This recording is dear to my heart as I can remember far back as first or second grade when my grandmother (God Bless) used to play this on 8-track. She used to love herself some Riley "Blues Brother" King. This recording ALWAYS seemed to be in the player when my cousins and I would come over to visit and rest assured, You WILL hear it before you left to go home.At that time, Being the young naive kid that I was, I remember saying that I hated it and that it was old folks music. All grown up now, In an age where real music is practically unheard of in terms of what these young artists of today release on CDs, I have a newfound respect for real stuff like this. So instead of sitting around burning your brain cells trying to understand what this new generation is calling itself creating, You have decided to come to one of the first sources for good old fasioned real music....The Blues.In my opinion, "BB King Live At The Regal" is one of Mr. King's best recordings and with myself not being a big fan of live albums, This is one of those rare live pieces that captures the essence of what a live recording should sound like. Maybe not so much in terms of the musicianship but the overall performance of those involved. The arrangements were put together nicely & the musicians were all in a very tight vibe on this album and whoever was on the mixing board did an excellent job of capturing this essence. BB's pickin' and crooning mixed with the superb playing by the band make this a wonderful place to start for the blues or BB King enthusiast. It sounds as if it was made in a tasteful nightclub full of grown people who wanted to hear good music while having a good time. The ladies were screaming and the gentlemen were cheering and BB was playing at his best. The only gripe I have about this disc is that it is very short; which was typical considering the age and time that it was made but still essential and a solid lesson for anyone interested in Blues (especially Blues Guitar). I recommend getting this and BB's "Live In Cook County Jail". They both are live albums and both have some of the same songs on them but they were done in a different way and should still be heard.Good choice if you get this one.  
Robbie's flow corses through your veins causing a feeling of total ecstacy and rejuvination. To have a CD that has the power to lift your spirit and your soul is something I feel so honored to have in my possesion. Hats off to Robbie
The ufo space travel theme of Astonomy domine is continued on Let there be more light Saucerful of secrets and Set the controls. Rick wrights two songs are real good Remember a day is one of the best on here. Seesaw has interesting percusson. Corporal Clegg floyds first ww2 song is upbeat Syds song Jugband blues is one of the best early Pink Floyd songs.Saucerful of secerets is a good early Pink Floyd cd it is an important part of Pink Floyds history.
I received "The Piano" promptly, and in pristine, excellent condition.
For those who have watched the movie Jaws (ask yourself, who hasn't) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score John Williams did for it. This cd captures all the music from the movie perfectly, with some new elements thrown in that are not found in the film.The linear notes are bright and colourful and provide some interesting information, which gives the overall package a nice touch. The overall cd package is certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent. A highly recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants to relive the film through the music
Although this sports new remastering, unless you have either the Golden Hits CD available here at Amazon and your local CD shop, the now out of print Golden Celebration boxed set or the 2 volume "Patti Page Collection" series (Volume 2 is also out of print), this is unnecessary as it duplicates every track on Golden Hits except for Let Me Go Lover instead of With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming and the songs are arranged in a different order.  Fans are better off looking for the 2 previous out of print collections with Let Me Go Lover to obtain this track and for the rest of this stuff, either buy Golden Hits, the boxed set and the 2 volume Patti Page Collection series, and BTW, Vol. 1 is still in print so you can order it right here at Amazon
I have listened to this CD for the last several years before going to sleep at night.  I love classical music, and this is great music to help make my soul feel at peace and unwind after a taxing day. 
This EP is so good, that words cannot do it justice. They thought so too and exercised restraint (no lyrics) on this album. It is a departure from the previous album From the Vapor of Gasoline (which is also a very good album) in other ways, too, however; it features a more delicate production and more intricate interplay between the instruments. The production is such that it highlights the timbre of each instrument and, thus, their interdependency, whereas the previous album seemed content to let everything settle into a murky consistency at various points (usually when things started to rock). FTVOG also had the problem of being a bit monotonous (of course: in the end, you grew to enjoy it for all its shortcomings). All the Suits Began to Fall OFf seems to be flawless, however - a well-rounded tour; very beautiful, bold and particular. Try if you like: John Fahey, Tortoise, June of 44, Sea Tiger, etc
I bought this the year it came out, after seeing George in concert and it is great! Most of these were big hit songs and I found that I really loved the others too especially Hard Day
Great CD for young and old alike.  The music puts a smile on your face each time you listen to it.  I have it on in my car and it keeps me in a good mood at all times
Anais is one of the best cingers.I have seen her since objetivo fama, and she is just great.Don't listen to people who say this cd is bad because the are just hating.This cd is just great
What I love most about Scofield's recent guitar playing is the subtlety in his style. He is careful not to over do it, while still demonstrating skill and precision. His riffs are practically perfect and are very well placed.  The only problem with this is that with no vocals and many similar sounding  songs, I rarely make it to the end of this CD. Still for those who enjoyed  &quot;A Go-Go&quot;, this one is quite similar, so make sure to pick it up.  This quality funk CD with jazz undertones may not being groundbraking, but  is a great casual listen. (Guitarist can definitely pick up a few ideas  here!
When this album first came out, I felt jilted. But I recently had an oppertunity to listen to it for what it is and I think its a great album. Make no mistake, if you're a die-hard 80's rocker, you'll hate this album. The production is raw, and the songwriting is lean and mean as opposed to elaberate and detailed. But that doesn't mean that the musicianship is lacking on this record. If you can keep an open mind, I think this ablum is one that you'll love
No use thumbing the pages of Cale's elegant scrapbook of an autobiography, 'What's Welsh For Zen?, to glean hard data on this one melodic gem. Coming after the heady, if problematic days of the Velvets, there's barely an acknowledgement of it as he strides into his rock format. The abrasive thrashing rock of 'McBeth'(while indicating his imminent direction) serves the one discordant note. Throughout,Cale namedrops to effect learnedness without destroying the mood of a distant past. Language had been severed from lineal meaning, in rock, since Bob went electric. Pete Brown writing for Jack Bruce's towering masterpieces, 'Songs For a Sailor', & 'Harmony Row'; Keith Reid with Procul Harum, were mixing up the lyric medicine, presumably with other pharmacuticals & making sumptuous music on a par with 'Paris 1919'. That date? The birth of Surrealism,(and similar writing to Cale's efforts herein) perhaps? The Russian Revolution? Cale's singing on 1919 had a world weary distance to it, which suited the reflective jabberwocky of the songs; stretched out vowells on,'planing lakes', 'elephants that sing','looking out from here at half past France.' It was far from banal music, however saccharine the orchestral moves from strings, viola & piano Cale painted. These lyrics were baffling but made perfect poetic sense when sung. 'Locusts' was something of a revisiting to this pastoral mood but lacks the roundedness. 'Fragments of a Rainy Season' is a good retrospective concert. And some of the fuge written around the hommage to Andy Warhol is very moving stuff. Go John
Considered one of Coltrane's 'searching' periods, this CD has a lot to offer in the way of understanding Trane's restless nature. Never one to stand on laurels, Coltrane does indeed continue to set the bar 'higher' every time out. This one is mostly ballad and blues based, with the exeption of 2 tracks in particular which stand out - on both ends of the Trane spectrum. Track #2, "I Love You" finds him playing furious, cerebral runs on the instrument, and , frankly, not as 'listenable' as one may like; whereas the track with Donald Byrd is as 'in the pocket' as you'll ever hear. All in all, a very realistic look at a genius in motion
Never mind the fact that Jay introduced the jazz world to Charlie Parker. His band rocked! After Basie,nobody swung like McShann. this 2 dis set covers the big band sides and the later 40's small band jump blues sides. Anything by this man is worth listening to. Another great disc by the Proper label, who release wonderful compilations with informative booklets at a bargain price. Highly recommended
The music contained Trout Mask Replica is some of the most unique, acid-drenched art to ever be pressed. The songs on the album are mainly divided into folkish a capella tunes and the crazed jams the Captain and his band are known for. Several strange, unconventional themes are visited and revisted throughout the track list, such as bulbs, gingham, trout, and a variety of other surreal, sensously described wildlife. However, if there's any reason to buy Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica, it's to listen to the album as a whole. I find it difficult to listen to any other way. While I find this to be true, I do have favorites that I go to when introducing friends to the Captain, or simply jamming out to without dedicating myself to the full experience: "Ella Guru", "Dachaus Blues", "Dust Blows Forward", "Neone Meat Dream", and "Old Fart at Play" stick out
Dj Shadow is in my honest opinion one of the most overlooked artists in music today. Threading the thin line between commercial and underground, and finding his niche somewhere in between (as UNKLE says, the middle ground between light and shadow) DJ Shadow continues to impress with every release he puts forth. I was fortunate enough to pick this album up right after its release, and actually purchased it before I bought Endtroducing, which is by far DJ Shadow's best album, and one of the best albums ever made. By sampling elements from just about anywhere Shadow combines elements from our pop culture to create mini-movies of his songs which few artists can touch in terms of sheer production value, and the emotional effect that is created while listening to his music. I am actually glad I bought this album before Endtroducing as it has given me the time to truly appreciate this album for what it is; a work of art, and a continual growing of Shadow's talents. Had I bought Endtroducing before this and writtwn a review I'm sure I would have garnered it with a 4 star review, but that is simply not the case here. While Endtroducing is always going to be leaques above and beyond this album, Josh Davis has found a way here to go above and beyond what should be expected of an album, and given us an album that I'm sure years from now I will still find elements in it that will grow even more on me with time. Best enjoyed while driving or relaxing at home (possibly with a little mary in tow, if you know what I mean), the songs fluctuate with peaks and valleys of highs and lows, and the beats are flawless, especially when compared to a lot of the mainstream garbage that is put out in the record industry on a regular basis. See the thing is that Shadow bases his music upon how he feels, and artists that do this correctly achieve an emotional reaction from their music that the true artists of our world truly achieve. Radiohead for example has a way of doing this, and it is not surprising then that one of DJ Shadows favorite artists is Radiohead, they both fuse these elements into their music, and achieve monumental status in my opinion. The package design is equally well done as well showing an artists eye for presentation, and a graffiti influenced design to the overall package. If you enjoy this album then I highly recommend any of Shadows works: Endtroducing, Preemptive Strike, The Private Press, and In Tune and On Time, which is a live set recorded in support of this album. UNKLE is also a well thought out album which bridges the gap between hip-hop, rock and techno, with guest appearences by Mike D of the Beastie Boys, Thom Yorke from Radiohead, and others from throughout the music industry. If you've never heard of DJ Shadow before, then I must say that you are missing out, if you are at all interested in underground music, do yourself a favor and pick up any of Shadow's albums or collaborations, I guarantee you will extremely impressed, as with any good album the songs have a way of growing on you over time. Peace out
The Living In Oblivion series of CD compilations does something that many similar compilations do NOT do: they give us some great variety of "hits".There is no doubt that "Mickey" by Toni Basil was a huge hit. There's also no doubt that "Our Lips are Sealed" was a break out hit for the Go Go's, but the Funboy Three version wasn't. But what about "Living in a Box"? It only hit the Billboard top 100 at #89 in 1987. So why is it here? Why are a large number of these songs? They're not top 10 hits, right?Wrong!I'm sick to death of so many compilations relying on top 40 hits from the 80's. The U.S. music tastes are typically very different from those of Europe. Just because a song doesn't make the U.S. Billboard top 40 doesn't mean that it isn't a hit in other countries. And although I'm an American, my music tastes have always run more in line with those of Europe.I'm delighted that the Living in Oblivion series (and the Pop and Wave series) have incorporated a variety of hits from the U.S. and Europe. I also like that some of the more obscure groups and their songs are available on these compilations. There are several songs on these albums that never were released on CD (as they hadn't come into being at the time of the groups' albums initial releases), so albums such as these are the only place where you can find these hits. The Boys Don't Cry song "I Wanna Be a Cowboy" hit the Billboard charts at #12 in 1986, but the group disappeared soon thereafter. Then all of a sudden a dance version of that same song came out in the early 2000's and rocketed up the dance charts. Don't be misled, the Living in Oblivion series is one of the absolutely best series for a variety of music from the 80's. If you want to hear run of the mill, top 40 only hits from the 80's, well, then you'll just have to look elsewhere.Also, the liner notes and pictures of the groups included in the jewel box are really clever. You get to find out what the chart position was for the songs in the compilation and see what the groups looked like at the time of the song's release. My only issue with these liner notes is that the author of them seems to be disparaging the very music which these albums are espousing. Apparently many believe that the music from the 80's was vacuous and devoid of emotion. One need only listen to the song "The Promise" by the group "When in Rome"  (Living in Oblivion Volume 5) to know that such a statement is false. While that group only had this one hit and then faded into obscurity, "The Promise" made the Billboard Top 100 at #11 and the Billboard Dance Chart at #1.Anyway... I can't recommend this album and its entire series any more! It's simply awesome! Before believing those who would disparage this series of albums, please check the Billboard charts and you'll see that these songs were in fact hits.GET IT
Good Stuff! An excellent collection of original and classic gypsy jazz tunes, artfully performed by Jorgenson. I recommend it as an introduction to the virtuosity of John Jorgenson and the genius of Django Reinhardt
I have been looking for a particular song for several years.  This album had it
I beat the hell out of everything I own. My PDA which this has partially replaced has an aluminum hardshell case and a metal body. I have broken just every watch I have ever owned (and I have/had a few excellent watches). I am naturally hard on things due to my focus on life not on my gear. This little notebook has kept itself together so far, while looking very hip. I am a software engineer/project manager and am cognisant of my technological options, this is just faster, lighter and thinner than my PDA for scribbling notes. I am never without it in the office. The back folio pocket and the elastic strap looked dumb when I first bought it. However, I use the folio pocket for receipts to be reimmbursed (better than leaving them in a pocket to be washed or thrown out)and the elastic strap serves double duty as a second bookmark and to keep the notebook together (keeping it closed helps it survive).I like the construction and archival quality of the book. My notes look more like those of a disorganized madman than a manager (I am starting to wonder if they are synonomous) but if I ever have to refer back to them I can be assured that they will be there for a long time. It only received 4 stars because they are [...] a piece and at my current scrawling rate, I will probably need about 4 or 5 a year. Just get your company to pay for it if you can, because they are notebooks that you can rely on to be there for a long while.Lastly: For the person who likes their Montblanc notebook with tear out pages, they are partially missing the point. These books are for archiving and keeping records (of questionable usefulness in my case) not for making quick throw away notes. I also highly doubt that their notebook is as thin as one of these is either. Each have their own place
I can't decide whether I bought this notebook despite the hype or because of it. But I do know that when I have a Moleskine notebook with me, I actually write. That is reason enough for me to be a loyal customer. No more journals started, then abandoned, and no more ideas forgotten because I didn't write them down right away.I suspect that it really is despite the hype that I love it. Here's why:* As I said, I actually use it.* Delightfully smooth paper.* Nice thin lines.* A variety of styles.* Pocket in back keeps little things; in my case, it's often fortune cookie fortunes.* Elastic keeps the paper clean.* Holds up well in my pocket or bag.* Did I mention the delightfully smooth paper, with the nice thin lines?This is the first notebook that I've really been able to carry with me, and that makes all the difference as far as writing is concerned
I couldn't believe what a hard time I had trying to find a small, hardback, unlined notebook with book-like binding! I'll admit that I bought this product because it was the only one I could find that fulfilled these requirements. But I am extremely pleased with the overall quality of this notebook. I am using it to record my favorite quotes and it is perfect for that purpose thus far. The only downfalls I can say may stem from the fact that I am writing in it with a fountain pen. The ink tends to "vein out" a bit if you will and I can't write on both sides of the paper because the ink is too dark. Otherwise I love the appearance of both the cover and the paper. I can't speak for how it handles for sketching. I also like the small pocket on the inside of the back cover. With shipping it is a bit pricey, but definitely a great product
The Mokeskine notebooks are must haves for art majors. They're handy for quick sketches, laying out ideas for 2D/3D design class, keeping track of glazing formulas, class assignments, personal notes and reminders, email addresses and phone numbers, just about anything you can think of to draw or write down. The smaller ones fit in a pocket or small purse and the larger ones go nicely in your portfolio or backpack.
I use large ruled one as notebook for my arab language classes, large ruled one for work, small ruled one as vade mecum (always have it with me and use it to jot down EVERYTHING that comes to mind, addresses, phone numbers, PINs, moonphases, webpages to check, you name it), large blank paged one as BOS. I just LOVE it, its durable, elegant, compact.. and widely available in Croatia, thank God :
I work on the news for a local highschool, and i am always about writing things down. I keep 4 new molskine notebooks in my desk at all times. I uasualy keep them in my back pocket, and sitting in classes all day with the notebook in my pocket can basicly destroy it. And i have killed quite a few of them this way. But thats my fault. They are the perfect size for your back pocket and dont get in the way too much. It would be nice if they had a stronger version of the book, for thoes who are a bit tougher on their stuff, something like riveted pages to the cover. I rebind mine all of the time, but keep in mind they get thrown down staircases, dropped on the street, and chucked into trash cans by some crazy student. Basicly because im always on the move, taping events, filming movies, and everything i have so much going on i dont have time to worry about how my notebook is going to hold up, and the Moleskine line does a good job at putting up with everything i can throw at it. I use them to record my daily notes, and use them for story boarding. The cover is tough, and the elastic extremely helpful. The back pocket is very good for keeping business cards in, i can pull out a card at the same time i write a note down! :
I first encountered Moleskine notebooks in a bookstore in London this spring, and what lodged in my memory was their marketing claim to be "the legendary notebook of Hemingway," et cetera. I have since learned from various sources that those claims may be a touch exaggerated. But now that I own one myself and am starting to make daily use of it, I'm beginning to see, at least, why Moleskine notebooks have so many fans.For more than ten years, I've used a calendar/day planner/all-your-information-in-one-place system that isn't just a notebook but has an entire philosophy about how you're supposed to live your life tied into it. I never bought into that aspect of the company, but have grown used to having one reference containing all that stuff between two covers, and with a place for a pen besides. Going from that to a Moleskine, with its one small pocket in the back and no place to put a writing instrument, is definitely a switch. It's the part of the change I'm least sure about. On the other hand, the Moleskine definitely wins for portability, ease of use, style, and handiness-to-have-around in case of brainstorms.So I'm still not completely sold that this is the best of all possible notebooks. But it's definitely a good one, and I do appreciate both the attractiveness of the design and the quality of the construction. Sure, you can get a serviceable notebook for about a tenth of the price, and a whole "lifestyle system," updated annually, for quite a bit more. It's all a matter of taste, and my taste is starting to run in this direction
I am very pleased with my Moleskin Small Address Book. I can fully appreciate why Picasso and Hemingway used the Moleskin Notebooks. The quality of material used to produced my address book is clearly of the highest that can be found. What I especially liked about my small moleskin address book is that the pages are ruled for you to use as  you like, unlike other books that have designated space for street addresses or phone number. As you know sometimes all you want to do it keep the phone number while with other contacts you want to keep a biography on them, their birthdates, their children's birthdates , anniversary, email addresses etc. I think its a perfect address book. I liked it so much I bought three, one for my Mom, my sister and myself. 
The Xpad definitely is effective, but seems a bit overpriced for what it is - plastic housing with foam insulation. I use it with a TabletPC and need to tilt the entire laptop up to use sometimes. When doing so, it's not totally "non-slip" but is manageable. Also it has a very strong plastic smell that hopefully will dissipate over time. Some reviews describe the xpad as having "metal edges", but that's not the case, at least not in the current design. The edges are made of the same ABS hard plastic as the top of the pad. I don't find the edges to be uncomfortable, but suppose they could be made more rounded to improve the design
I don't keep regular hours. So I don't want a book that goes from say 8 to 6 or whatever. This great Moleskine lets you track time the way you work. You can plan your week and make lots of notes on the right hand side. I love Moleskine. I write a lot with a fountain pen and the Moleskine paper is great for fountain pens. It's the finest paper you can buy. And this is a nice, buttery soft leather book. It's not too small or too large. I keep mine on my desk but often take it from room to room as needed. Or in the car. You can't go wrong with this book. And you never go wrong with Moleskine. It's always worth the extra cost
The Avery Tripleclick is the best value stylus pen combination I've found. While I don't find the pencil particularly useful, it is occasionally handy. The pen is comfortable to write with, and the price is hard to beat.The only minor problems with it are:1) the difficulty of finding one retail. Since Amazon offers it, that's no longer a problem.2) the little cap over the eraser. It tends to come off and get lost.3) the silver paint tends to eventually wear off, leaving the white plastic underneath. I wish they offered it in black or some other plastic color without the silver paint.None of these is a show-stopper
I've had one for a year, and love it.  I bought a second one as a gift.  They are so much more convinient than a mony clip or wallet
I just received the 2007 version, and could not be happier. Like other Moleskine products, this weekly planner is of excellent quality.The layout is very simple, and the size is perfect for a purse. Each day in the week is allocated about 7 lines, with three days on one page, and four on the other (Sat and Sun share their space)I have owned notebooks of the same size (with similar leather cover), which I used daily, and have never experienced any problems with binding. Overall, this is an excellent planner!
Moleskine makes great, sturdy, compact notebooks.  It has a convenient pocket in the back for sticking scraps of paper, a photo, whatever.  I have a small ruled Moleskine I've used for years as a general purpose notebook.  It's taken quite a beating, but still looks to last until it's full.  Since I purchased that first book at the Smithsonian in 2002, I've purchased, used and abused several different styles of Moleskines.  Each exhibits the same high level of quality, from the sturdy cover, strong, durable elastic 'clasp', and tough, heavy paper.
Does your bank now refuse to count coins? You can buy funnels or counters or just load these sleeves yourself. I carry a tube of quarters around in my purse for the car wash (it needs $5 in quarters.) I also take these to my bank. If you have kids, this is fun; get them to count out and load the sleeves. You will be surprised how much coin you have at home; it can add up to a nice dinner out for the whole family
This Parker pen, especially with the optional gel refill, is a stylish, classy pen that looks at least as good as some of those other, more expensive pens, and writes very well, with very little leakage. As a left hander, I also appreciate the quick drying ink and the left-handed friendliness of the pen. The pen is also quite durable, and the refills are readily available at most office stores. Incidentally, the pens are made in thesame U.K. factory that manufactured Valentine pens, with the same quality. This pen lives up to its legacy, unlike some of those other pens that have become nothing but cheaply made, expensively priced knock-offs of themselves. Oh, and by the way, these cost a tenth of the price of those other pens. This pen, the Pilot G7 and its family of products and the Pentel EnerGel are my big three at this point.
A very stylish way for the business professional to carry his or her passport
Stylish, small, lightweight, loud.  Got it for my father. The look on my mothers face when he opened was worth 10X the price of this gem
This is my very first experience with a trimmer.  I was aiming to the plastic made products with the replaceable cutters, but I recall my school had an old beat up trimmer and it seemed to still cut good.  So I went with the wooden type and self-sharpening blade.  The quality is great.  It's very light to carry.  Plus, it cuts perfect
This Laboratory Notebook is excellent for those who require verifiable notes for any type of laboratory work and experiment recording and authenticity
I was worried about the quality of this product considering the low price.  I am very happy with the quality. I didn't select this model because magnets will stick, but it turns out to be a handy feature.  I am delighted with this whiteboard
This is an incredibly high quality pen for the price, especially when used with the gell ink refills that are avaiable
Outstanding product.  Never been so organized and the boxes look great.  I will buy more when these boxes are filled
This pen needs gel ink to make it perfect.  The regular ink is often difficult to get flowing.  But it does the job.  PenAgain products were the only ones that caused me no pain after surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome and tennis elbow
The seller was amazing. I ordered two and received them by the next day. The pen writes very smooth and flawlessly. Would definitely recommend. I do wish this wrote a little thinner though
I am a nurse in a very busy ED and have had multipul hand surgeries it is painful to say the least to write at times this pen has given me back the ease of writing all over againthank you so much.Just one draw back do not I repeat do not let anyone play with the pen again the device breaks easily when put in the write mode it retracts very easily after it is broken
I love this thing. I open most of my kids toys with it plus anything else in a plastic package. It is so simple so fast and just a brilliant tool to use. Forget using scissors or knives you can really get hurt. The Pyranna is safe, fast and easy. Thanks for making a great product
I was so surprised when I opened this box of cards because the quality of the cards is excellent.  The cards are unique, but appropriate for many occasions
Just as good as HP's.  No skips, or smears.  Two thumbs up
HP was the first paper I tried when I started making t-shirts.  It cracked, so I got "commercial" iron-on paper.  That cracked  too.  My supplier told me the iron had to be hot enough, and I had to press hard, putting my weight behind it (that's alot of weight... haha). So I bought a new iron, set it at the hottest setting, and I pressed each part of the transfer for the same length of time and I pressed hard.  But I started burning the transfers because the new iron was TOO hot.  So I set it a hair under the highest cotton setting (instead of all the way up to linen), and it was just right.  (For a whole sheet transfer, I first iron around the transfer to set it down; then I press in increments of about three inches for five long seconds, all the way across, making about four or five rows of presses to get from the top to the bottom, and then start all over again going up and down, making four or five rows of presses to get from one side to the other.  I press and lift, rather than pushing. When I'm done pressing, I move the iron in a kind of circular pattern all around the transfer again, pressing firmly.  Then I lift up one edge and peel it back a ways to check the tranfser.  If it looks good, I warm it up again where I'm going to peel, and then start peeling, and let the iron follow me so the transfer doesn't cool down as I'm peeling so I don't get shiny edges. Phew what a pain in the ***.) Anyways, just when I really got the hang of it, my supplier let me down and I couldn't get my professional paper in time for the weekend.  SO I WENT BACK TO THE HP, USING THE SAME TECHNIQUE.  It burned the first time, and so I set the iron about a half a number under what I had it set at before, and didn't iron it quite as long.  It looked really good, but I wanted to see if the transfer was strong enough, so instead of waiting, I threw it right in the washer (inside out, cold water, no bleach; knits-delicates setting on the dryer).  I was surprised how soft it was!  I couldn't even tell it was a transfer, and the color was good!  SO IT WASN'T THE HP THAT WAS THE PROBLEM INITIALLY, IT WAS ME.  If you're gonna use this stuff (or any iron-on transfer), the best thing I can tell you is to experiment on an old shirt.  Try the hottest setting first, and turn it down if it burns.  (You'll know you've burned when you see something like a tea stain on your shirt, it feels a bit fuzzy, and you'll see part of your graphic is left behind on the transfer paper when you peel it off - I think that's because instead of the ink going into the shirt, it burns back into the paper.)  Be sure to count the seconds and make sure every inch of the transfer gets an even, HARD press.  I FOUND THE CRACKING IS MAINLY DUE TO THE IRON  NOT BEING HOT ENOUGH, AND NOT PRESSING DOWN HARD ENOUGH.  THE POLYMERS GOTTA BE SQOOSHED INTO THE FABRIC.  Also, I iron onto a nice smooth piece of wood, and I don't use a pillow case or anything between the shirt and the wood, and I stretch the shirt very slightly and tuck it in so it doesn't move when I iron.  Then I let the shirt cool down slowly, before I take it off the wood (thinking if it cools down too fast, that might make it crack more). Before I got the new iron, I was ironing with a piece of sheet metal on top of the wood to conduct heat.  That was better, but the new iron, getting the temperature right, and ironing hard and evenly, did the trick for me. 
I loved this so much that I am buying one for each of several friends.  It is beautifully made, functional, and works perfectly. Thank you so much for offering this, Amazon. Thank you Woodform for making them!
I have a number of shredders and bought this one mainly for it's capacity to destroy CDs and DVDs. It does an excellent job of that. It literally destroys them and they're totally useless and forever lost. The same for credit cards and small amounts of paper --- although I wouldn't buy it for paper as there are other machines far superior for that.I did, however, have a disappointment with the unit. It simply balked at taking a diskette. It's advertised that it destroys these. And it does if you can get it through the throat.Fortunately not many people use these anymore but I have some old ones I wanted to get rid of and was not happy with the results I got from this unit in my one attempt to get a floppy through. I plan to call tech support and see if I had misunderstood something or done something wrong.The floppy finally did get through but only after jamming and balking. Once through, it was destroyed totally.For CDs and DVDs, I highly recommend this little unit. It's very powerful and Royal has good and fast tech support. I own another of their small shredders and found that to be so.[...
Never assume colored pencils are for children. Never assume that a cheap art item is a poor quality art item. Crayola, for me, are best known as the most afforadable and widely ranged set of pencils on the market. They have hard lead that gives very smooth laydown. With these pencils, it is always best to start out light and layer your colors until you get a sleek, natural result. The problem with Crayola is that the lead is too hard for blending,  i.e, 'pushing' the colors into one another. If you are the type of artist who is into such things, I suggest Prismacolor pencils. But you can mix a little with a white Crayola pencil, so give it a try if you like.Overall, wonderful for hardcore traditional artists or beginning scribblers. It definately won't burn a hole in your pocket.
I've recently swapped from sitting at a desk (which I have done for nearly 20 years) to working at a "stand-up" desk. I found that standing on office carpets, even while wearing comfortable shoes, was tough - I would barely last 5 to 10 minutes. And the accumulative effects were enough that I doubted I would get acclimatized anytime soon.Having tried this mat for a week now, I found that I can stand on it for 20 minutes or more at a time straight away. And even at the end of the 20 minutes my feet don't feel bad - I am just sitting at that point because I am sick of standing, not because I have to sit.Rather than move the mat out of the way, I am allowing my chair to roll over it. It is not conducive to rolling (being a high chair I don't have the leverage to move it much even on the normal carpet - on the mat I have no hope). When I move the chair away, I can see definite indents in the mat where the wheels were, however these spring back within 5 minutes or so.This has been an excellent purchase as far as I am concerned
I've been using this model pen for over 15 years.  I started using this pen when I was in the military, where my job required me to transcribe live, foreign language radio transmissions.  My colleagues and I tried many different brands and models of pens, and for me this pen offered the best performance.  When speed is essential you learn to write small and the Extra Fine point is perfect.  Over the years I've noticed some problems with this pen, but nothing bad enough to make me choose another pen.  After beginning to use a new pen, if you leave it tip up for a long time (several months) it stops working.  Also, it is necessary to use a lighter touch with this pen. If you press too hard the tip will bend and if it bends too much the pen will be useless, so using this pen in a rough environment, i.e. trying to write while in a vehicle that is driving off-road, is not recommended.I still keep my eye out and try new pens every so often, but I keep coming back to the Pilot Precise V5 Extra Fine Point
I BOUGHT THIS PEN FOR MYSELF, BUT ENDED UP GIVING IT TO MY DAUGHTER WHO IS COLLEGE STUDENT AND A GREAT WRITER. A LIFETIME OF WRITING, SINCE I GOT THE REFILLABLE CARTRIDGE TOO. IN A WORLD INCREASINGLY DEVOTED TO EMAILS AND BALL POINTS, WORSE STILL DISPOSABLE FOUNTAIN PENS -- ISN'T THAT SORT OF A CONTRADICTION?? -- THE LAMY OFFERS AN AFFORDABLE WRITING STYLE AND A GREAT, I MEAN GREAT, GRIP. I NEVER KNEW IT MATTERED SO MUCH UNTIL I HELD A PEN THAT WAS PROPERLY DESIGNED. I THINK I'LL HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER FOR MYSELF, IRRESISTIBLE.
My daughter is 7 years old and can do this by herself with no problems.  It came with three framed art works.  She crunched them and then hung them up in her room.  Very cute!  Fun bright colors and very easy to use.  One of the things I liked best about this craft is that it wasn't messy!  That's a huge plus for me as a parent
I bought this clock last week. Amazon was prompt in shipping it on time.On having received it I place the AA battery in the clock selected the time zone place it on the wall after some time the clock second hand and hour hand started moving fast. It is actually searching for the signal. If it gets it immediately the time will be set accurately in 5 minutes. If not every hour the clock searches for the accurate time relayed from the colorado server. The clock finds the time signal within the next 4-5 hours. The chances of the clock finding the signal is high over night when there is less distortion. Once ir receives the accurate time it will never fall behind. A very good time piece
This little scraper will get your grill cleaner than just soaking it in the sink.  It scrubs all the excess off with ease and leaves even the dirtiest grill clean.  Sturdier than any other brush I or my family has used.  The one we have now has lasted quite a long time.  It cleans each rail on the grate beautifully.  The wood on the handle will become dirty so keep it clean
I found no issues.  I put the battery in and hit "ET" it set and is keeping GREAT time
Keeps the ribs from searing. Lower profile than most rib racks so it is easier to turn rib
Used it for a tri-tip last night and it came out wonderfully.  Cranked on high to initially heat it up, then we left it on low and it kept the 400+ degrees no problem (it actually got too hot according to my instant read thermometer!).Some of the complaints here say that the burner is too loose.  That's because they used the wrong washer to mount it!  There's one washer that's larger than the others.  Use the wrong one and it'll be loose
It works in New Jersey, just wait a night before you say something else
The brush does a good job of loosening grit and grime from your grill, but you are still going to have to break down and wash the grill with soap and water now and then.  The brush has a strong wooden handle, leather loop, a sturdy set of bristles, and a grill scraper for tough jobs.  Be sure to buy this longer brush as the 12-inch one does not have the reach, especially for larger grills
Really goes good in my room. I really like that it automatically synchronise as per the time zone and daytime savings...
The description doesn't do this rib rack justice.  This thing is pretty big and will hold a LOT of chicken.  You will certainly not complain about running out of room!  Even though it might be an exaggeration to think it can hold enough chicken to feed the entire neighborhood, there's enough room here to hold enough chicken for a family of 7 or 8.  Washing it may be a problem.  Just wash it immediately after using it
I use a table top grill about 65 days a year.  The only one I can depend on is the Weber.  The only reason I replace it is when mine get stolen
Had enough of cheap looking patio umbrellas that tear and bend after 3 or so thunderstorms?  Try this one!  Very nice design,looks great, simulated wood finish pole, easy open and close. We are very satisfied
This is the most awesome, wonderful, fantastic grill there is out there.  Everyone knows charcol can't be beat for flavor, but it's a bummer to get started.  Weber has outdone themselves by inventing this amazing grill. It is super easy to start the coals, easy to keep clean and looking fabulous, easy to empty the ashes, and easy move around the deck (out of our frequent Seattle rain).  And of course the food we grill comes out delectable.  I am grilling a whole chicken tonight using the indirect method.  A snap with this grill!  It is well worth the price.  WE LOVE IT!!   
I bought this grill set for my fiance.  He absolutely loved them.  They are heavy and extremely sturdy.  I would definitely recommend them!
I've used a lot of grill covers in my time.  This is the best - looks like it will outlast the last few I've tried that just couldn't make it through a year in the hot Arkansas sun!  Colors are neutral though green is more of an olive - but I didn't buy it for the color - bought it for the durability - course 6 months a trial does not make
I've used my smoker for 7 years now and I have nothing but great things to say about it. One recomendation is to drill a small hole in the top and insert a metal stem thermometer (about $7) for accurate monitoring of the smoking. You'll get the best results when you can hold the temps at the desired levels. It also comes in handy for checking internal temps of the meat.After 7 years, the heating element broke and new ones are $40 through Char Broil. I'm appalled that they're so much, and am contemplating buying another smoker instead.
This grill has it all, six burners, a side burner, a rotisserie with infrared burner and a smoker box with a dedicated burner.  The grill grates are 3/8" stainless steel rods that provide great grill marks on your food.  The grill heats up to 600 degrees in less than 10 minutes, but it does burn through propane rather quickly, but that wouldn't be any different with any 60,000 BTU grill.  I was able to put the grill together by myself in a little over an hour.  The fit of the pieces was fantastic and the end result was an attractive incredibly stable grill.  It has two pull-up counters with stainless steel inserts, and a cabinet with stainless doors.So far I have made countless steaks, dogs and chicken breasts that all came out the same due to the even temperature on the grill.  My old Charbroil would give me two raw breasts, two good breasts, and two overcooked breasts... not with this grill.  I have also slowed cooked some ribs with the smoker box going and the meat fell off the bone.  But, the best meal yet was a rotisserie chicken that I prepared with a rub and injected with a marinade.  The skin was crispy and the meat was tender and juicy.   We'll be making many more of those chickens in the future.Weber is a known commodity.  They are built to last, and given the quality of the components (with care) I expect this grill to last at least 15 years.  Many people end up having to get rid of their Weber's after 10, 12, 15 years because the cart has rusted out, but that's not an issue with this grill as the cart is constructed of 304 stainless steel.All in all, a great grill that will last a long time.  My only cons would be the propane consumption and maybe the size.  It's probably a little too big for me and my family, but it was the only Weber that had all the features I wanted (mainly the rotisserie and the smoker box with burner).  If they had a four burner model with those options I would have gotten that, but alas the Weber Summit Platinum D4 does not exist
I purchased this grill for my husband four years ago and we are still very happy with it.  It has held up very well.  When we were having problems with it lighting the back burner, I called customer service and they were extremely helpful.  They saved me buying a whole new burner set by explaining to me how to remove the tubes, check and clean them.  We are now replacing the racks and flavorizer bars ($60.00) since they are just too hard to clean after all this time.  I have found replacement parts at Home Depot and Lowes which is a plus to know I can easily get the parts.  I don't see us haveing to buy a new grill anytime in the near future
Well I like the cover, but I it is hard to put on.  I hoped that it would slip over the grill easily.  It does not, it is a tight fit.  The quality of the cover is excellent.  I just wish they made it a little larger so that it would go over the grill easier
I thought these grates weren't good enough to sears meat, boy was I Wrong. The beautiful lines on the meats got me great reviews from my guests. Easy to clean too
This thing works great. I prefer to keep bottled beer on hand so I never had a chance to make beer can chicken. The chicken I cooked came out perfect. Crispy skin and juicy inside. Excellent! I'm going to dry lemon juice and wine next time. The bottom tray holds all the grease so your grill stays clean. Highly recommended
The umbrella I ordered is fine, just what I had hoped it would be. However, I subsequently ordered an umbrella stand (after you prompted me to do so) and when it arrived the two tightening screws  in the shaft had been damaged in shipment. Each of the screws have plastic knobs and the knobs were broken off. As a result when one tightens them the broken plastic is sharp enough to cut skin. I have tried unsuccessfully to find replacements at a hardware store.  Any suggestions
I heard that this grill was "only" 36000 btu, and was not as hot as some other grills.  Believe me, this puppy is plenty hot if all you are going to do is cook food!  Disregard this btu rating.  This btu rating is rubbish.  This grill will transfer so much heat to your food so fast that if you're not used to cooking with a high-quality grill you will turn your beautiful porterhouses into charchol (I used a custom-cut 3-inch porter house to break in my new grill, and to my surprise, it was closer to well done than I prefer, but still DELICIOUS!)  Everything is high-quality.  It is much more solid than all the other grills I looked at, and the grill is very even in terms of heating.  Besides, it is beautiful.  The side burner was not something I was really interested in, but I just went for it.  I used it the first time.  THIS is the grill you need
You may wonder why it took me 20 years to write this review... well after using this rotisserie for all that time, the motor finally stopped working.  So, I got a new motor this week.  And I'm ready to go.I have cooked just about anything you can put on a stick.  As everyone says, the results are just phenomenal.  I've done 16-21 LB turkeys, standing rib roasts, Leg 'o lamb, pork roasts, chickens, duck, goose, you name it, I've cooked it. Just put the food on, add a few hot brickets every so often, and let her go.One tip, there are two ways to cook with this.  If you want even heating, don't take the lid off too often. Releasing the heat with the lid off you lose the "convection" effect, but that's not all bad. For some meats, like leg of lamb, where you want the outside crisp, keeping the lid off works well if you stoke your fire to keep it hot.Finally, Weber's customer service is phenomenal
This pest repeller works great in my attic repelling squirrels.  The squirrels have broken in three times and are gone within 15 minutes.  I would not use this inside the house because it does make a constant chirp sound.  I can't hear this noise in the attic, so I will buy another when this wears out. 
This a very basic smoker.  It is well built.  Easy to assemble w/ good instructions.  Not much information on the actual smoking process but the internet is full of information. No information on how to adjust the vent to make it run cooler or hotter.  Do not think it should matter w/ gas.  It might just regulate the amount of smoke.  I leave mine 1/2 open.Runs to hot for a smoker when set as the instructions recommended, gas valve 1.5 turns open.  I have mine less than 1/3 of a turn open to achieve 225deg. It took some trial and error to figure out how to get the temp low but once you figure it out the gas smoker works great.Would have been 5 stars if knob on the smoker was able to adjust the temp low enough.  I keep mine pegged on low
I bought the Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker for my first smoker and the first time I used it, I cooked two Pork Boston Butt's. I have never used a smoker before and I was worried about the heat fluxuating,(I think thats how you spell it),alot. Once I got the heat set(in about 20 minutes) I put the two pork butt's on and left it till the next morning. I woke up and checked the temp and it was perfect. Everyone who had some of my smoked pork thought I was a proffesional at smoking with my Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker. I am doing some beef brisket this weekend to see how it turns out. Alot of people have been saying that thier Smoker was in bad shape because of the packing from the manufacturer but the Smoker I bought from Lowe's was packed in a cardboard box with foam supporting everything and nothing was damaged or scratched on my Smoker. I would recommend this Smoker for anyone that wants a Very Good and easy to use Smoker. OH Yeah' It's also easy to clean!
My husband was very pleased with this set.  It is the best one yet.  The handles are great to grip and the set is easy to use.  They wash clean easily. This is a great product.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves to grill
After assembling the stand I was very pleased with my decision to purchase this one.  I also ordered an extension, thinking that for my Mayan family hammock I would need to make it longer.  But to my surprise, the hammock fit perfectly without the extension, and because the height of the stand can be adjusted pretty high, you could put a longer hammock in it because of this.  Very heavy steel, well enameled, excellent workmanship and very easy to assemble.  ***** - Definitely a five star purchase
This was a replacement clock for one that fell off the kitchen wall. I was very familiar with this clock since I had the original one for almost 3 years. I like the look of this clock and I like the choices you have for different displays. Overall this is a sweet clock. I did not however give this clock 5 stars because when you try and "program" this clock it won't do what you want it to do, not sure if it how the owners manual is written, or whether the manual is out of date with changes in how to adjust the features
I ordered this clock for my Dad and he loves it. It is so easy to see the time on the ceiling and it keeps the correct time automatically. The indoor temp. is a nice addition. And the price is right
Just got to use the Weber Baby Q griddle. It worked great. The only complaint I have is that it could be bigger. It covers just a little over half of the available grill area. More would be better.Other than that, the design is excellent and it works great
The product work perfectly, and the displays are very good.Beaufiful and modern design
I ordered this on a friday and it was delivered the following weds. The base is heavy. The colors are very "in" now. A distressed Oil Rubbed Bronze pol and base with a taupe fabric.  Very nice. The umbrella opens and closes with a wind up handle. It is solid and put together well.  The fabric is thick and provides good shade on my SOUTH-SOUTHWEST facing rear lanai.  It was very easy to put together.  I am happy with my purchase of this set.  A++++++++++++++
These lounge chairs are hands down the best deal that I have found. They are extremely comfortable, sturdy and attractive! Plus free shipping and they come already assembled..which is a big deal for me since I am not very handy!! Great item and great deal all around
Purchased this so my 7-year old can wake up on his own for school.  I checked several stores and was dissapointed to find nothing suitable for a child (didn't want radio, CD, telephone, and other features).** Pros **1. Very compact size, fits good next to bed2. AC adapter with battery backup (even came with batteries)3. LCD display doesn't have annoying illumination while trying to sleep.  Blue "glow" activates only when very easy to find button is pressed4. Straight forward buttons and controls that took about 2-3 minutes for my 7-year old to learn.  Buttons are a good size and are not real hard to press.5. Great styling as a kids clock6. The projection feature is a BIG hit.  Projects about 4" high numbers on ceiling.7. Projection intensity is good for laying in bed at night without lighting up the whole room8. Decent construction for the $$$** Cons **1. None for my particular applicationNOTE: If you are looking for a projection clock to use during the day (visible projection in sunlight), you will be extremely disappointed
Well, look no further.  My apartment complex doesn't allow any type of charcol or gas grills but electric is allowed.  I was going crazy trying to find one that would fit my George Forman Kettle Grill - I didn't want to lug it in and out all summer.  So, I took a gamble and ordered this grill cover and it fits perfectly! I can now leave my George Forman Kettle Grill on my deck and not have to worry about the elements
I've had this wireles temperature station for about 2 months now and I'm very happy with it.  I mounted the wireless sensor in my outdoor screened porch to both keep it dry and out of the direct sunlight (direct sunlight would likely result in innacurately high readings).  The "base" station is usually in our kitchen, but for a while I moved it around different rooms of our house to see how much the indoor temperature varies from room to room - the outdoor sensor never "lost contact" with the base.  The indoor temp reading is accurate and is within 1-2 degrees of 2 thermostats I have in the house, and the outdoor temp is accurate with 1-2 degrees of an outdoor mounted thermometer that is also in the screened porch.  I enjoy the convenience of quickly and easily knowing what the outdoor temp is in the morning.This product works as advertised and I'm very happy with it.  Enjoy
We had out of town guests arriving when our puppy had chewed our chaise lounge to shreds.  We ordered this chaise lounge cushion and it was sent to us immediatly, w/o special instructions to do so.  When we received it, it was a bit thinner than I wanted, but for the price and fast delivery, it was great!!!  The material is durable and of good quality.  Our kids have been laying on it with swimming pool water dripping off them and it's been out in the weather for 4 weeks and shows no wear.  Like I said, it's a bit thinner than I wanted, but a good buy
They are very attractive and we had no trouble putting them together.  Our only complaint - the stain ran during a rain storm and stained our patio
It was more than I expected. It was easy to hang, looks good, and most of all it is as comfortable as advertised. Too bad I don't have more places to hang more hammocks
  great cover, heavy and well made.  fit's perfect.  it didn't come with any bourbon or beer though.  I was dissappointed
My family and I love "beer can" chicken but I didn't like the idea of literally putting my food onto a beer can.  This Weber Poultry Roaster is so much cleaner and far easier than using a beer can.  The chicken remains stable too...no more trying to balance the chicken on a beer can.  And it's a great way to switch from using beer to using wine.  What a fabulous product
It took a long while to get this one, but it is entirely worth the wait. This hammock is wide/long and gets a high score for comfort. One thing I didn't know was that the hanging kit (hooks/chains) for this hammock has to be purchased separately (costs about $15). Despite that, I have to say that it is a great buy for its price
This is an easy device to set-up; it works great! I am very pleased with this produc
I was able to reach the top of the windows in my two story foyer with this wonderful product. I need to point out I am 5'4".  I did need the assistance from my boyfriend (who is 6'1") to reach the ceiling to remove the cobwebs...but he did it and they are GONE!  I just received my Simple Clean today and I have already tried three attachments. The ceiling fan attachment worked well. I used the duster to dust my window panes in my foyer as well as my fragile lighting. LOVED IT! We also used the spider web remover and it was great! I recommend this product to everyone!
excellent product: my third experienced with Oregon Scientific products.Simple to set up, and accurat
I needed a big table to put my CPU, keyboard, screen and printer with room for papers and prints. The 8ft Lifetime table is perfect for my needs. It is sturdy, neat, attractive and portable. A must have for every home office. 
Works great.  I have wanted a projection clock for quite some time. This one works wonderfully and the cost was wonderful also. I still have not installed the outside sensor as I'm trying to find the "perfect" location.You can't go wrong with this one
Heavy duty and sturdy cover.  Attachment to wheel to keep from blowing away in wind is great.  Vent pockets and storage pocket also very handy
I am finding the batteries are doing better than most rechargeables I have bought.  Seem to have a good battery life.  No leaking problems.  If I did, I would just return
We bought our Performer about 2 years ago from our local hardware store. It was the best purchase we ever made! Its a beautiful thing to have a charcoal grill with a gas ignition....about 15-20 minutes you're ready to grill. For the people who own a gas grill and are considering the Performer but are concerned about dealing with charcoal...its a piece of cake (we had our reservations too!) and you're going to wish you switched sooner. Food never tasted so good
This table with its adjustable height was just what I needed.  It's strong, easy to adjust, and stable after it's set up.   
I love my Brinkman's Smoker. But I did some modifications to get it in its present state:The offset firebox arrangement: Using plain old charcoal will cost you a fortune! When I first got this as a Christmas present, I found this out quick! I went thru a whole 20 pound bag of Kingsford. Too costly! So what I did was to buy a propane tank and a propane burner. I ran the burner's metal intake connector out the Brinkman's air intake vent. Perfect fit! The vent also held up one end of the propane burner. Then I placed a regular brick inside the firebox to support the other side of the propane burner.I now have all the heat I want, cheaply and also I now have pretty good temperature control! I also agree with another poster that the optional temperature gauge placed in the Brinkman's cutout is a waste of money and would be inaccurate. I did it and regret buying that thing. However do get a remote smoker temperature unit that gives you two separate temperature probes and readings. This way you can monitor both meat and internal smoker temps without opening the huge smoking chamber lid which would waste all your heat and smoke! And speaking of smoke......it drove me crazy figuring out how to make a sustained source of smoke that wouldn't snuff out the propane burner in the process! Here is what I did to solve this new problem:Take off that "Hobbit" external smoke stack. Then take off the flimsy end cap that holds the swivel lid of the exhaust vent. With a drill, carefully make an 1/8 inch hole thru the welded on rod the end cap was attached to. Replace the lid. Now, take a tie-wire or maybe a cotter pin and put that into the hole you just made so that the swivel lid won't fall off as you invert it.......invert it??? Yes, invert it. See, you will be stuffing hickory wood blocks into this inverted pipe. The part with the swivel lid will be placed directly onto the propane burner. The end of the smoke stack should be positioned into the smoking chamber. This way as smoke is produced, the smoke will go directly into the chamber NOT THE FIRE BOX which if it did would snuff out the propane burner! And speaking of hickory smoke......don't buy chips! It is too costly! Buy instead Hickory wood BLOCKS. I buy mines from Home Depot in large bags for super cheap! I use my small axe to carefully size the hickory blocks so that it fits snuggly into the inverted smoke stack. Works like magic. Oh, one more thing......place another Hickory wood BLOCK you carefully sized into the now stubby smoking chamber's exhaust pipe, where the smoke stack used to attach to. The wood block will block just enough so that most of the smoke stays inside the chamber and the wood block will allow just enough air flow so that the offset firebox's propane burner will get its air.There you have it. The perfect smoker that is cheap to operate and effective at generating smoke! And don't forget to place a metal pot ontop of the propane burner that is full of water. You need this boiling to create the needed steam for your smoker's performance
After a few years of use, the original rack on my Gold C grill was rusty and unusable. This is the exact replacement and fits like the original, making the grill that much more usuable again.
Set up was easy. Just read the manual and follow the instructions. Don't take short cuts.Forcasting is excellent after setting the barometer to match local conditions. We live over 1,000 feet above sea level. Adjusting for that was needed. Weather.com's zip code oriented barometric pressure info made that relatively easy.The screen is easy to read and understand. The main unit has a solid feel and does not look cheap.The external humidity and temperature sensor fits easily between a closed window and it's screen.The manual could be more complete. It wasn't clear that the icon that depicts a connection with the national time service doesn't appear until after the first connection is made in the wee hours of the morning. When you manually set the clock make sure you do it in 24 hour mode. Then, switch to 12 hour mode if that is what you want displayed. Again, the manual should have pointed that out
This lounge/deck chair cushon is worth every penny. It is thick, comfortable (none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion), available in several color choices, and has a soft, not plasticky, cover fabric. You will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit. It just barely fit my 'titanic' deck chair because I had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms. But all turned out well and I must say I am very happy with it. It is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper, but much thinner, types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer. Get the best. This is it
Weber discontinued it and Amazon no longer has it.  My pal has a condo with a balcony (not large) this is the Weber for her - equip it with ONE charcoal rail and you get lots of indirect heat for smoking.  Usually the 14 inch Smokey Joe's are too small, often my 22 inch Performer is too big, but this Jumbo Joe is just right.Weber - Bring it back!!
Took it out of the box. 7 minutes later I was watching the weather, inside and out. Would recommend highly
We bought this for an intelligent 95 year old woman who wanted lots of information at her finger tips. She knows immediately the date, time, day of the week and weather prediction. It is very ugly but does the job perfectly!!
This durable grill mat does an excellent job.  The product's material absorbs grease without burning or warping.  In my opinion, what I like best about it is that it catches and holds the majority of solid particles which fall from the grill (which turn into hard-to-clean stains just as often as grease).  It is very easy to clean.  I highly recommend this product
These herbs are too young to taste yet, but they are coming along!  I previously grew the salad greens, which thrived, but weren't as handy as having fresh herbs growing, especially when one considers the high prices of fresh herbs at the grocery store.  I am just trying to be patient and check out the growth on a daily basis
Nice good looking grill, good price with free shipping.4 stars for minor bends from shipment. Arrived two days earlier than scheduled. Clear instructions, you can put it together in less than an hour.Cooks nice, cleans easy.Recomended
I am impressed with this product. All the parts were clearly marked. All the parts were included in the box. The directions were excellent. No complaints here
Oregon Scientific atomic projection clocks are great.  I have three of these closcks and am looking forwared to buying 2 more
Larger than I expected and thick/heavy.  Good quality and definately worth the price.
I bought this for my husband in December, we put it in December 25 (we have an acre for our back yard) with about 40 mole holes....the ground has been freezing on and off, and we put one in the middle of an old "hole".... Takes 3 D batteries and believe it or not the thing is STILL vibrating (sounds kind of irritating if your close) but who cares....beats the back yard looking like a new cemetery. NO NEW HOLES...you could chew more "Juicy Fruit" which the kids love to help out with for our small front yard, but that only lasts you about 3 weeks....I"m buying another for the front yard
This pizza cooker works really well.  I have a grill large enough to use 4 at a time.   A couple of hints for using the cooker ;turn pan 180 degrees ocationally for more even cooking and when dough is just starting to get firm, slide a non stick spatula under to lift dough out of the holes in the pan.                                                                                         
I paid $200 and free shipping for two chairsthey look like they are worth at least twice that amountglad I ordered them
I picked up this smoker at Lowes for a lot less than Amazon.  I also bought an inexpensive cover with elastic that works just fine.  Overall this is a good smoker.  Assembly took a while since the handles didn't match up with the holes on the smoker body and lid so I had to hammer at the handles a bit to get them to fit.  Otherwise assembly was easy.The food thus far has come out great.  I have done salmon twice.  I was smoking in 30 and 40 degree weather and the fish took the normal 2 hour smoke time.  Once it was heated and smoking the temperature stayed between 200-250 degrees.  I'm sure it will do turkey breasts and brisket just as well also.I would recomend this to anyone who wants a fair priced entry level smoker
I thought the bench was a very good buy for the money.  It fits perfectly on a small area of our deck
I purchased the 300 pack of glow bracelets for our high school group to use as a fundraiser (selling at football games).  It came out to about .06 cents per piece.  What several of the kids were then doing was combining 3 of them to make a glow necklace (there are little clear plastic connectors that come with them so you can do that). The combined price of .18 cents far beats the price you get glow necklaces for at Oriental Trading ($1.00 each).  And you can't really tell the difference between using 3 glow bracelets and 1 necklace.  Would recommend these for kids birthday parties, fundraiser, church parties, etc.
The best sprouter I've found.  Does a great job of growing sprouts, but very overpriced for its cheap quailty and build.
I love how well it works. It heats up nicely, does its job, and I am satisfied. My only problem is the igniter. It stopped working and I replaced it. Even then, it still doesn't seem to engage when I press the button. I don't get it. I'm confused. Help a brotha out.For now, I am using one of those long-neck lighters.  :(
We bought 2 of these chairs used at a garage sale, after longing for the full-priced versions at stores.  We love these chairs, but given they had had a lot of use before we bought them, one of the chairs broke recently b/c of the cords fraying over time.  The good news is that I easily ordered replacement cords online by just searching on google for Lafuma replacement cords-  and for $19, I will have a like-new chair again (rather than replacing the chair for $150+).  So for those of you worried about the durability feature of the cording, worry no more
I'm so excited to use this table. The weather has been rainy ever since I got it. It assembled beautifully. Comes w/ it's own little tool. It's a nice strong, sturdy table but it's not overly heavy. I was able to move all the pieces to the patio and assemble w/o any help. It's going to get a lot of use this summer
This is a wonderful dutch oven...I hemed and hawed between the more pricey Lodge Logic (which my other cast iron pans are) and this Bayou Classis...Thrift won out, and I bought this one. I am not disappointed in any way.  It was easy to season, and makes an unbeatable pot roast
Very easy to remove old igniter and install this one on my Weber Spirit 500 grill.  Took about 5 minutes and started up on the first push of the button.  No more trying to light a match and stick it through the hole on a windy/cold day
I bought this item after being bit in the face by a spider while I was sleeping.  It was not a pleasant experience!  We stirred them up after poking around in the attic during an afternoon.  I was finding the nasty buggers everywhere until I got this unit.  Since plugging the Bugfighter in, I've not seen a spider, or any insects, on any of the 3 levels of my home.  I have one in the basement and one in the upstairs hallway.  They've been running about 2 months now.  We've even re-checked the attic, and not a spider to be found.  I'm in Northern VA and we're coming into Spring now.  It will be interesting to see what happens.  Usually I get crickets and a bout with ants and termites as the season kicks off.  If I don't post an update, you know all went well and there were no insect battles this year.  If I have ants and/or termites...you'll be the 1st to know!Specific point...no noticeable change in electric bill for 2 months of use. 
I bought this to fill with sands and candles for an indoor area. It creates a cozy and warm addition when we watch movies and sports. The cover is a nice protective from the kids touching the candles. The sand protectes the fire pit from getting to warm.
I have an electric range and a propane bar-b-q.This burner has been very useful and was the least costly alternative to accomplishing what I wanted to do.I make 10 qts of salsa wo heating up the kitchen.A turkey roaster I bought as an accessory really works well with the burner.My cousin likes to fry potatoes and chicken wings.  This burner can really put out the heat
Item arrived very soon after ordering using the free shipping option.Product is of very good quality manufactured by Weber -- not a look alike manufactured somewhere by someone you have never heard of
VERY satisfied with the performance of this meter. Have been looking for a Relative Humidity meter for some time that was accurate and durable. The temperature is also included which is great. Price is VERY good for what you get !!
Despite the fact that this clock hangs in my basement rec room in Cincinnati, it has had no problem receiving the time signal from Colorado. It should be noted, though, that, as the manual mentions, the proximity of a powered-up TV or computer monitor can interfere with reception of the signal.As an owner of some expensive acoustic guitars, I find the hydrometer readout very useful for monitoring room humidity. And the readout is big enough to be easily visible from across the room.I only wish this thing looked a little less purely utilitarian. Big and clunky, two-tone silver, it adds nothing to my room aesthetically.  
What is bad to say about these great grates? Uniform heat, easier cleaning than the cheaper porcelain grates, and a great replacement/upgrade for my 4 year old Weber. With these and new flavorizer bars, I plan on many more years of use for this grill. My only wish is that they were a little cheaper on Amazon--price didn't beat local prices by much and only super saver shipping made it a deal
After having my Silver B for 7 years, the origional porcelin bars were very rusty. My grill would flare up terribly. I thought it might be from the rust holding the drippings and grease and making the flares worse. I was right! These stainless units (the length is listed wrong here) are great! I just cooked brauts without a flare up! Price was great; thanks Amazon
We have had this for along time now.  It works great.  It hasn't rusted or needed parts or repairs.  If you are thinking about getting one but are concerned about the price . . . just buy this one the better product
The back panel broke when taking it out of package, that is the packaging though not the clock.  It is in working order and keeps one 'on time'
Excellent service, ontime delivery, perfect match for my grill.  Thanks for the detailed descriptions and pictures of the products you sell. 
These are just as good as I hoped. No self assembly required & very comfortable. Recommended
As a low cost metal detector I give this thing five stars. I bought this Detector several months back and enjoy it's relative ease of use, and it DOES find what you are searching for (coins, rings, earings, necklaces, etc). The other reviews here pretty much wrap it up as a good (affordable!) unit, but I wanted to make a few comments from an amateur's point of view:- This detector has, of course, the discrimination circuitry used to tell the difference between the various metals helping you to avoid digging up junk like soda can pull tabs which are everywhere. It does work pretty good, BUT - I have found that by using the Tracker IV discriminator, you will most likely be missing some good stuff. I have gone back over "Discriminated" areas again in "All Metal" mode and found some nice stuff that Discriminate didn't catch. Granted I am no pro, but the fact is if you want to get every coin, every ring, or every cool item of various metals, you may want to consider just using "All Metal" mode. I almost exclusively use it now and although I sift through some absolute junk. I have found a bunch of coins, necklaces, pendants, etc that I would have otherwise missed. Use the Discriminate mode when looking for that gold wedding ring your wife through at you in the back yard...- Invest in the 4 inch "Gold Nugget Coil" which is far superior at pinpointing metal. The stock coil works fine but is a tad ambiguous as to precisely where your coin, ring, (or pull tab) is. The smaller coil reduces search time and I am glad I have one.- I bought the recommended Bounty Hunter Headphones (to save battery power), but have found them to be a bit more trouble than help. When I detect something I squat or sit down and dig. I set the detector down so the coil is near the dig zone so I can waive clumps of dirt (or sand) in front of the coil as I search. The problem is the headphone's wire tends to be always in the way when I perform this move. I get tired of "untangling" so I don't use them anymore. Maybe I'm just getting old.- The meter is of no value for anyone who can hear the audible report. It has no "range" to judge metals you are passing over. It simply swings hard to the right no matter what from what I can tell. I have tried different modes and different metals to test it, but it seems to merely swing hard to the right as you pass over any type of metal / alloy. I can see how this would still be useful to a deaf person, but it just as easily could have been a bright light bulb instead of a meter. I won't ding this low cost detector for that though because I'd still dig if it was half scale or pegged.- And lastly a warning. If you go into a park, or any area attended by kids, you will be spotted. Within a short amount of time you will be surrounded by kids "helping you" to dig up buried treasure. At that point you have to decide whether to be a meanie and bark at them, or write the rest of the hunt off and let them shred the area every time the detector beeps. I generally tell them how it's been a long day and "see ya" since they will invariably have their hands in there digging away no matter what you say...
The Bounty Hunter is an excellent value for the person who loves to scour about an area that was lush with people ie.(company picnic, family reunion).  The Hunter is easy to use and is lightweight. The instructions are clear and concise in describing the difference between a rusty nail and a piece of jewerly. This is my first Bounty Hunter, and I've already recommended it to my friends
The sensor works very well however, since it is an outdoor sensor, it should be waterproof. It is not. It must be placed where the rain will not fall on it
Bought this as an open box.  What a great detector for the money.  I had it out of the box and up and running in 5 mins.  Very easy setup!!  Took it to the back yard and found 3 pennies in the first 10 mins (one was a wheat penny).  The LCD correctly displayed them as a pennies.  As this was my first time detecting, the unit seems very easy to use.  An excellent choice for those wanting a feature filled detector at a bargin price
This clock is very simple and clean.  I had no problem getting mine to work.  I had to leave it overnight to get the signal and they all set.  One has walls blocking the western direction, and it sometimes loses the signal, so I just leave it out overnight at a better location and put it back.Overall, I really like this clock
Fairly accurate, but not precise.  Also, a replacement unit costs more than a completely new system.  Oregon Scientific has a very strange pricing model
This was the best price on the internet for this item.  It fit perfectly and solved the problem
Extremely pleased!  We received the entire Strathwood Bainbridge Collection within 2 weeks and the packing job alone seems to be worth the cost of the product(s)!!  The patio furniture is both beautiful and solid. Hope it will last for many years.  
Ok, I just got one of these things, and I have to admit that last evening I stood by our seasonal stream watching the mosquitoes laying eggs on the water, and the mosquitoes weren't noticing me a bit.  I do have a big Lentek mosquito trap which has been helping quite a bit with the populations, but really, they should have been driving me nuts.Now, I haven't yet used up a cartridge, so I don't know which one is inaccurate, but the online advertising, copied here and a zillion other places, says each cartridge lasts "at least 120 hours".  However, the product package says they last "up to 12 hours".  Big difference!  I've emailed the company and will be quite interested to learn which is the actual specification
It's a good watch, i'm happy with it, it does the jobThe altimeter is not that accurate but that's the case with almost all the barometric altimeters, if u don't mind putting in the correct altitude once in an wile is OKthe rest is A O K
I am delighted with this product.  It is beautiful and reasonably priced
I have been using Adobe Acrobat for a few years now.  I've used both their Professional and Standard versions.  Now, Adobe has released Acrobat 7.  In this review, I will be discussing primarily the features of the Standard edition.  However, these features are also available in the Professional edition.  Outside of the fact that the Professional version has more workgroup-oriented and enterprise features, these programs are the basically same.  I have noted any features available only in Professional in this review.  First, what is PDF and what can it do for me?Adobe's PDF is now a universal format that allows you to preserve the look and integrity of your original documents - Adobe PDF files look exactly like the original pages and fulfill requirements for electronic filing and document security.Not only that, but you can share the files with anyone, whether on a PC or a Mac.  Each PDF file has the graphics and fonts imbedded into the file.  The user of  the file does not have to have the same font set, nor even purchase Adobe Acrobat, because the Reader version of Acrobat is free!New Features in Acrobat 7*	Turn MS Outlook email into searchable documents.  This is a great feature.  It allows you to effortlessly turn those old emails into the universal PDF format.  Acrobat's searching capabilities make even searching through the longest emails easy and accurate.*	Attaching source files.  Previously, we have been able to create  PDFs from spreadsheet and other formats.  Now, not only can you do that, but this new feature allows you to attach the documents with the PDF!*	Improved Browser.  Acrobat's browser has been improved to make searching for documents easier.  If you are familiar with the Adobe Photoshop browser, you'll like the new upgraded browser in Acrobat 7.*	Searching improved.  The search feature has been improved when you are looking for files.  It is easier to search for files, because now Adobe has made the feature more friendly.  You can search by document and text properties on your local computer or across your companies LAN or WAN networked drives.More About AcrobatAlthough many people are familiar with the Acrobat Reader program, they are not as familiar with Acrobat itself.  I consult will many business persons and they are just astounded at what Acrobat 7 can actually do for their business.  Just the fact that you can collect and assemble output from different types of programs into on universal format floors them every time!  Another great point about assembling the documents in Acrobat is the compression factor.  With Acrobat, users are able to compress the original documents, thus saving space and making it more efficient to transmit the documents via email or internet downloads.This new version can now also create, and save "PDF/A" files for archiving and it allows users to  scan paper documents directly into a searchable PDF file saving space and time.  Many companies around the country are making the jump to the "paperless" environment.  Acrobat 7 can definitely help.In fact, I know of an attorney's office making great use of Acrobat.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.  Even legal documents can be approved, digitally signed and verified in Acrobat.Anyone concerned about the security of their documents has nothing to fear.  Acrobat's security features including the ability to create self-signed digital IDs are terrific; no matter if you have PDF documents loaded on your website for downloading to clients or if you are emailing the files.  For Professional users, Adobe has added a new feature called E-envelopes.  With the new E-Envelopes, user can package their PDF files in an encrypted wrapper and send those files securely via email.  For company networks, Adobe has also added support for your company-wide security policies using a new feature called Lifecycle Policy Service.  The granularity of the security allows the user to pick exactly what they will allow the recipient of the file to do like printing, copying, pasting and so on.  Many people are also surprised that Acrobat isn't just for static documents.  Users can create interactive forms (Professional Only) as well.  In fact, I know a client who is an attorney.  They have almost converted their entire office to a paperless organization by using Acrobat because of its form creation, reviewing, commenting, approval and signature features.  In paper document storage space alone, this office is saving thousands of dollars per year.For CAD and graphics professionals who work with 3D files, Acrobat 7 (Professional Only) can now convert these into PDF format for ease of viewing, whether in electronic or printed format.  This will allow the users to quickly send their clients views of the 3D object in the universal PDF format without the purchase of additional software for the recipient of the file.Another feature is the new licensing capability that Adobe has added to Acrobat 7.  You can install the program and activate it on two separate computers, which is great if you work at home and at the office as well.  Need to install it on a third computer?  Not a problem.  The transfer activation feature allows you to transfer the license to another computer.  To do this, deactivate one copy and transfer the activation via a simple menu command. If your computers have internet access, the change happens right away.  This feature alone may save users money on purchasing multiple copies of the software.SummaryI would highly recommend this product to anyone in business.  The easy of use and versatility of Adobe Acrobat 7 make it an indispensable tool,  whether you are a legal professional, an IT company, accounting firm, healthcare company or anyone else in business.This is one investment where the ROI will definitely outweigh the purchase price of the software within weeks of normal use.  The ability to go paperless and save valuable office space that is now gobbled up by filing cabinets, paper binds and closets alone should make the difference for almost any company.Testing SetupTo conduct tests of the software, the following hardware was used:PC Compatible System (2 GHz Athlon Processor, 512 MB Ram, 30 GB HD)Epson Scanner/Fax/PrinterHP LaserJet 8150DN PrinterFor software tests (conversion to PDF format), the following software was used:MS Office 2003 (Word, Excel, Outlook)Photoshop CSLoren ElksGroup Manager, D-MAG.or
I really enjoy the Nancy Drew games. They can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a Junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done. The check list continues to update as you move through the game. I look forward to each new game as it comes out and can't leave the computer until they are done
The new Adobe Acrobat has a cleaner look and feel, and is more user-friendly.  I especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any Microsoft application, which allow you to create a PDF in one click rather than having to go to File and Print. Some functionality as before, with some new organization and better look/feel
I bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school.  I used it because its what is being used at my office.  I wish they had included Frontpage instead of One Note (which I really haven't been able to find a use for).  Otherwise, it works the same as other MS Office packages I've used in the past
I have been running XP for a few days and so far so good. I was running win98se and decided to upgrade after microsoft announced that they no longer support win98. My software is now obsolete? Yikes! Well, I'm glad I upgraded.Installation went smooth as silk and I have not experienced any problems at all. I had to find a couple of new drivers for hardware but that's been it. And for Home Edition versus Pro, I think I can be quite happy with the Home Edition.I will say that win98se had been a headache for a long time so the stability that I see so far with XP Home is a relief.Good features, good reliability. A very decent upgrade. I recommend it. Four stars
This package is very complete and easy to use.  Took just a few minutes to be drawing house layouts, et.  A lot of the tools are intuitive and simple
I liked everything about this product except it is a little too slow at times. I always shoot with Nikon RAW format. It has hung a couple of times and I had to kill it after waiting for 10-15 minutes.
I'm not a Spider-Man fan.  I love POWERS, THE ULTIMATES, SUPREME POWER, PLANETARY and other stuff by Warren Ellis, Brian Michael Bendis, et.al.  So when I bought this, I wondered if spending a whopping $49 would be worth it.    I wanted to read Straczynski's recent run of Spider-Man, but if I was going to spend about $20 on a graphic novel, why not spend a little more for the whole thing.  And that's just what you get.  In addition to getting Straczynski's 4-year run (which includes Spider-Man's evolution and discovery of his totemic powers), you get everything leading up to JUNE 2006 (which is just like 3 issues ago!).  And all on 1 DVD-ROM.  True, the Cons are that when it comes to Crossovers, you only get the Amazing Spider-Man stories and reading it off your computer isn't as fun as reading the actual comics -- but that doesn't compare to getting the entire run.  It's like complaining about getting a free PS3, XBox360 AND Nintendo Wii, because the box didn't come with it or you're missing one controller.  $50 may seem steep, but if comics cost $3 now, so for the price of like one or two months worth of comics -- or for 2 books, you get everything.  And it's true, you can just print out the pages if you want (so if you want to abuse your office or school's printer, go for it!
I loved the X-Men cartoon in the 90s and Fox, and always liked reading the graphic novels in Barnes and Noble and the like.  However, I just never had the time or money to get into it like I wanted.  This collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years.  Reading the first 60 issues was a trip -- seeing how the characters were developed, both the art and their literary personality.  If you're interested in the X-Men, whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart -- for 40 bucks you can know it all. (almost)
You can read it BEFORE buying the product by looking on the ZA site. I'm going to make this hard and make you google it. I'm not going to criticize anyone except to say IF you have a question or problem, the ZA website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company's products. There are some compatibility probs for example with Yahoo Mail BETA. As soon as Yahoo finalizes it's mail server ZA will be compatible. Simply switch back to yahoo mail (pre beta). There are several other beta products but generally if you're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs. ZA REALLY is better at what it is suppose to do than other products ONCE you have learned how to use it. Kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar. I use the free stuff too, and recommend them for those who are on a budget - students, etc. but the ZA suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who can't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway. I know what you're thinking btw...but ask yourself "Is your private information, time  and computer worth it to you?" If so go with Zone Alarm, learn how to use it and be safer on the net.John Rowin1ea
I discovered this software by accident, while window shopping, and I ended up buying it and taking it home.  I was able to get it up and running pretty quickly, and was creating my own music right out of the box.  Of course it takes some time, but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time.  Add a mic to your computer,and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording/editing studio, make your own music and burn it to CD.  Sounic Foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web, by providing an online community of Acid music-makers who review and comment on one anothers' work.  You can also listen to music published by other users.  Even if you're just a musical legend in your own living room, this makes it easy and fun to become just that.  Sound Forge also sells music loops on CD especially for Acid, but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work.  Sound Forge also provides weekly samples for free on their Acid Planet website
Homesite is widely recognized as "the" premier tool for coding HTML, client side, and server side code by hand. Adding it to your resume won't land you a job, but it will certainly boost your chances of getting an interview because it indicates that you are not a cheap, WYSIWYG junkie.One of the things I like best about Homesite 5 is the adaptability it allows when coding in ASP.NET. I was able to find a plug-in, which when added to Homesite, recognized the .NET tags and colors them accordingly. There are similar plug-ins for just about every language out there.If you are unfamiliar with HomeSite, are considering a purchase, but are not sure it's the right tool for you, here's a very brief description on how it works: This is not a drag-and-drop design tool that created the code for you. It is, in essence, a text editor on steroids. As you code BY HAND it will color the code for you, tell you when you've made errors, offer you a ton of help on knowing what tags mean, has a built in FTP client, helps you organize your work into projects, and a bunch of other functions I've never used.Here's the main thing you need to know: If you're a HomeSite pro, then you are also a REAL developer.To everyone who has whined about lack of support: What do you expect for less then $100? If you purchase a flagship product from Macromedia such as Dreamweaver, Studio MX, or Fireworks, you'll get all the support you'll need.Also, I've been able to find PLENTY of FREE support from news groups and email lists that focus on web development. For every problem or question I've found someone who knows the solution. You can too!!!Just a note: Amazon is behind the times. From the Macromedia website you can now purchase two versions ahead of what Amazon is offering.Well worth the $99.00
I am amazed what this program can do. It is a big difference from PS 5.5. It is a new learning curve but well worth it. What used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes. Amazon had the best price for me from a source I trust ordering from. It is worth it
The software does a lot of great things.  You can start basic and work your way up to the more difficult tasks.  The system does run a bit slow and takes a long time to shut off but other than that, it is great software
Love this product.  I like having these Microsoft programs without paying the price for the full versios
Version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features, like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become. More than anything, version 7 increases one's ability to collaborate securely, providing complete control over your document, who can open, print, or even comment on it. But version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade, as it cures many of the ills of the previous version. Best of all, Adobe has kept the price the same. Very nice
The product is easy to use.  Like how it intergrates with MS Office applications.  It's been a great tool for providing documents to my clients
I bought this CD for my two grandchildren for Christmas. They have all the other Nancy Drew CD's that are out and really enjoy playing them. They are a good interactive game to challenge their minds. I am sure this one will too
I am enjoying this new card shop they have refreshing great cards others do not. My friends and family that I have made cards for think they are the best also. Keep making more and more. Thank
This new version of Illustrator is great, glad I upgraded! The Live Trace feature is cool
Previously I owned ColorVision's Spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it.  It did not include, however, a program for correcting the printer's color rendition. The new Spyder2Pro includes PrintFix Plus.  This along with the monitor correction Spyder2Pro works very effectively.  I am very happy with the program. For the price it is a great addition to Photoshop editing.  The Spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera. I have not found any particular negatives about the program.  In the past I have used their tech service for fine tuning the program.  They were very responsive and helpful.
i have a question about this.  I'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it.  Is that possible on this program?  Cause my friend has Acid Pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it's like $400 and i dont have that kinda money.  Wut i liked about Acid  Pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that, so im wondering if you can do that on this program.  If u have an answer for me, e-mail me at PeepilotT@aol.com .
Good for those looking for a vector collection.  Not so good for those looking for photo clip art, as photos are "high-res" at 200 DPI.  I suppose the photos are useful to an extent, but the usefulness is limited by size.  I was looking for vector art, so I am satisfied
A good choice for newbies that love adventure games.  Nancy Drew's games are perfect, fresh, relaxing, but also give you a lot of thinking some times
For those already familiar, I was excited about this edition when it was advertised that it now works with RAW files.  This one of the advantages that Adobe Photoshop Elements has.  I have a Nikon Digital SLR and I often shoot in RAW and have to convert to .jpg if I want to edit with Microsoft Digital Imaging.  When I went out to buy this "Anniversary" edition, in very small print it reads that it's the same as the previous 2006 edition "except" support for RAW files is no longer included.  Still, it was on sale ($24) and I thought an upgrade would be cool.  When I used it, I saw little or no difference in this than the Microsoft Digital Image 10 I had already been using.  In my opinion, upgrading from 10 isn't worth it. For those new to this product, let me start by saying, I've been a long time user of Microsoft's digital imaging products.  I enjoy the bright, clean look of the interface.  More that that, I love how simple it is to use.  I would recommend Microsoft Digital Image to all skill levels, but especially anyone who's just starting out in Digital Photography and computers.  Hands down, it's the easiest.  It does in one step what would take three Photoshop Elements.  You sacrifice come control, but simplicity is the focus of this program.  Adobe Photoshop Elements is more powerful, but harder to use.  Bottom line is, if you want to concentrate on getting out and taking good pictures instead of spending lots of time editing, get Microsoft Digital Imaging.  For the average shutterbug, It'll edit just as good as Photoshop Elements in less time and for less money.
I've only just begun using this software, but have not found it to be so easy to use for a novice at film editing or to make a slideshow. I would have liked to have seen better and more tutorials. I find the tutorial confusing. So far I have been able find most of the answers to my questions through the Help section, but it just isn't as straight forward as I would have liked. I purchased this b/c it was rated so high by PC Magazine. I'm sure in time I'll learn the software better, but it just seems more challenging and not as easy to learn as most sofware I have taught myself to use.
I installed Norton Antivirus 2007 immediately after installing Windows Vista, Office 2007 and other software on a new computer.  Installation ran smoothly.  LiveUpdate ran automatically and updated the product without a hitch.Norton AntiVirus 2007 not only detects viruses, it detects spyware and rootkits as well.  It has an inbound firewall, and apparently some limited outbound firewall capabilities.  It does not protect against phishing, identity theft, or spam, nor does it contain full outbound firewall protection.When installed on Windows Vista, Norton Antivirus takes over for Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall.  I did not expect the latter; Symantec should have made it more clear that this product includes a software firewall.  Norton AntiVirus integrates well with Windows Security Center.Norton AntiVirus 2007 is noticeably quicker both in normal operation and during full scans than previous versions. Norton AntiVirus has always performed well in industry comparisons against other antivirus products. The only other product that I would use myself is McAfee VirusScan, but I have always felt that Norton AntiVirus does a more aggressive job of protecting my system.For those of you installing Norton AntiVirus 2007 as an upgrade, I would highly recommend that you first remove any existing Norton security products using Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel.  Then, download and run the  Norton Removal Tool from the Symantec site to make sure that it's all gone.To see a comparison chart of the Norton 2007 Windows protection products as of this posting date, browse to Symantec's site, click on "Norton 2007 Products" under Home Products, click on related link "View All Products" and then click "Compare" next to PC Security.
I have got a virus that cause files "comment.htt" appeared in many folders and my previous antivirus can detect them but can not destroy that virus. I tried to use another 2 antiviruses but not effective. So I try KAV and it works! Also KAV does not slow my computer like some big-named antivirus. Autoupdate feature is cool. We do not have to click anything and the prize is reasonable
No brainer.Easy to use.Good value.
This product is great.  It is simple to use and offers everything you need to do cd and dvd recording.  The addition of tivo to go transfers and dvd menus make this product a true winner.  The only problem I have encountered is the length of encoding recordings from tivo to burn them to dvd.  If you need to record audio or video to cd or dvd this is the product you need.  Don't wast time with anything else
OK, it is big (4 CDRs).  And a full install will require over 2.35 GB.  But it loads quickly and offers nice greeting card variety along with pretty sophisticated card customization options on all pages of the card.  As in previous years, it also installs Event Planner. If you don't want to use Event Planner you can stop it from starting with Windows by going to START / ALL PROGRAMS / Startup group and deleting the entry for Event Planner from the STARTUP group but if you don't have a similar program, you might find Event Planner to be useful.I found setting up this program for my auto-duplexing Ricoh color laser printer easy enough to do, so setting it up for other printers will likely be pretty easy also. The quality of the printed cards is really astounding, even my normally "picky" wife thinks they look very nice and acceptable for any use. I suppose your results could depend on your printer but if your printer currently prints nice graphics and pictures, then the cards should turn out very nice. I recommend using heavy card stock for a professional looking final product. Cards that default to printing out in the 1/4 sheet size (four fold) format can easily be printed at 1/2 fold size and the graphics and text remain outstanding. I never experimented with the "partial install" that would require disk swapping but save HD space, so I cannot if that would be a nuisance or not.  Overall, there is nothing I've found about the program that I don't like.    
A good product but like a lot of Microsoft releases, not everyone outside of Microsoft is ready for it.  Check with your web hosting service first to be sure they support sites developed with Expression Web.  That is a problem I have run into.  In fact some hosting services that support Front Page, haven't even come to full support of Front Page 2003 let alone Expression Web. You could end up changing hosting services to take full advantage of this product and its features
I previously had Nero 6 and it had tons of bugs for me. I upgraded to 7 ultra enhanced when I upgraded my computer to Vista premium, and I was pleasantly surprised. Everything I have tried so far has been flawless.It seems that different systems have different results with Nero. For example some people say Nero 6 works best for them, but on my old system it was horrible (running on win2k).It's complicated software though, so people should give Nero a break.Overall they do a great job. Just download the trial first and see how it runs on your system.
If you look at my review history, you may note that I've given very few five-star reviews. I save five stars for outstanding products. I believe Wordperfect X3 is best described as outstanding.A long time ago, I used Word Perfect. However, my earlier jobs required I use MS Word, so I did my best to become a Word guru. I believe I accomplished that short of creating custom macros. As a law clerk, I started a new job where WordPerfect was the standard.So, last year I bought WordPerfect 12. At first it was difficult, but I bought a book that helped me fill in the blanks. With the ability to customize keyboards and the fact that WordPerfect gives the author a great degree of control (especially with show-codes), I was soon able to become a WordPerfect guru. I remembered all the things I used to love about WordPerfect. Like any lover, I also learned to ignore some of the blimishes of WordPerfect. (One of those blemishes is the behavior of pushing a change from that point of the document forward, which, once you get accustomed to it, is really a nice feature.) Wordperfect and PDFs are the two accepted file formats for electronic submission to Federal courts.There were two complaints I found at work among Word devotees: 1) the ability to export to PDF but not import and 2) the inability to cut from a Word document into a WordPerfect document without creating all the formatting litter Word likes to use.1. We occasionally receive PDFs that we would have to retype to be able to make edits. With the ability to import PDFs (that is, those that were authored and exported into PDF, not documents scanned into PDF), we were now able to edit those PDFs. This was a real time saver. Since PDF is the de facto universal standard amongst all platforms (Windows, Mac, Unix), this was a great improvement.2. Formatting litter is a real pain to deal with. I never could get a MS Word document to just import into WordPerfect without headaches in trying to fix the formatting. My solution was to copy the portion out of MS Word, paste into a text file, copy again and then paste into WordPerfect. My complaint was I could not just straight paste into WordPerfect. Well, Corel heard my cry and provided the ability to copy just the text. The lone MS Word holdout in my office capitulated with that. He has no more to complain about.Another great thing about WordPerfect is the fact that the file format for its documents has not changed in years (I heard a WP rep say no change since 1995). Why should it? Everything you could want to do in a document (perhaps barring professional typesetting) can be done in WordPerfect. There's no need to create a new format when the one you have just works.This product does exactly what those who have come to love WP expect it to do. I think Corel has done a good job of resolving my own personal quibbles with WP.So, if you're looking for a solid performer that seeks to beat competition by improving itself, WPX3 is representative of what you're looking for
QuickBooks is an incredible product. If you have never used it before try having someone walk you through it
Like many other long term hobby digital photo fans I have used Paint Shop Pro for more than 10 years from version 4. It has always been a frustration that the programme was written for creating paint type graphics and photos were almost an add on. As Digital photography became more and more a real option the earlier versions of Paint Shop Pro became more of a frustration and I tried everything else. At last Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo feels like it was written for photo editing. It is easy to use with all the assistance a beginner could want, but dig deeper and it will go wherever you want to go, and more. I'm sad to see Paint Shop Album almost redundant, but it is great to have the organiser on tap. It runs on a less than optimal computer system unlike others that are too large and slow for many of us to consider.
I purchased the mangadebut because i wanted to dabble in tones and inking (which I usually never do, usually I just scan in the sketch and then darken it with a photo editing.) I came to find out that using lines and erasing the sketch makes for a much more clean finished product. Of course, you could acomplish this with MS Paint if you really wanted to. One of the main (and only, in my opinion) advantages to this program is the amazingly vast variations of tones available to make your art more interesting. that alone makes it worth the 50 dollars you put into it.One downside is that this program, because of it's many tones, uses and requires quite a bit of space. When I uploaded it on my laptop,it slowed down significantly. So much so that now I load it when I want to finish a nice drawing and the delete it from the computer again! XDoverall it deserves about 3-4 stars. ^.^
I'm an old school comic book collectors and I bought this in order to see what the technology has done with the print page.  This is more about collecting the stories than it is about collecting the art--and I still find there's no substitute for the feel of those magical pages
This software is focused on learning the rules of the game.  Movement of different pieces and pawns is demonstrated through an assortment of arcade-type games.  There are some decent books for learning chess for beginners, but learning through a computer game program makes it much easier and more fun.The program doesn't contain any instructions,so some people may find it frustrating figuring out what to do in the beginning. However, there is a symbol in the top right corner, clicking on which brings down the menu at which point navigating becomes a piece of cake.Just knowing the rules of the game enables one to play chess, but not exactly to win, so the second CD in this series (Learn to Play Chess 2) continues where the first one left off and goes into different tactics and strategies.  The software is recommended for 8 year-old children and older - kids at heart may have fun learning chess with this program also
This Bible is wonderful! It's written in language that is easy to understand. Many people give up on trying to study the Bible because the language is so different from the way we speak now. You won't have that problem with the New Living Translation, and the notes are so helpful. Whenever I'm unclear about a verse or the context, I check the notes, and usually they help me to understand the meaning. They also help me to understand traditions of the time and meanings that were implied to the readers of the time. Whether you've been a Christian for 50 years, or you're only thinking of trying to read the Bible for the first time, or you're anywhere in between, this Bible is a great choice
I've been using Streets & Trips for years. I'm a real estate broker and use it every day. great product. Not as up-to-date as yahoo maps but easier and faster to use, particularly the route planner, gps, live local links, etc
Great improvement in Photoshop technology.  I've greatly improved my ability to process astrophotography.  It's now much easier to make the same changes to multiple images of the same celestial object.  Greatly reducing the time required to process multiple images for stacking, aligning and combining.
I currently have version 1.0 on my pc. It does everything it claims to and does it flawlessly. It cleans internet cache, history, cookies and more! I've tried another internet privacy program, but it failed to clean up the tracks that this program successfully cleaned. I especially like the fact that it cleans the autocomplete entries in my internet search and internet browser. Others can use my pc, and won't be able to see what documents I've recently opened, which programs I've recently run, or what I've searched for and what sites I've visited online. And that's the way it should be! This program can be set to clean up this information securely (can be set to wipe not just delete the info). Another plus, it can clean usage tracks for all users on a pc. The program I tried on my other pc only worked with administrator accounts (and not very well may I ad)
TaxCut has been very reliable information and easy to use when preparing your taxes.  I have used it over the past several years.  Updates are easy to download and the software is great.  This year the software arrived on a USB key.  This is the easiest and best way to obtain the software.  Small, easy to store and is reusable.  I will continue to use TaxCut in the future
I was bought for my 13month daughtor.This is her favorite litte touch book because lulu is very friendly friend.This is worthy of money. We love it
I am a computer repair tech and I can bet 90% of the problems reported in these reviews for this product is because people double install security programs. You should never install more than 1 antivirus program into your OS. Most of the decriptions of problems are from doing just that, double installs. PLEASE PLEASE ..remove/uninstall any previous antivirus programs and 3rd party firewalls. then reboot..use a good registry cleaner-freeware program like CCleaner to remove leftover registry keys, then reboot again and then and only then install your new Antivirus/Security program. I have this program and when installed properly on a cleaned system, it works great. A very good product at a very good price. I can't comment on it's tech support, I have never used it
I travel quite a bit and am able to use the digital recorder to take notes while driving.  It has saved me a lot of time and works well
I made the mistake of ordering this product and Microsoft Office 2007 which I didn't realize that it was also offered in Office 2007 which I didn't need 2 of them so I gave the other one to my sister who just loves to keep all her records in the
I purchased Panda Internet Security 2007 for two reasons: The price after rebates (Free) and the fact that it is a 3-user license.  After switching from McAfee to Norton (and a subsequent 1-year renewal) I decided to either buy PC-Cillin 2007 or try Panda. (39.99 or Free...hmm...)  I installed Panda on my laptop first (after uninstalling Norton Internet Security 2005).  No problem what-so-ever.  In the initial HDD scan, Panda found and cleaned 5 files that were found in my email inbox identified as a worm.  I then installed Panda on 2 desktop machines with no problems there either.  Panda found 3 traces of spyware on one machine and nothing on the second.  Panda boots up with Windows XP quickly.  It has only given me a couple of pop-up messages (one for a WiFi intrusion, which was another computer on my network...I accepted it and it never came back.  The other pop-up was to start on-line customer service or something like that...I declined it and it has yet to come back.)My laptop is a P4 1.8GHz, 1GB ram, 32MB ATI video, 40GB HDD.  The initial virus scan took less than 20 minutes, scanning over 250,000 files.  Not bad!  Desktop 1's first scan (P4 2.4GHz, 512MB, 128MB video, 120GB HDD) scanned nearly 300,000 files also under 20 minutes.  Desktop 2 was the quickest (P4 3.4GHz, 1GB, 128MB video, 80GB HDD) scanning over 330,000 files in about 15 minutes.I am extremely impressed with Panda Internet Security 2007.  It's everything I hoped it would be.  I would definitely recommend this product to others
I have Windows XP which came with McAfee. I used both Norton and McAfee but lately McAfee's updates seem to have giving other users a lot of trouble.  Rather than updating the anti-virus definitions, etc., I decided to try Zone Alarm where many users seem to like it.  I must say that from the moment I installed it the only problem I ran was that you have to completely unistall your current antivirus, firewall, etc. if ZoneAlarm is  to work.  To date the software has worked beautifully.   Actually, I believe that my computer runs smoother and slightly faster.  I definately would upgrade or buy this product again.  Check some of the sellers for the bargain prices.  I bought mine for 19.99, which is a big savings from the ZoneAlarm website.  It is worth every penny
Before buying QuickBooks you should Google: QuickBooks 2007 Simple Start Free Starter Edition. This free version never times out. You can immediately download 400m or get the CD with no shipping charge. The big limit in the free upgradeable version is you only get 20 total customers and vendors, so it is ideal for students and those with limited needs
July 27, 2005Why haven't I heard about the Mia characters before? I bought this for my god daughters 6th birthday without knowing anything about the game. We opened it together and I was BLOWN AWAY with the 3D animation-the same quality as Pixar. Everyone at the party was glued to the computer screen in this adventure land game. Best of all, its educational but because it was so entertaininng, my god-daughter has not stopped playing it. Well worth your money! I'm going to buy the rest of the Mia series
Don't think about video capture cards, going into the operating system, or even opening the computer case - just turn on the power, plug Dazzle's USB plug into your usb port, and connect the colored cords on your vcr with the same colored plugs on Dazzle, install the software, and let this wonderful tool do all of the heavy lifting.EXCELLENT quality, and they will lower the quality if you want a smaller file - like, say, if you want to back-up your vcr to a cd-r. The test for quality is time - tell it to record to 70 minutes, and your work is DONE.I REALLY like the fact that the software is so stable, I recorded a SIX HOUR VCR tape using a 512 meg XP machine - not a moment's problem.They also included software that makes editing these video files real easy, if you want. That is just icing on the cake.Strong, solid, silent - the John Wayne of VCR to computer file translator tools.As an aside, I have held onto some VCR tapes for years, one for more than a decade, hoping something like Dazzle would come along.Prayers answered.Just shut up and BUY it
I think some of the reviewers here did not use the program more enough, am using it since version 2 till now as an illustrator this program can't be beated... gradient fill was so stupid to create in earlier versions of adobe illustrator u must create two objects then blend them together to form a gradient fill then you have to mask it within a path or the shape you are filling, one more thing the mask in corel "container" is a wonderful tool to have much better than the mask used in illustrator that sucks (u have to see me pulling out my hear if i made i mistake using it) do you want more i have a lot to mention.Am using both program everyday know them very well and to be honest i do all the artwork in coreldraw then i export to illustrator for color separation and printing and that becuase the printers agancies in my country don't know how to use corel so i have to ride the wave and finalize thing in illustrator.I do all detailed drawings precisely using the guidelines and grid (first in available in corel) creating layouts, realistic objects or models with shadings and shadowing as well with ease this software is so powerfull if you are a real artist you must get i
This is a great software for Photographers looking for a faster way to manager and edit images. I gave it a four because I would hope that ADOBE would still find ways to improve this product. The functionality is superb, and for such a great program, it doesn't eat too much memory on your computer (I have a 4 year old PC with 768 MB of RAM). And because of this I'm shooting more pictures in RAW format and not worry about the time I spend in front of the computer.I'll definitely be buying the next upgrade
yeah its great. get rid of ur piece of DOO-DOO windows operating system and pick yo self up dis! aight piece yallz. and remember once yo go mac ya neva go back
Excellent product works as advertised and so simple to use. Product well packaged, arrived earlier than expected and in mint condition. ScanSoft responded with an eMail in a timely fashion acknowledging receipt of my Rebate paperwork and provided a pin number for me to access their site to check on it's progress. But you know Rebates....they take forever!PDF Converter 4 is not my only ScanSoft Product. I also use Paperport 10 and am extremely satisfied with that.My buying experience has always been positive with Amazon.com vendors, never a problem.John Mc LaughlinDaytona Beach, Florid
I love this product. I had so many pictures that need to be in a scrapbook. This was so fast and easy, also it only took a couple of weeks to complete. I didn't over spend on paper,tape,glue, and etc. With three kids I don't have the time to sit down and cut, measure and more. with all my pages completed. I added a FEW things to go along with the theme of my page. I even used left over Christmas wrap to fill the 12X12 for Christmas pictures/theme
First of all, I want to make the point that this is a strategy based tycoon game and a sim game.  It is really well done using superb graphics and animations.  You get to apply new discoveries in your factories so you can make a better product and out sell them to your competitors.  It all seems to be based on real history so you get information from real sources like the Wright brothers, Edison and even Einstein. And you also have to worry about the people that work in your factories, your scientists, and accountants and even worry about industrial espionage. If you like business, engines, buildings, science and physics, you'll be getting hours and hours of play out of this game.  You also get to play in a bunch of different cities in the world.  Each one has different challenges. It's fresh every time you play since you can do things differently and see how the results vary
Xitel INport Deluxe does what it says it does.  You can plug in any RCA AUX connector into the unit and with the software provided you can record it in stereo to your computer.It's a good solid product that does what it says it does but instead of focusing on the features like other reviewers I will point out its minor drawbacks. First, audacity, the a free software that is mentioned in the manual has a tendency to freeze up while recording with the unit.  However, I don't know if it will freeze up on your computer.  Second, if you are thinking about buying this product to turn LPs to CDs, into most LP players don't have RCA AUX plugs and you'll need to buy an addapter.  (What they don't tell you in the manual is that if you do this you first need to adjust the volume on the stereo and recorder volume in parallel which is kinda tricky.) Finally, the manual could use more detail because some of the important features weren't mentioned.   If you don't mind these drawbacks, you will be able to have many years of recording pleasure if you buy this product
Streets and Trips has been a significant help in making our travel plans. We use it in conjunction with our Garmin 2720 GPS system and they are very complementary. The Garmin system doesn't use downloads from the laptop and Streets and Trips therefore allows us to do trip planning on a braosder scale at home. This is a very good program for trip planning
This is the best version of Office yet. The differences are numerous and very significant, it is well worth the investment!
Love the program.... Hate the company!I've been using QuickBooks for more than 10 years.  I started with the basic edition since I am a very small business and use only a portion of the program, specifically Customer and Vendor Lists, Invoicing, A/R and Purchase Orders.OVERKILL is an understatement... QuickBooks Pro is much more powerful than I need.  I don't use Payroll, Check Printing, Year End Accounting and many of its other functions.  SO WHY DID I PURCHASE SUCH A POWERFUL PROGRAM?That's the "rub".  Intuit is not satisfied with its QuickBooks users being content with the edition that they are using; Intuit sales people call all too frequently trying to get you to upgrade to the next higher version (edition) of their program.  They hounded me for years to upgrade from the early basic edition to the then current basic edition; finally, they dropped support of the product and I had no choice.  I purchased QuickBooks 2005 Basic Edition in 2005.  Shortly after purchasing it, they informed me that they were no longer going to support the 2005 Basic Edition and if I wanted continued support I would have to upgrade again, this time to the Pro Edition.  This January (2007) I received an email from Intuit informing me that my 2005 Basic Edition wouldn't run on the new Windows XP Vista platform and if I switched to Vista I would need to upgrade to QuickBooks Pro.  I upgraded to a new PC in February as the result of a major crash on my former system and opted to go with Vista, thinking that I could install Windows 98 as a second operating system to run QuickBooks 2005 Basic.  The second operating system didn't work out and, after seriously considering switching to Microsoft Accounting 2007, I purchased QuickBooks Pro.I was very disappointed that Intuit didn't offer a significant purchase incentive to existing users; but they never have in all the years that I've been using their product.  Even Microsoft, the shark of sharks, offers incentives.  DON'T BE MISHEARTENED.I purchased the program from Amazon and, with rebates and other purchase incentives, saved $60 over Intuit's price; I could have saved an additional $25 if I had bought on eBay (had I known it at the time). 
Simple and easiest to use of T Shirt programs.  Don't be put off by the low prices.  Simply Magazine, with their Simply Media brands, have lots of craft products like this, with all of them on Amazon I think.Mar
I bought ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite for the included ZoneAlarm Pro firewall (it cost much less that way).  If I didn't already have Norton Antivirus, I'd use the antivirus, too
I am an adult trying to learn Piano.  This program is great for learning simple songs and does have a very good feedback system.The lessons are taught with plenty of simple songs which you can play and the feedback system will track how well you play.  The feedback system tracks your key presses, rythem, and note length.  However, it does not track the strength of your key press.I would like to see more exercises to develop better basic skills, instead of just playing simple songs.  Also, the feedback program can be very discouraging for children as it is very sensitive and report very minor error.Overall, this is still a great program to have for self learner, but in no way will it beat a real piano teacher
QuickBooks lives up to it's reputation of being the one-size-fits-all small business book keeping software.  It does what you want it to do.  I like the feature of being able to easily sent e-mail invoices.  If you need the software right away it is just as cheap at the office supply stores
I have been using Printmaster Platinun for several years and love it. I scrapbook constantly using all of the features. I have printed thousands of items with this program. If  people have problems with the program it is because it uses alot of memory and the problem is their computer.  I have gotten rid of 10 scrapbook, photo programs and only use Printmaster. There is no better program.  Ann
Don't get confused by the licensing mumbo jumbo that comes on the package. It is the full version ready to be installed. Don't forget to plan out your disk partitioning strategy before you start. So far, I have not noticed a dime's worth of difference from the Pro version. It is working great.However, the Vista coupon shipped with my package expired on March 15, 2007. Additionally, the coupon only applied to new systems purchased between October 26, 2006 and March 15, 2007, so don't let the Vista thing induce you
The lawsuit mentioned in Mr John Matlock "Gunny" review has nothing to do with the quality or legality of documents created using Quicken WillMaker Plus software. Instead, it concerns the actions of an insurance agent who was found to have practiced law without a license. He used will-making software (not Quicken WillMaker Plus) to write a willfor an elderly client. The trouble arose because he created the will outside of her presence and arranged for her to sign it while she was hospitalized. Apparently she never reviewed the will. In other words, he acted too much like a lawyer. While the "unauthorized practice of law" is a vague concept, had the insurance agent merely recorded the woman's wishes and entered them verbatim into the software, there would almost certainly have been no problem.There is no problem with using software to prepare a will for your self. Nor is there a problem with using it to create a will for someone else if you merely type in that person's answers at their direction. The main way to run afoul of unauthorized-practice-of-law rules is to give legal advice to or prepare documents for others without their express, detailed instructions.
I am very pleased with the product - I had trouble with my system and Microsoft tech support was outstanding on helping me solve the issues
When my last computer got zapped by lightning the one thing I missed the most was being able to balance my check book. Glad to be back on track. I like the new look
This was the only place I could find Turbo Tax where I did not have to pay extra for state tax.  I live in Washington and we do not have state income tax.  I even asked Intuit how to get a version without the state tax, they said that was not possible.  I have used Turbo Tax for many years and I will buy from Amazon again next year.Too bad some people can not read and then blame someone else for problems they caused.  Sound like a couple of 5 year olds.The only down side for me I received an email from amazon saying shipment would be delayed 15 days.  2 days later the software arrivied, right on the day amazon originally said it should.  Don't know why they sent the 15 day delay email
I am fluent in Spanish. So, the Rosetta Stone Italian language software, was perfect for me. It is very easy to understand, to follow and to learn. If you study one hour per day, in one week you are going to remember several words and phrases. I don't have any regret at all, I think my investment was worthwhile.
This software is wonderful! I have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook digitally for many years. I've tried Broderbund (sp?) whose interface was too clumsy, Nova which was rather difficult at times (many things you can't do) and now this. When I first took this out of the package and installed it I thought I had made the wrong decision with this software since there were very, very few backgrounds, templates or embellishements even when I opened the Xtras CDs that came with this. I truly did not feel the Xtras CDs were worth purchasing since there are very few things on them. But then I found the tutorials that are included on the CD and watched the one about making collages. I didn't get halfway through the video - I had figured out how to do it. I have now created some of the best scrapbook pages I've ever made. Within hours I had a beautiful collage/letter to send with my holiday cards. My husband's first impression was a heartfelt "It's lovely". What has so throughly convinced me of the abilities of this software is that I can take ANY image and make it a background, I can create and manipulate text almost any way I want, I've been able to create my own embellishments as well as using downloaded embellishments from websites that sell it (.png format). I feel like I have no limitations on what I can do now. I imagine this software is not as sophistacated as Adobe Illustrator, but then it probably isn't as complicated to use (from what I remember that program has a rather steep learning curve).You can also use the eyedropper tool to "pick up" any color from any picture, background, or element (read "anything") in the program. I was able to take the background colors and make embellishments that matched! I can take a color from one of my pictues and make a background that matches. You can also remove backgrounds from photos - it takes a bit of time to do, but the area around the image will be transparent - this functionality has many uses.  You can also save your files in many different formats including .jpg for file sharing, etc. There are so many more features I couldn't possibly list them here, nor would you want me too (too much time). If you only use premade templates and don't feel ready to venture out on your own yet this software may not be for you unless you find a website that sells templates for this software. You could start with something like Nova Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 3.0, which I liked, and when you start becoming really frustrated by its limiations it may be time to move up to this program. You may also want to read a book about digital scrapbooking to give you ideas and alert you to possibilities. The great thing about this program is that it isn't just for scrapbooking. You can do all your photo manipulation in it . I have always liked Paint Shop Pro so much that I haven't been able to afford to upgrade my copy since version 6, but I kept using that version. I'm so glad I got version 10 as it is very user friendly too. But please know that version 10 (which comes with this package) is not the most recent version. Version 11 is out now. If you don't want/need the Xtras CDs that come with this package you may want to just buy the most recent version and buy some embellishements from a website that makes .png files (portable network graphics format) or make your own. I hope you have as much fun with this software as I am having. I highly recommend the training videos on the CD - they really help
The engine behind this program is from Chief Architect, who, from what I understand, are developers of professional CAD software. It shows in this program. While this program has one of the best 3D walk around and capabilities, I tend to judge this and others by the drawing tools that it possesses. And this one has some good usable tools. Like most consumer level landscaping programs, this one has photo import so you can design around an actual photo of your home. Unlike other programs, the BHG software allows you to import and mask your own plant images. This is a great feature that my own program has which gives much better visualization with plants you might actually use. All the important stuff that we need to create a sellable visual landscape is there. For now, and with the choices I know of that are available to you, I find this to be the best consumer level landscape and garden program out there. This design software comes with an easy to understand tutorial CD. It was easy to install and start using right away. I think most folks would do quite well with this one. 
I bought this to use with family photos and threw together my first 5 page comic last night.  It was fairly easy to use, but not perfect.  Instructions are thin (read 'mostly nonexistant'); so it is best that you either have time on your hand OR a lot of experience using complex photo software.GOOD:  Simple once you get the hang of it.  Plenty of fixed comic book panel formats to chose from and the drag-and-drop photo application makes life very easy.  As long as you are OK with the formats provided, then putting family photos into a fun comic book format is incredibly easy.  I received rave reviews from my first 'comic' and the finished product was of exceptional quality.  The sofware has a nice assortment of boxes, call-outs and even some fun clip art.  This was a great buy for the price.NOT AS GOOD: The learning curve can be steep due to the quirky layout of controls.  I guess this is not too bad of an issue since there are few controls provided with the software.  The "dude" who wrote instructions was flippant at best (really annoying if you want to find a basic answer) and definitely not paid to produce a quality product.  Downloading photos was tough until I found out the trick - after that, it is quite easy.  BAD: No photo editing software included.  Simple things like rotating photos 90 degrees had to be done prior to loading into Comic Book Creator.  The instructions and "Comic Book Wizard" are close to useless.  Did I mention the controls?  They are basic (good and bad) and poorly laid out (bad).  There is no ability to truly customize panel layouts; so this software will not help out if you want something really creative.  (Diagonals, overlays and more.)All-in-all, this was an excellent buy for a software package under $20.  I created a great storyboard format of some fun memories - bringing a great laugh (and a few "wows") to my family, grandparents and friends.  Just be aware that there is a learning curve to get over before you hit the fun stuff.  If the software was more expensive, then I would have given it 3 stars
One of the best programs that I have to work with CD & DVD
This was my second purchase of a product like this and I loved it. The first one I tried was difficult to use. It was so easy to use. My husband and I were unsure of our remodeling plans and with this we were able to get a vision together of how our home would look once completed. It helped us pick everything from furniture location to color of carpet and flooring. My favorite feature was the Home Estimator feature that tracked our materials useage
I have been supporting QuickBooks as a financial and technical consultant for small businesses for over a dozen years.  This year's version added a neat feature that allows you to see all of your customer's invoices, payments, estimates, - all in the same window - just by clicking on a customer in the list.  No more multiple clicks to create customer reports.  It is just plain easy, and the information pops up on your screen immediately. Congratulations to Intuit on a job well done
I picked this up for my twelve year old son.  He is a beginner and has been glued to his electric guitar and eMedia Rock Guitar Method for the last two weeks.  The program is a great starter, just in case the kids don't stick with it.   It's better than $45 bucks an hour once a week, for now, at least.    Great Product!  I reccomend it
Photoshop CS 2 is in a league of it's own. It can be used to do professional photo retouching and correcting but it is also probably the best painting package out there. It's not perfect however. There are some features that high end compositing and color grading programs like Inferno and DaVinci have that Photoshop could use, and the warper is just bare bones but then we're talking big bucks and no doubt Photoshop will eventually have something like them. Except for a few filters, it can function in 16 bits per channel which was a long time coming but now it's here, making it a professional product. Still, as far as I'm concerned, the ultimate paint program has yet to be written
I've been working with Punch AS/4000 since v10.0 was released (about 12 months ago). Although I agree in many respects with the positive reviews. For example, there are is a large feature list. However, there are issues with the software. For example: - Hard coded limitations in the software design (e.g. four possible scale options for printing, does not support Grid Snap smaller than 3/8" or 10mm - which seriously complicates moving things around on a drawing with any degree of precision, very tiny dimension text on Windows, etc.)- Inaccuracies: I printed a 1:100 scale drawing that came out at 1:94 approximately;- I couldn't fit a scale house drawing on 8.5 X 11 paper, no print preview;- There are limitations and inconsistencies with dimensions (i.e. placement, snap to geometry, etc.)- The PowerTools seem to be a series of independently developed add on modules that don't necessarily conform with the application interface (e.g. precision, look and feel, functionality)- The elevation editor is very limited. It basically provides a visual representation of the drawing with some editing and texture applications- Can't differentiate exterior wall treatments independently from the wall surface (e.g. brick and siding on the same floor).- Object library is very limited for plumbing fixtures, furniture, windows, etc. Common items aren't in the library nor are they easy to find. (You can create them yourself though).- The 3D object editor is ok but not terribly intuitive.- Multi-floor buildings get complicated to work with once you add floors or ceilings.- Once you add objects, drawings get big and slow very quickly.- Import/Export is limitedIn short AS/4000 could use an overhaul, an updated object library, a major upgrade to scale and printing and an overall clean-up to create a more integrated and functional product. Also, incorporate user feedback into future releases
At first I didnt like this game because of the graphics but once I learned how to play I really thought it was fun one time I was so interested that I woke up at 8:00am and played the whole game to 11:00pmIf you are a horse lover and know some amount about horses you will love this game if you do NOT like horses you might still like it but I dont know because I am a major horse lover so here are some things in the game--feed and groom your horse every day.-keep practicing your riding skills you could make it to the championships-they will giveyou tasks to do for instance "breed a horse".- you can go to the breeders office to breed a horse or you can own a stallion and a mare and buy the breeding pasture and breed them yourselves          If you buy this item I hope you have fun with it and hope my review was helpful to you.                    -Libb
This is a major upgrade from previous versions . . . much easier to use and a much cleaner format
After many years of the same look and marginal upgrades, Family Tree Maker finally made a serious change to the look and feel of the product. There are still some awkward navigation issues, but overall, I think this is worth a look if you are a long term user and haven't upgraded in a while or are just starting out. Having used the available online services that this company offers, I was pleased to find a new feature that integrates some of the online search functionality. Although the integration is a bit superficial, it is useful and made some of my online searches of their databases more productive. I think this is a big step in the right direction and hope they continue to add to the power of this feature as it makes the treasure trove of data they have more accessible.Too bad they do not make a Mac version, as I prefer this to the Mac products available and so I have to use it with Parallels, which is not so convenient
I really like OmniForm 5.  Actually I'm using version 5.1 and I'm very satisfied with it.I was using another forms program I had purchased that was adequate but not nearly as good.  After using FormTool I have a much greater appreciation of OmniForm.ScanSoft has been on my list of not to buy software recently  because of some of the poor performance of some of their other programs, tech support is expensive from ScanSoft and none of their software that I have used have been easy to learn using the manuals or help files.  In contrast OmniForm was well worth the money.OmniForm 5 does a great job of either creating forms from scratch, scanning or converting from PDF.  It's the only forms program I have tried so far that actually does a great job of importing a form from a PDF file.Its has all the tools you need to create a form starting with a blank page.  You can define any field with a variety of formats. Example you can create a date field with a specific format then no matter how the data is input the program will automatically reformat the data the way you specified.  You can create just about any field simply by dragging a symbol from a menu onto the page. In the case of inserting a graphic you can choose to have the graphic saved with the form or not saving with the form itself to conserve file size. You can have the graphic resized by the program with little loss of quality.  Features such as these might be available in other programs of this type but I found OmniForm to do the best job with creating a form field by field with the least effort.Scanning in of a form is almost flawless.  It even recognized fields on the paper form that were meant to be circled and created the field for them.  Other programs I have used could not do this well if at all.  The only adjustments I had to make on scanned forms were sometimes OmniForm recognized text as bold when it wasn't and occasionally it would change the font. For example it would change Arial to Times New Roman on some spots of the form. Strange quirk.To get a form imported from a PDF file you have to open the PDF file and print to OmniForm.  This is very accurate with little adjustment necessary after import. OmniForm really shines in this area.  But I did notice if the form your importing from PDF has multiple pages OmniForm will give you an out of memory error when you try to save.  To overcome this flaw you have to import one page at a time, creating a new page each time in OmniForm to make a multi page form from PDF. A little time consuming when you have a 9 page form. It will create a self running .exe form you can e-mail and the person on the other end can fill out the form and send it back. This works even the other person does not have OmniForm on their machine.  Because some people filter out .exe file attachments the program also creates a .html version of the form.  This is a very handy feature.The help file is not of much use. The paper manual is better but still lacking. If you have problems tech support from ScanSoft is expensive.  But there is a user support forum you can get to through the support page on the ScanSoft web site. I have used the forum with great success.Overall this program is a little difficult to use with some quirks and needed features like being able to import and save a multiple page form from PDF.  But well worth the effort to use as it is the most accurate forms program I have used.I do recommend this program.  If the flaws I mentioned were corrected I would give this program 5 stars
The product of Windows XP- Professional is just what I was looking for with many updated features and I am looking forward in using it daily.  It was shipped exacting when they had told me to expect it.  But most of all, Service was "top knotch".  I could not have asked to better service on any questions or problems I may have had. Customer service is a plus. I would not hesitate to purchase another product from this seller
I have been a user since version 4. Version 4 was bad, 5 was good, 6 was terrible, 7 was great, tried 8 & didn't see the point, 9 was stable and very good. I avoided 10. 11 is very good. In Version 12 Corel had added features that made me want to go back to 11. So now here we are on X3.  Let me tell you, It has been 5 years since could say I love this program! It loads faster than 11 or 12 (and about a bizillion times faster than Adobe's Illustrator). It seems in this version, Corel has really given it's users a good listen because the additions to this program bring draw up to a new level of "I can harldy wait to work on a new project". Many of the improvments are simply little things in the way of navigation and shortcuts. Some, like the improved trace work wonderfully and seamlessly. You can go to corel's website to learn of the other improvments. I think you'll be pleased.  This is a designer's tool that you can purchase and use with confidence.
I think this is the best version to come out yet. I would have a high end pc if I was to upgrade only software. I would just wait and buy a new pc. Its alot easyer then learning a new operating system and if you enable the adminstrator account and only use your standard accounts to surf the web then it give you some security. The firewall is good in the business versions and there is some good virus software out there. Its got alot more features and run's good's. Device drivers are easyier to load -scott 
My kids (6 and 8) are learning so much from Fritz and Chesster 2!!  In fact, my 6 year old daughter started winning a few games at their local chess club after graduating to this game (from Fritz and Chesster 1).  Today I decided to play with them (since they don't like to play against each other - they're still working on that "good sportsmanship" thing), and I let them team up against me.  I was viewing this as an opportunity to help them think ahead, predict moves, and protect their pieces.  However, I was the one who learned!!  They surprised me again and again by reciting strategies (move your bishops and knights out, save your Queen for the real battle, don't move your pawns willy nilly, break your oponnent's wall, etc...) they had learned from this game.They also knew the relative value of the pieces, but could see advantages to making uneven swaps sometimes.  For example, they shocked me by sacrificing a bishop for a pawn in order to open a hole in my wall, which they later exploited to checkmate my  king.  This was a strategy that even 1 month ago would have been unthinkable to them.Anyway, I defer to other more experienced chess players and computer users who have made specific comments about graphics, dialogue, and strategies.  I am sure that at some point, my kids will move beyond this game and what it has to offer.  But for now I couldn't be happier with the Chesster and Fritz games!  My kids absolutely love playing the computer games and are really learning to play chess - and not just "computer chess", but chess that lets them beat other kids at chess club - not to mention me.  I think I'm going to go demand a rematch :)
This item was delivered in a timely manner and my son really enjoyed it. Thanks
I was pleaed at how quickly I began to pick up on the language.  I plan to purchase other Rosetta Stone Products in the futur
I came across Magix Audio Cleaning Lab about 4 years ago.  Once I got the hang of it, I really liked it.  However, I kept wondering if there were better programs out there.  I mean, really, how good can it be for $39, right?  I recently paid $75 for Sony's famed Sound Forge Studio (which is the Sound Forge program minus various some features).  I spent a lot of time with Sound Forge Studio, working to perfect my transfer of some private music recordings from cassette to CD.  I was happy with what I was able to accomplish with Sound Forge.  At least I thought I was happy.  I compared my work in Sound Forge Studio to the same cassette transfer I did with Magix Audio Cleaning Lab 10 (the previous iteration of this software).  Guess what?  I liked the Magix work much better.  So, I immediately purchased Audio Cleaning Lab 11 and unintalled Sony's Sound Forge Studeio from my computer.  Magix could charge $150 for this software and I would buy it in a second.  Your going to have to take the time to carefully read through the full manual to get the most out of this software - but it is worth the effort.  This program does the work of software costing 3 times as much. 
Voice recognition software continues to improve.  I've been using versions of this software since 1998 and can see significant improvements in the voice recognition technology over that period.Before investing in this software, though, check carefully the specifications of your PC.  The faster the processor and the more RAM you have, the better the results.  The software will run on the minimum specification identified, but it may not run fast enough to satisfy the needs of some us.This software is useful in many circumstances.  Many of us can speak faster than we can type and many of us compose as we type.  The software can be used with a range of eMail clients as well as in word processing and other software.  You can, as it claims, obtain reasonable voice recognition results with a few minutes of set up and training.  But for optimal use, and the best return on investment, consider using the voice command capabilities to drive other software.  This takes more effort initially but can deliver significant benefits.I'll be buying a new PC before I look at upgrading this software.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smit
I don't understand why testing for each language exercise is not the default selection instead of having to select it.  It is frustrating to go through an entire exercise hoping to see how well you did....and realize that you forgot to select "test" at the beginning.  Also, it seems that testing should be available for the 'guided exercise' also ...... not just the regular exercises.  Other than these two things, the program is very good
We have used ScanSoft/Nuance products for over five years - As a matter of fact I am writing this review using Dragon 8. OmniPage Pro 15 along with the PDF converter is by far the best on the market. The technical support has been fantastic throughout the years and the engineers always had open ears for recommended changes. OmniPage Pro 15 has saved me thousands of dollars because of its unbelievable OCR accuracy.  With a click and a choice I can now convert a PDF document into XL as spreadsheet.  Before this technology was created it was such a hassle. When I have to fill out a form OmniPage Pro 15 uses the saved information to help me. The program can run in the background and does not freeze or slow down my system.Edward Lampl President of Healthcare RecruitmentStuart Search Group
**things i liked about the programit supports importing ojb files, that i make in different modeling programsthe walking path editor works not too bad for simulated walkingand the rigs have good looking emontions when you moves there face features**what i found to be not so goodthe tabs such as the library and keyframe bar are kind of hidden on the side because of his small they are.  I find the slection tool in the hair room to be alittle bit annoying when trying to grow dynamic hair groups. i most of the time end up growing hair on too many facets.  the control points are too senative, they end up twisting the body in un-natrual forms. the rendering takes a very long, and the rendering shader doesent always save my settings. i end up transporting the animation to another program to render faster. some of the cloths i cant set them up to be childern to the body parts so they end up not being connected to anything. i'm sure there more on my mind by i dont have much time to write up an review. just keep in mind 3d animation isnt perfectly easy. a good modeling programs to make OBJ files will go a long way. 
This software is very user friendly,easy to install, easy to use.  I would recommend it to anyone
I have used Quicken for over 12 years.  Whenever I got a new version, it always worked for me.  But, it has too many things on it that I don't need. I like to keep it more simple for me, so I just use the register, reconcile, reports, and lists-catagories. For all I use it for, I am happy with it
Great product. I just received my ball today. I couldn't wait to work out. If I learn how to stay on it that would be saying something! I will always recommend Max-Fitness
My physician told me to exercise or else, so I looked at Comsumer Reports and listened to friends who spoke of a recumbent bike. Amazon's  price was great and I have been delighted. If you like to read and exercise, this one's for you
I bought this mat for my exercise bike.  It was large and gave my floor great protection.  I would recommend this mat to anyone that has exercise equipment
On the basis of the first review here, I ordered this bike and couldn't be happier with it.  This is the first piece of exercise equipment I've ever tried that is worth the space it takes up. I use it every day
It had special meaning for me, because when my two daughters were little (they are now in their late 30s), I taught them to flush finally by telling them there was a toilet monster that would come out and get them if they didn't flush.  I caught them both with the Toilet Monster joke and it was quite funny and led to some fond reminiscences.  It is more funny than scary, though it does give you a start when you first open the lid
I BOUGHT THIS BIKE FOR MY SON FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE LOVES IT!  NO PROBLEMS WITH IT SO FAR, IT IS BUILT WELL AND THE PRICE WAS AWESOME.
This is a fantastic product at an incredible price. I am amazed by the quality and the free shipping makes it even better. It has completely eliminated my lower back pain, the chiropractor never did that. Buy this table
I purchased the Valeo 10lb medicine ball for my son who is training for basketball. This ball has a very durable rubber covering and has some bounce to it.  This ball also has the same bumpy grips and dividing lines like a basketball.  Plus it is the same size of an official size men's basketball.  Color is also very nice
It's an ok knife. That picture of it can trick you. If you look at the middle of the page, it says "we ship black if we are out of silver". Don't get me wrong, black knives are cool but the handle for it is like some kind of green. The odds of actualy getting the silver knife is like winning the lottery, so I hope you like black weapons. The tip of it is silver if you look at it closeley. Just try not to poke an eye out. When will you need a LED light on a sword??? Unless your fighting ninjas in the dark. Do you know why this weapon is so cheap? I think that it's shipped from over seas so it may take a while to arive. Just don't challenge your nextdoor neibor to a duel to the death the day after you buy this and you should be fine. P.S. If you're looking at my account name, I am not neil meislin but I am related to him.
This knife's single blade, a bottle opener, nail file, and two flat-head screwdrivers (one large, one small) come packed in a slimline aluminum case. There's a can opener, too--though I've never tried to use it--and a panel on one side that can be engraved. It's an elegant package and lightweight. Once you're used to this little buddy, you won't want to carry the standard red plastic version.The only caveat: Don't take this to the airport. It will be confiscated. NOTE: To avoid losing it, you can attach a cord or thin chain to the small ring at the end. With this, a woman can attach her knife to her purse, and will be automatically reminded to return it when the task is done. A man can attach the chain to a belt loop. Until I did this, I had several "walk" after lending them to someone who needed a knife "just for a minute."
I was looking at the bigger cargo boxes but everything seems so big and heavy.  I need a cargo box that I can put up alone on top the Acura MDX-just the right size.  The box was easy to assemble - less than an hour.  It is also easy to attach to the vehicle.  The box looks like the more expensive boxes on top of my vehicle and color matches well with my silver MDX.  I just wish the plastic was a little thicker but I think it will hold up well.  The box is sturdy after assembling i
great. if you need more mags, get this, it fits perfect. it is exactly what it says it is
...so make sure you have one or you will be doing this all by hand, not to safe. Missing file holder is the only reason I don't give it five stars
I ordered this for My daughter when she played t-ball. She played on the cubs team and it was great. Very durable, and adjustable
the trampoline itself is very hard and good condition for its size.but the blue cover for the edge which is round  i will rate it a 1  is very poor for the price paid for.yes, it boke already that is the blue cover for edge and i had it for at least 2 weeks on.
The bad news first: The extension cables are VERY stiff, and they're shipped in a tight loop. Don't expect them to straighten out easily. And they don't come with extra clips to attach them to the foot straps. I just swap cables from whichever Bowflex station I'm not using and get a much better feel. The ball ... is a ball. It does the job. The little pump they supply with it isn't great, but it also does the job. Maybe you'll tone your arms pumping up the ball. ;-) There's no check valve in the ball, so be prepared to get the pump out and the plug in FAST, once it's fully inflated. The mat looks a bit cheap, but it's comfortable and it does keep you from sliding around.The video is decent. Even if you already know what you're doing, it's worth watching to see how to do the moves using a Bowflex.So far, I wouldn't say you've even come close to justifying the purchase price. But those foot straps are just BRILLIANT! Once you've gotten them adjusted, they'll go on and off with no problem, making it easy to add stretches to a regular workout without losing your momentum. But once you have them secured they won't come off, or even shift much, when you're performing the exercises. That may sound like no big deal, but I've used straps that took forever to put on and wandered all over the place while doing the movements. The four points for cable attachment are well-placed and solid. I've been doing resistance stretches for a LONG time, and these are the best straps I've ever used. They're worth the price of admission
Very satisfied to find this speedometer available.  Perfect to put with my Schwinn Cruiser Deluxe 7.....had been searching for something like this for awhile. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for retro gear
this gun shoots hard and fast!!!this is a metal gear box so it last forever!!!This is a must buy!!!believe me i know about airsoft guns and this is good!!
This little device is easy to put together and easy to use.  Not for 'intensive' workouts however, you can pretty much use it anyplace you're sitting down.  That could mean even while the TV is on!  Like all exercise equipment, if you don't use it you lose it
I bought this helmet for my 3 year old.  He likes it, it seems to fit well, seems to adjust fairly easily, received good reviews from Consumer Reports.  The only thing I don't like about it is the chin straps seem to twist a little bit between the ears and chin.  My son hasn't complained about this being uncomfortable, but it looks like it might possibly be.  I can't see any way to straighten them out all the way from ears to chin, it's just the way they are attached to the helmet.  Generally though, I am very happy with it.Oh, another thing, in the photo, the helmet looks almost red, white, and blue.  It's really dark gray and black.  I think the photo doesn't show this actual helmet but the design (style and stars) are the same
Arrived just in time for the snow, my grandson who is 9 had loads of fun, however,it requires the user to have good balancing skills, like a skateboard. I would have given it a 5 star but it could have been faster had the plastic footing been a little thicker to eliminate the base from warping up in the middl
I bought this bottle after reading a review that claimed it kept ice for 24 hours.  My girlfriend unwrapped the box on Christmas day, and filled it that afternoon.  It had ice still 2 days later.  Sturdy, effective, and comfortable to drink from.  I'm going to buy myself one too.
Can't really go wrong here.  A metal post, some rubber grips, and a couple of wheels.  It works great, and was the cheapest I found.  Just a tip, if you've never used it before, don't try to be a tough guy and do a rep from your feet.  You may be tough, but you might also hurt your back.  Start on your knees until you know for sure you're a tough guy
This litle gadget has come in handy on a number of occasions.  It's collapsable, strong, light and easy to use.  I wish the price was under $[...], but the best price I could find was on Amazon.com and it's what my wife wanted and loves.  We also bought one each of these for our grown children and they use them constantly.  A GOOD PRODUCT!!
this is perfect! the purple is a dark purple and my girl loved it! there's no confusing this scooter with her sister's (which is pink). she loved it and can't wait to get it outside to ride all day. thanks
Short review:  This combo is an exceptional deal.  For the price you get three callaway balls and a swiss army golf tool.  Alone the swiss army tool is over $30-35 bucks
If you can stick to a workout routine, this home gym is perfect for you.  After a bit of assembly, you'll be able to do all your exercises at home
they do not squeeze my ears and head and the diopters finally let me see well
The Eureka kids 30'grasshopper is an awesome sleeping bag, and a great value. We have two girls ages 6 and 8 who we purchased the sleeping bags for. On an week long camping trip in early spring twice the temperature dipped into the thirtys, and once into the low thirtys. Our girls stayed toasty warm and comfortable in their grashopper mummy bags. These bags also pack well, and have a good zipper. For the money these bags simply can't be beat.   
Great way to get rid of stress in the office.  Suction cup bottom works extremely well. 
This kit also includes a speed bag!! The item description never mentions that.  Which is awesome, but I already ordered one because I thought this didn't have it.  However it is a small speed bag so keep that in mind.  The bag gloves are very "budget" just like they state. So I doubt they will last long.  The heavy bag is fully packed, so the box is about 70lbs.  Other than that this is an exceptionally good value esp. with the free shipping
IT IS A GREAT FOOTBALL BUT IS HARD TO GRIP IF YOU DON'T HAVE REAL LARGE HANDS AND IS SLIPPERY
Most "replica" type weapons in this price range are just made to sit pretty on a shelf or wall, not these. Made out a single piece of stainless steel, these are very solid knives. As the previous reviewers stated, these do come very dull, but a file, a sharpener and a couple of hours can fix that. Once sharpened these knives are very useable
As a hobbyist woodworker who works primarily with hand tools, I've had to learn how to put a razor edge on things like plane blades and chisels.  While I've managed to master that skill (can shave hair off my arm with these tools), putting a sharp edge on my kitchen knives has been a nightmare.  I've tried numerous methods, none of which has worked well.About a year ago, I puchased the Spyderco sharpening kit.  Read the manual, watched the DVD, put my kitchen knives to it, and......ended up with pretty dull knives.  Frustrated, I put this kit in a kitchen drawer.Fast-forward to last week.  The kitchen knives are dull again, and none of my sharpening systems work on the knives.  So, I pulled out the Spyderco again and gave it another try.  This time, I tried sharpening my serrated bread knife.  After just a few strokes, it was good as new.  So, I tried it on the straight knives again, but only got a modest increase in sharpness.  Now convinced that some of my kitchen knives are made from inferior stainless steel, I tried sharpening my Swiss Army Knife.  Again, after a few stokes on the Sharpmaker, I had a wicked sharp knife.I was down in the workshop today, sharping my plane blades and chisels.  The last plane blade to sharpen was for a scrub plane...the blade on these is very convex, so sharping it is always a challenge.  Fortunately, it does not need to be super sharp, and never has been.  The Sharpmaker was sitting out, so I said "what the heck", and gave the scrub plane's blade a few freehand strokes on the Sharpmaker...no sharpening jig to hold the blade like I normally use.  For fun, I tried to shave hair off my arms....AND IT WORKED!  I couldn't believe it...this Sharpmaker makes sharpening TOO easy!It's American-made, very well thought-out, and works amazingly well when your blades aren't made of junk steel.  What more could you ask for?  
This is a quite good item.  I looked at a number or similar items on amazon and this one seemed caught my eye.  It certainly does make drinking from a nalgene or similar (mine is actually from a different maker, but of the same style) much easier.  My only qualms are that it is slightly expensive for a simple piece of plastic.  Also, it is a little irritating to have to take it out and replace it everytime you want to refill the bottle.  You can fill over it I suppose, but it reduces the flow rate so that you have to fill much more carefully and slowly which reduces one of the advantages of having a large mouth bottle.  I also kind of wish that there was an easier way to access the lip of the bottle than having to unscrew and rescrew the top each time, but that is a general issue with the bottles, not this lid.  But overall, a very useful purchase
I have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best. The thickness (1/8 inch) is just perfect - not too thick so it's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning. What I really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip, in a word, it is comfortable. 
I bought this for myself to play with (I'm 35) and after all the presents were opened and toys, video games, and everything were forgotten (about 4 hours after Christmas), this was the ongoing favorite of the season.  Everybody, younger (down to 8) and older (to 45) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching. It's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such.  This is a GREAT present for 11-18 boy. Fair warning though, there will be some good spills on the fairly short, steep learning curve - helmets, knee pads, blah, blah, are a must (and a video camera!
I bought this for my brother, he loved it! I was worried that it is a little big, but apparently fisherman have a lot of stuff :-)He said it was just right
I'm currently in Iraq and I ordered this bike, although it took a while to get it (not uncommon in a package that is 90 percent medal) I was happy when finally I recieved it. I had a little trouble putting the brakes on and warped the alumimum screws that hold the brakes cables to the levers. After my small mishap I was on my way riding in 30 mins or less. I've had the bike for about three months or more and it has stood up to all sorts of terrain and weather. During the summer tempertures can reach 130 during the day and I had no issues with paint or the mechanics period. Now its the winter season and tempertures drop down to 30 and it rains often; still no major damage or issues other than a little rust on the four screws holding the handle bars in place. I've taken this bike threw rocks, dirt, asphalt, and plenty of sand. After a quick spray with the hose and wipe with a dry rag the bike is just as glossy and bold as the day I took it out of the box. Overall I am very pleased with this bike and plan to bring it back to the States with me when my tour is up
Expensive, but I use it for aerobic and occasional high impact exercises as well as yoga. Very satisfied
Purchased for a Christmas gift. The larger wheels and stronger construction was just what my son needed. He had the orignial A scooter for several years but is now a teen and was in need of a new razor with stronger construction. He was also wanting the wheely "kick" bar over the back wheel. Overall, the A3 gave him everything he needed to continue enjoying "the Razor." Kick stand would have been a nice addition to this model but no big sweat..can just be one more thing to break in my opinion.  Price on Amazon couldn't be beat. Price was by far the best from a host of on line sites I checked. Shipping was great deal and came quickly, within 3 or 4 days after ordering it just a week before Christmas! In the word of my son "Santa be very very good to me!
what are you waiting for? quite reading my review and get this great scooter
I never found the fork part of a spork to be very useful. Now we have this Light My Fire spork, and I have to wonder why nobody thought of this before! Nearly perfect for typical backpacker meals - probably MRE's too. If you've a friend or relative "over there", send 'em one
This ab machine focuses your workout on the abdominal muscles like not many other ab machines do.  You'll be surprised by the results
We pruchased this tent for our annual car camping trip in Northern MI, where weather is very unpredictable.  We've had other tents that took FOREVER to set up, but this one was super simple.  I think it too two of us less than 15 minutes to have it up and ready.  We loved the size of this tent - plenty of room for our air mattress and gear.  The air circulation was great, too.  Even in the heat of the day, we had a nice breeze keeping us cool, thanks to a miriad of windows.  When rain came during the night, we stayed dry, though I would recommend sealing the seams prior to using this tent.  Overall, we're really happy with this tent (especially for the price!), and plan to use it for several years
No, this gun isn't very powerful - but THAT'S THE POINT. This gun is perfect for a young kid to learn about guns.  Slow enough you can actually see the BB, accurate enough to hit a target routinely at around 20 to 25 feet
I recently returned from almost 3 weeks of treking around Italy. I'm not a runner (or a walker, or even mildly aerobic) and I have baby-tender feet, so I was very concerned about blistering. On the advice of some runner-friends, I bought BodyGlide and coated my feet with it EVERY DAY before I put on my socks and shoes. My feet were tired and achy every night, but NO BLISTERS!! This is an amazing testament to the power of BodyGlide because sometimes I can have blisters wearing normal shoes during a normal, low activity work-day, and I was walking for hours at a time over bricks, cobblestones, you-name-it. If you are going to be traveling where you will be walking more than usual or on a differnt terrain then you are used to, buy a big, ol stick of Bodyglide and coat your feet every day
Hand wraps were sent quickly and were in good condition.  Thanks
A friend who is a successful competition mountain bike rider asked me to weigh the Blackburn Airfix after I bought it. He has had many occasions where his chain has broken, or his tires have punctured, so he wanted to compare the weight of the Blackburn versus the weight of all the individual tools he carried when he rides. The Airfix weighed in at about 245 grams - about 8 ounces - and his tools, including inflator, tire levers, hex wrenches and chain tool (all included in the airfix) tipped the scales at 337 grams - about 11 ounces. I suppose that a multitool may not be as convenient to use as individual tools, but for handiness, this seems hard to beat. The Blackburn lifetime/no-questions-asked guarantee is also very attractive.So while I have yet had to put this tool into action with either my Trek 2200zr or my Trek 6000, in a world where every ounce of weight is a heavy concern, pardon the pun, I imagine I have made a wise purchase
I just ordered a pair of these for my son, since my daughter is so pleased with them.  The wheel base is wide enough that beginners can get their balance quickly.  The wheels roll very smoothly.  The velcro attachment at the top provides ankle support, and is easier to adjust than just laces.  A fun outdoor activity!Laurie, mother of Emma (8) and Kevin (11
Awesome, for an advid user in Pedometer, I really love this one.    It is accurate and consise, some other pedometers out there have many complicated menus.A Women`s Viewwww.cosmopolitangirl.co.u
If you need to eliminate chafing from runing, jogging or just active walking, this is the stuff to use. Rolls on like deodorant. One application will last for a whole day. Highly recommend
This is a good size cot for a smallish boy scout.  It's a little small for an adult, but it fits in the tent well. The only complaint is it requires a lot of strength to set up and take apart, but it is lightweight and comfortable
I love the procuct and it does provide the  reslults predicted.  However I would like to see the band width widden a couple inches or I would like to see something like this maybe in a vest/shorts combination to achieve the same results on my chest and upper stomach
 I am a dedicated martial artist that has been frustrated in my attempts to attain greater flexibility. Despite my previous instructor's claim that these types of machines are a waste of time & money, I decided to investigate the potential effectiveness of the "Versaflex". Based on this investigation, I purchased this machine & in the very short amount of time that I have used it, I am really happy. For me it makes stretching very relaxing & comfortable. I am very impressed! 
I am very happy with this jump rope.  It was very easy to adjust to my height.  I have not jumped rope in years and wanted something new to add to my workout.  I am enjoying this jump rope very much.  It is very light and user friendly.
Its better then shakin the bottle, jams atleast once per fill but its only .89c !! Buy a few and you'll survive. Slam On !!!
I bought 3 of these for holiday presents this year and everyone loves them! Inexpensive but not easy to find. I was told easy to use. My dad labelled 2 boxes of balls on Christmas morning
I had trouble getting water in my ears before wearing this cap.  Now no problem!  It keeps my hair fairly dry, or at least drier than with other caps I've tried.  It's easy to put on and take off--no hair pulling.  It's lasted well so far.  Much better than wearing a cap with a chin strap. 
First off, let me start by saying that I really like my Summit watch.  It is large (some may go so far to call it HUGE) but it is surprisingly lightweight on my wrist, and quite comfortable to wear.  Those with bad eyesight will STILL be able to see the easy-to-read digital readout of the time, barometric pressure, altitude and compass.  The numbers are quite big, so they are difficult to miss.  The altitude reading measures in increments of +/- 1 foot, which is about as good as you can get.  I like that.  But what I really like about the Highgear watches that I haven't seen in other brands which offer similar features, is the visual image on the face of the watch telling you what the weather conditions are or will be.  No kidding, this watch will actually show you whether or not it is sunny, partly cloudy, or raining.  Pretty dang nifty if you ask me.  The barometric pressure reading is only a small part of predicting the weather, however after months of use, I have to say that my little watch is WAY MORE accurate than my local TV Weatherman.  I'd say somewhere around 75% of the time what my watch says is exactly what the conditions actually ARE.  Not bad.  It's a feature I would VERY much like to have on my Suunto and Casio models with similar functions.  Until then, I'll rely on my trusty (and much cheaper) Highgear Summit.If you are considering making the purchase of a wrist watch that offers the digital compass, altitude and barometer functions, before MAKING that specific buy, do some homework and wherever possible, seek out a store where you can actually SEE the watches in person.  Being able to guess the size of a particular model using a picture on the computer can possibly mess up your purchase.  Find the best price, and pull the model out and actually TRY IT ON before you buy.  For me, the Highgear Summit was a good purchase -- however if you would rather enjoy these same functions but in a smaller package, try the Highgear Axis, or possibly the more stylish but much more compact (and WAY MORE expensive) Suunto Observer.  Either way, doing a little homework will pay off in the end.  Happy hiking and I hope this helps you in your efforts to buy the right product.  Good luck
I used mine for two weeks snorkeling in Hawaii. It isn't perfect. It does take on a little bit of water sometimes when you go below the surface, but it isn't enough to cause any problems.It is pretty easy to clear by just giving a hard quick blow. You probably won't find anything better
I don't usually select items by &quot;name brand&quot;, so I tried many other boots before I tried the Timberlands.  But none seemed as well constructed or was as comfortable.  I have had them for 4 months and they have proved waterproof (in rain and puddles, thus far) and have shown very little wear
There's not a lot of information out there on using this extractor for cars, because I think most people buy it for boats instead.  So I'm going to talk about how well it works on changing the oil in your car.In summary, it works great.  It's really nice being able to change your oil on your own time and at your own home without getting dirty.  I'm never going to Jiffy Lube again.  It even works great on my lawnmower.Using the extractor is very easy.  Just remove your dipstick, insert the extractor's tube into the dipstick hole until the end reaches the bottom of the oil pan (it might take some practice to get a feel for this part).  Once everything is in place, pump 10-20 times.  This will cause a the extractor to suck out the oil like a straw.  It takes about 15 minutes for 3 quarts.  That's also why I recommend the 6-liter model instead of the 2.5-liter one, so that you can suck out all the oil in one shot.Some people wonder whether all of the oil is removed this way.  Unfortunately, I can't really speak to that, because that would require me to open the drain plug and investigate.  However, the consensus from stuff I've read on the Internet is that the extractor does remove as much oil as the traditional method.Because changing my oil is so easy with the extractor, I always change my oil on time.  Previously, I drove for thousands of miles past my "due date" because stopping for an oil change was too inconvenient.  The extractor should be used after the engine has been running.  The oil is less viscous and the contaminants are stirred up, making the extractor more effective.Also, please remember that your old oil must be properly recycled.  Most mechanic shops will accept your old oil (I put it in a plastic orange juice container), just call ahead to make sure
After polishing alloy wheels I treated them with Boeshield. It leaves a waxy film that attracts dust and dulls the finish, however there is no sign of tarnish or oxidation. Very easy to clean off when you want really bright wheels
I thought the speedsafe was a button that you press which flings the knife open.  I was dissapointed to find that it is just a spring that helps it open faster.  Other than that, this knife is ultra high-quality, definately the best I have owned
The one I bought is green and black - looks good in the water. I first look this kayak (dingy really) out into the Gulf of Mexico. The swells were two two three feet and the harder I paddled the behinder I got. I thought I had made a bad purchase but then I took the dingy into Clearwater Bay with much calmer waters and I'm having the time of my life. Paddling is slow going - 2 to 3 miles per hour at most but I've gone a couple of miles and back all along the bay. I bought a Coleman pump that runs on 4D batteries and I can inflate and deflate it five times before I need to change batteries. This kayak is the best $70 I've ever spent. Great exercise too
I already owned a Fenix P1 which amazed me with the impressive light it threw from something so tiny.  It was easily small enough to fit on my key chain and so it is always with me.  Even a great light source is useless if it's not accessible when you need it.  I owned a Surefire Ultra which is a great flashlight but obscenely expensive.  But you could feel the quality and knew it would last a few decades.  I love the rear clicky button design and the 5 levels of light.  I expected some similar design elements in this new Fenix. I was disappointed to see that to switch to the different settings you have to screw the collar left right, then left right again and so on.  So if there is one setting you use most often, you must go through the whole 5 turns just to get back to it next time.  Come on, that's just stupid.  I will keep it only to avoid the exchange hassle and it still is a good value considering the size and light output especially compared to the uberpriced surefires.  But there is no comparison as far as construction or quality. So 4 stars is all I could muster for the crude setting selection method design and the adequate but toylike feel of the casing construction. 
The kids at our church campout had a great time with the Aerobie SkyLighter Lighted frisbee's we bought for them.  They took a pounding and one spent the night in the pond and still continues to work.
Had this device for 3 months, absolutely love it! The chest strap you must wear in order to detect your heart rate takes a little time to adjust to, but it is very accurate. The most useful feature offered that is not included in many heart rate monitor devices on the market is being able to keep track of the distance you ran, the speed (max and average), and calories expended. This allows you to control your pace while running by speed, or because some days your body may react differently to exercise and may fluctuate; you can change your training accordingly with the heart rate monitor function. You are also able to easily program the watch so that it will alert you once you've reached a target heart rate, or time, or speed, and even resting rates, laps, etc., essentially letting you program your interval training. Distance is very accurate once calibrated manually. Never owned a gps based heart rate monitor before, but I chose this the gps based hrm because I need reliability (according to some reports on gps based hrm, the gps signal is weak when running in places with trees or tall buildings). Besides, if I get lost, I figure the extra running can't hurt me =
I bought one of these for friends that have children, and one for a friend who is married without children.  They all seemed to love it! 
I bought this for when I work on my car/motorcycle in my apartment building's parking lot. The lighting is poor, and I've found headlamps to be an absolute necessity.I bought this one because it seemed to have the properties I was looking for- a wide, even swath of light for close-in handy work. After comparing to several other lights on a site that is easily findable by searching for "flashlight reviews", I decided on this one.Having bought it, I actually wish I had gone for the Princeton Tec Quad. The thing is- this headlamp is extremely bright. It has two buttons to select the light output- one chooses between using all 8 LED's, 5, 3 or just 1. The other chooses between full output, "dimmed" output, and a flashing mode. Even with 5 LED's on the dimmed output, there is plenty of light for me to see what I'm doing. The reason I say it's *too* bright is that with 3 AA batteries, it's kind of heavy. Basically, I wish I had went for the Quad, which has 4 LED's and traded off the excess light output for something lighter and more comfortable
First off this gun shoots a mile !!!  I hit my friend in the head.  It left a welt the size of a 2 quarters!!!!!!!!!!!  If I was you I would bey this gun!!
I had concerns when I ordered this machine. Like the fact that I am so short. I didn't know if it would be designed for taller people. It worked fine for my height as well as my husbands height. (I am 5') I also had concerns because I have arthritis but I was able to do this without causing flare ups all the time and I am able to set goals and get a decent workout. I am able to adjust the machine to more difficult tensions so this is something that will last a very long time for me. The only drawback that I have found with this machine is that it hurts the toes a bit. Mine are starting to get use to it a bit. This machine is worth the money. I would highly recommend it to anyone especially those suffering with bone disease such as I am. It is a wonderful way to get healthier without compromising on pain
This is a better stroller than the other three (all for one child) strollers we have. Very maneuverable and adjustable. It turns on a dime and seats adjust up and down independently. Folds down very quickly. It's great that the kids can sit next to each other.
GREAT alternative to sugar. The FDA clearly doesn't care if we become diabetic, so we have to care for ourselves. This is a good part of God's creation being used for its designed purpose. Plus, the company was quick to get it to me and it arrived as promised. Great experience. I will buy again
Kids love this quarter pipe.  However, did not ship in a timely fashion due to amazon delay in ordering and had NO directions.  Luckily a friend had almost the same thing and we pretty much figured it out after a phone call to the company.  It did take a while to assemble
This - along with a pogo stick and stilts - was my effort to get my kids offf the video games at least some of the time! I thought this might be too hard for the 6 year old, but he persisted and is getting better at it. The point is, it's so fun he keeps trying! The 13 yr old - and my 17 year old daughter are enjoying it too. There seems to be a trade-off between the stilts and the hit-a-way. Only the little guy can handle the pogo stick - go figure
This kit will not only help you get started, it will help you stay with the program too
USE THE XL MOST EVERY DAY AND FIND THAT IT DOES A FAIRLY GOOD JOB FOR WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. ONLY USE IT ABOUT TEN MINENTS AT A TIME SINCE I AM 72 I DONT OVERDUE IT. CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN MY ABDOMEN ALREADY
Loved this mat! Great for taller yogis.great tickness too...A bit slippery but after a couple of sessions it wears offI totally recommend it! 
I am very happy with my choice. It is just the right size, nicely finished with glossy black paint, installs in a minute. Usage is very convenient: it has that perfect click-into-place property: you push down on it with your forefoot and it snaps into the "stand" position. To "hide" it when you are ready to go, just hit back with your heel or simply start pedalling and it snaps back along the frame. It does the job perfectly and it feels great
My kids got these from Grandpa.  They love them!  They're fun to bowl with in a dark room.  We've clipped them onto headboards for a decent-sized reading light.The problems: The clip is pretty hard to operate, even for an adult.  Also, the plastic base broke on each of our lights (in different places), so now they're clip-less.  They're still well-loved and well-used by the little guys, though.  I recommend these lights, but be careful w/ the bases
these roller blades are great they weren't to expensive and they are sooo comfortable they are fast and they are great to learn on and now i'm doing 420 to krooked grind to 270 out. I recomened to everybody that they should buy these and you will get total satisfaction the only bad thing about these blades are that they are a little ugly but they still work really well.
My wife and I put this thing together in about an hour.  There was one cracked foot tread, but after calling Schwinn, we had a replacement within two days and no hassles.  If you are looking for a decent machine at a great price, this is a nice one.  It is fairly sturdy and has some nice preprogrammed workouts
The display didn't work on the first rower we got, and one of the wheels on the front of it was broken.  Amazon sent out a new one the day I reported the problem, and helped me get UPS to pick up the damaged one.  The second rower arrived in good shape, and works fine.  The different programs are nice, it's extremely quiet, and my wife likes it better than the air rower we use at the Y.  The slightly padded seat is also a bonus.  One of the most important features for us was the heart rate monitor.  It comes with the chest strap, and displays heart rate on the LCD screen so you can vary your workout to stay in the target zone.  The heart rate monitor is not available on inexpensive rowers, and with some of the more expensive ones, you still have to buy the chest transducer separately.  Overall, quite satisfied with the rower, and because of their excellent customer service, extrememly satisfied with Amazon
This very comfortable strap can be put around your wrist or ankle and when you do the exercise, you can just concentrate on the muscle you're working and not have to worry about the theraband slipping.  It's terrific
This is a great pair of swimming goggles.  I swim a couple of times a week and I can't see a thing without my glasses.  This pair is very comfortable and does a great job correcting my vision.  I can't imagine swimming without them.  They have a wide field of vision, the adjustment is easy to use, and stays adjusted.  I've never had a problem with leaking.  For less then twenty dollars you can't go wrong. They are the best goggles I have ever owned.  Much better then the other brands.  Also, I recommend going slightly less then your current prescription, as the water will magnify things.
I've had this knife and their rainbow leak model for few years. All I wanted was a thin, small and light knife and I got it. The blade material is hard enough to stay sharp for a while, soft enough to easily sharpen but not brittle like a ceramic or carbon steel knife for example. I have had the vary tip break a couple times but it's because I was doing something foolish with it (like using it as a throwing knife *wink wink* ;) ). It's not the best, it's not the worst but can compete with ether, witch is the best in my opinion. Shortly after I bought it the speed safe spring broke, eehhh who cares it opens fine without. It's vary well made it can take all of my fat butts weight easily when laying sideways on a hard surface. It's vary thin profile is comfortable and I sometimes can't tell if I have it with me or not. It has what looks like brass or copper washers/bushings instead of cheap thin steel/plastic ones (means no binding up, even when in need of oil). The frame lock is far stronger than a line lock and best of all it deforms and wares much slower meaning my knife will stay ridged when opened for a long time.My favorite thing about it is the fact you can position the clip henge up or down. I chose henge down so it's ready to open the second it comes out of my pocket.If you want nice quality and availability for the price, kershaw is worth looking at
very nice flooring for the price. easy to put together. I use it as weight room flooring in an exercise area I have set up in my garage. If you are looking for aerobic room flooring, I would recommend buying the 20mm version
This cooler is the perfect fit and size for our boat! The compact size was the main reason for buying this cooler. The lid is easy to open and close and it doubles as an extra seat.  It keeps everything nice and cold all day on the boat. 
I already have a set of standard Bones Swiss, but since I was putting together a longboard with smaller wheels, I decided to get slightly faster bearings to make up for it.  These definately firt the bill, and the with the cheap $35.00 price and free shipping that Amazon offers, you can't go wrong.  These may seem dissappointing at first, but after about 3-5 hours of riding, they'll break in and go very fast.  Overall very reccomendable to anyone in the skateboard world
I am very pleased with Knife's . The vender was great. I ordered them and in 3 days I had them . Thank You all. TS
I bought this for my son (recommended by his special ed teacher) and the whole family has been using it ever since.  It's a nice, sturdy, trampoline and it's not too expensive.  The "folding" part is a little disappointing which I why it's not getting full stars.  However, we haven't needed to use that feature so it wasn't that important to us.  Overall this is a good quality trampoline for those who are looking for something less expensive
I am very impressed with the F4. It is very easy to use and a good basic heart rate monitor. It is easier to program than my F6, and it fits better.Polar makes the best HR monitors, and it works with all their chest straps - coded and uncoded, and even with ones that are not from them. I have Vision Fitness exercise equipment, and the strap works with their HR function. Sometimes I strap the watch to the equipment so I can read while I exercise, and I'm able to continually see the HR without constantly changing the view on the equipment.The color is more of a gray color than an ice blue, so it goes with just about anything you wear. I'm really looking forward to using this unit while I go out and do my walks this spring! I can't imagine buying anything else but Polar. This is my third watch and all three of them are still working well
This thing is great. Built tough as nails. There are myriad exercises for you to do from beginner to advanced as your core strength and stability improve. You won't be disappointed in the results if you stick with it. Get it. USE it.
I used to have a similar product, this one works the same except for one little handy detail: it doesn't stand on itself like the old one I had
I wonder why the other reviewer had leaking problems - perhaps a bad silicon seal?  I compared this in store to other products by thermos, no-names, etc, and it is one of the most solidly built food carry products I've ever seen or used.  I should have bought it years ago, and it would have saved hundreds of dollars via home-made lunches.  And jeez, the worry that every time you put tupperware/ziplock lunches in your bag, something is going to leak - how much is that worth to put to rest forever?  I used to wrap my food-carrying plastic wear in TWO plastic bags in case of inevitable leakage.  Never again.  This thing is solid.  I must admit, it appeals to my guy side, (see my bachelor-style typical lunch and dinner, below) with the hammered green siding and shiny metal parts.  I think I sprouted a few extra hairs on my chest after I bought it.  It looks like something you might dig out of the basement in your parents' house, to which they would say, "Oh, that used to be your grandfather's, and I used it too.  It still works."  They could call it the Man-Jar.  (Ladies, don't be afraid, the thermal properties are gender-blind, and green will be in this fall)If you got dumped recently by your girlfriend (or wife, or mom, or whatever), this jar can help you in your process of manly rediscovery.  Despite the fact that spending money is something I generally discourage, this jar will actually help you save money in the long run. You could carry it home late at night on the subway as a weapon.  Heck, my cooking is a pretty dangerous payload.Technical stuff:I put a heated hamburger patty and microwaved (prev. frozen) vegetables into the container, with a thermometer.  Started at 180 deg. F, and arrived at 140 deg. F four hours later.  I bought it before a 7-day road trip, living out of a cooler in the back of my car.  I didn't eat a SINGLE crappy fast-food meal, and I didn't spend a dollar on anything but gas.*  All healthy, pre-cooked, home-style, k-dog-style stuff.  Get yourself a Corning wear microwave bowl with a heavy-duty fridge plastic cover, and you have a home-cooked meal at every rest stop.I've put boiling water in it, let it sit overnight, with the top off, and it was still warm in the morning.  * And a hotel.  And a speeding ticket.  I musta been so excited to have this food bottle.  Damn ohio pigs
I've always loved Victorinox Swiss Army Knives, but I must admit that I when I purchased this one, I was not sure if I made the right choice, but my expectations were soon exceeded.  It was right before a trip to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota, I had lost my other Swiss Army Knife (a Tinker), and I was looking for a versatile knife with a locking blade.  I did not need dozens of other tools for my pending stay in the wilderness.  I settled on this one because it was on sale, and I have not been disappointed.The handle has a mild contour that made it very comfortable to handle.  For its size, it had just the right heft, but it was not too heavy to weigh down my shirt (where I kept it in my buttoned breast pocket).The 4" locking blade worked wonderfully.  I could close it with either one or two hands.  When closing it, the blade pauses at the halfway point, reducing the risk of closing it on your fingers when closing it one-handed (that said, it does not eliminate all risk, so close the knife with one hand at your own risk).  During my recent canoe trip, I lost my fillet knife on a portage trail and was surprised that cleaning a 24" northern pike with this blade was quite painless (though it did take some skill).Beyond the blade, I've always found the leather awl and the screwdriver handy, but the can opener blade is a primary reason why I prefer Victorinox Swiss Army knives over those produced by Wegner.The knife shipped in a simple cardboard box.  A sheath or pouch would have been nice, but I was able to fabricate one with duct tape before my trip.  Since I kept it in my shirt pocket for most of my trip, the sheath wasn't necessary, but it is one accessory you should consider purchasing if you choose this knife.I recommend getting one.  You will not be disappointed
I have bought over 20 of these knives.  I trim my nails, open packages, write notes, tighten screws, and strip wire (great for stripping wire).  You can buy replacement toothpicks and pens.  I put toothpicks in place of the twizzers.  I have never used the twizzers in 30 years.  I can use the toothpick a couple times a day.  I would love to see a thinner version with an LED, toothpick and pen. Airport security keeps taking my knives.  Remember to remove the pen and toothpick if they do take it.  The pen just pulls out. This is the best most used tool I have ever owned
Extra heavy, somewhat difficult to assemble.  Good quality.  Will hold 24 rods but not with reels attached, more like 12 rods/reel combos
Having used the Supra locks which I like a lot, I found the Master Lock key safe and tried it out.  It is VERY heavy duty, and holds much more than Supra.  The combo is easy to change (takes seconds) and it is VERY weather proof.  I like it better than the Supra except you must leave the combination dialed in to close it.  Someone could see it.  The Supra does not show which button(s) were pushed.  All things considered, I will be buying the Master Lock in the future.
Ordering this item was very easy and it arrive quickly.  We finally got a chance to use it to cut post for our fence we are putting up, it cut the job in 1/2!!!
I read the reviews before purchasing this electric blower. We have been very pleased so far with this blowers performance!! It is extremely powerful, quiet and easy to handle. I have been especially pleased when using the vacuum to suction up the leaf pile. It has been very efficient even when blowing or vacuuming up damp leaves. Although I was hesistant to buy electric and have to deal with the cord, it hasn't been a problem for us. I would recommend this product
The Bessey K-Body clamps are superior for multi-board and cabinet door glue-ups by keeping the pieces flat.  Wish I could have purchased the K-Body clamps instead of all the pipe clamps I own
This is a great flashlight, very bright for its size, very solid a great item indeed
This product is so great, so with the price, its a great bargain and so usefull around the house and in my cars
I ordered this blower/vac after reading many reviews on many different blowers. I must say that it is doing an outstanding job this fall! We have MANY deciduous trees and I was worried about cleanup this fall. The blower is powerful enough to move bulky leaves into a pile. It easily blows off the porch, concrete drive and gravel drive. The vac part works well and I am glad to have the metal impeller blade as I occasionally vac up small pine cones and liquid ambar balls with out damage to the blade so far... The mulching ratio may be correct with dry leaves but I find the damp or still fresh leaves only mulch to a 1:6 ratio - still not bad I a use the leaves for mulch and compost addition. I have not had a clogging problem with the blade.  It is a little loud (don't know how it compares to a gas one) and alot dusty and a bit heavy once the bag is full, but that is the nature of leaf cleanup!I am pleased currently - hope it works well down the road
These are great! You start out with a clean car, and every week or so you dust it, and wipe it down with one of these, even use the same wipe to wipeoff the brake dust off wheels and pipes. The above reviewer is right about the glass, but I always do that separate anyway. I drive a black muscle car and everybody thinks I spend hours on the car. The only problem.....I can't find 'em anymore
They are a little pricey compared to say the clamps at Harbor Freight, but once you use them you will know why.  They are superior in every way.  When you clamp with them the wood does not move around since the jaws are parallel.  And you can get tons of clamping force out of them.  Very nice tools
Very nicely done.  Brought it for my grand-daughter who is 5yrs old and it is sturdy and has room to gro
I can't say enough about Illustory!  My daughter is 6 and in Kindergarten and loved to make stories on paper stapled together. So, Santa brought her an Illustory kit and we did it together as she can't write many of the words yet.  So, she drew all the pictures and told me what she wanted to story to say.  We got our book in the mail yesterday, and she was so thrilled to see her story bound like a real book!  The quality was great, and it even had the dedicaton page and an "about the author" page with her picture (which I provided).  We even ordered an extra copy for grandma with a dedication to her!  I highly reccomend this kit
Both girls, ages 4 and 2 loved this
This toy is a wonderful first toy. It captures their attention and has all kinds of handles for them to grab when they're ready! I absolutely love it, and so does my son
     I always thought Clue looked like a complicated game I'd never touch!  That is until I played it at my friends house!  Now I'm a Clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions!  This game can never get old because it's a different outcome every time!  I strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older
My 28 month old son got this puzzle for Christmas and loves it.  He put it together the first time out of the box himself. It is the first thing he does every morning and then several times a day.  My almost 5 year old likes it too. It is not as sturdy as the Melissa & Doug floor puzzles, but it still really sturdy. 
Bertie is nice.  He has no magnetic pieces so he won't hook to other things.  Nice 16month old tries to use him on the train track which does work but he wasn't really meant for that and can be hard to push on the track
The doll looks nothing like the Aidan in the movie.  Actually, his face is kind of funny looking.  The movie Aidan is cuter.  The doll could definitely have been made better
This game set it of amazing quality. Every piece has so much detail it just looks good without doing anything! The Dubloons are the best part, and like others have said, make the BEST clinking sound when you drop a pile into your hand.This game is definately worth buying.... IF you come up with some new rules that make the game more interesting. The gameplay is very uninteresting, boring, and brainless. My wife never passes up an opportunity to tell me how boring it was, and even her younger (12 year old) sister thought it was boring and had more fun playing with the pieces. My wife says I should have bought us Settlers of Catan instead of spending my money on this (before we got our own set... now we have one), but when I bought it I knew it would be just for the game pieces. I am brewing up some good rules to change the gameplay dramatically and make it much more interesting. She likes Settlers so much.. maybe I will get some trade of spices into the game and whatnot.Anyways, if you are creative and have a good idea for a ship game, then DEFINATELY get this game set. It is high quality and beautiful. But, if you don't have the interest to make your own game, then pass this one up because you would most likely love to play any other game you own before this
My 5 year old twins really like this game...it is sometimes difficult to balance the toppings, but that is why they like it so much.  On the other hand, my 3 year old finds it very frustrating. If you are considering purchasing this for a younger child you can rough up the pizza part with a piece of sand paper to help with the slippage.
Gave this to my 6 year old for his birthday.  I helped him to construct it from the clear (no reading) directions along with my 10-year old daughter.  The pieces go together flawlessly - the engineering of the plastic is superb.  The elevator works as designed and the battery pack (2xAA) connects via a short cord - very convenient.  He has already spent many hours playing with it
Since I had always wanted a "mad scientist" lab when I was a girl and never got one, my husband purchased this for my 4 1/2 yr old son and I to do together.  Overall, it's been fun.  Everything but water has been included which is a plus.  The "lab" comes with interlocking pieces which can be assembled in a variety of ways.  I like this component because it helps children with problem solving, creativity and motor skills.  The kit also comes with recipie cards and its own measuring spoon and beaker.  It's really taught my son to learn how to measure.  However, the recipie cards tend to generalize and direct you to refer to other recipie cards, which my son would not be able to figure out without my help.  The steps on the cards come with both words and pictures which was a plus but they omitted some details that probably only a grown up would catch.  On the other hand, the "experiments" or recipies go from simple gelatin molds of bugs to more complicated creatures that progressively build upon previous experiments.  They also encourage creativity by giving further suggestions for mixing colors, flavors.  I was also pleasantly surprised at how well the "experiments" actually tasted for a toy kit.  On the other hand, if made as directed we found it difficult to actually fill the monster molds with the amounts directed on the "recipie" cards.  Overall, this was a great gift because it got my son and I to spend some fun time together
I bought my girls, ages 7 and 4, this product earlier this spring. It was easy to assemble, but finding the right height at which to hang it was a fairly time consuming process.  It has been up for 4 months now and has seen daily use. When our play group meets here, the kids line up to have a turn, over and over again.  I would recommend this for children who are reasonably coordinated and who have enough upper body strength to hold themselves up by their hands.  A very durable product and a fun physical activity
I bought this car for my 4 1/2 year old son who absolutely LOVES the movie Cars.  He also loves those Hot Wheels cars.  I got him this car, and he really liked it.  In fact, all of my kids (ages 4-15) like it!  It's a really cute toy.  It's even great if you are a Cars collector
me and my BF loves this plug n play game "wheel of fortune", we bought it at target store. thumb up for this one and plenty of words.
We bought this toy for our 1 year old son.  It is very sturdy and well made and the blocks inside are great.  I agree with the other reviews that the wagon moves to fast on wood floors and it does not turn well.My biggest compaint, however, is that when both lids are closed, the wagon looks just like a 2-step ladder.  Our son constantly tries to climb it, like stairs.  The other day, he finally stood up on top of the wagon and the wagon tipped straight over onto the handle.  My son fell over with it and crashed on his face.  There are two rubber stoppers on the back of the wagon, but they DO NOT prevent it from falling over.My son is fine, but this toy is very dangerous and I do not recommend it!
I've been an Amazon customer for years, but this is the first time a product stood out enough for me to write a review. I bought this for my 8 yr. old daughter and I figured my 6 yr. old son could use it later. I was very hesitant, because there aren't a lot of reviews and it's expensive.Well, we've had it a few days and my daughter has been playing more with "Secrets of the Master Magician: An Apprentice's Manual", which I also bought at the same time (another great gift). My daughter is interested in this and it's easy for her to put things together.My son is obsessed with it! It's similar (for him) to the Lego creatures he puts together. He needs a little help from time to time, but he can certainly follow the very well laid out diagrams. So far they've created an FM radio, a scifi noise maker, a sound detecting space noise maker thingy, a propeller that spins and flies into the air, a seven segment display, a volt meter connected to the solar cell. After connecting the solar cell, I realized my son thought the solar cell would come on like a computer screen or TV! After explaining it and putting my hand over it; now they both know what a solar cell does. - There are 5 books of experiments. - Each project has a nice simple color picture of how to connect all the components. - All components are clearly marked. - The diagrams are a top view. Since the connections are layered on top of one another 2 and 3 deep, it takes a little figuring as to what's on top and what's on bottom. It's easy for an adult. It's part of the "puzzle" for the kids. After we put a few together, they both got it. - The pieces seem sturdy enough and snap together easily - There is great assortment of parts to create lots and lots of very interesting projects. - My kids love the projects. I've been very impressed. - It has a cable that you can connect to the microphone port of a PC sound card. I haven't played with this. There is software, it looks like you can turn your PC into an oscilloscope. Looks interesting. There's a whole book for these projects. I just saw the cover, so it's likely that there's even more to it.My kids are learning a lot with this. While they are putting things together, I can explain how these different parts work. There are lots of opportunities to take the project and modify it by replacing parts, change a light out for the speaker, etc.For example, my son put the 7 segment LED together. I wasn't impressed. I was hoping to put together a counter, but it just connects each segment to ground to turn all the segments on. There are 750 projects, so maybe there is a counter project. Regardless, my son was fascinated. He changed all the connections manually to count from 0 to 9. He changed the main power resistor to see it go brighter with a smaller resistor and dimmer with a bigger resistor. Lots of implicit learning going on. I pointed to the microwave display and said, "See, that's how it works!
My daughter rec'd this game as a gift for her fourth birthday.  It was wonderful because my son, who was two could play it too (with my assistance of course).  Now they are 5 and 7 and still play it.  It is a simple game that requires no reading skills and reinforces counting.  I would recommend it to everyone
truly wonderful!  My 4 year old son hasn't quit playing this game since Christmas
This update of the old Big Wheel style "Green Machine" is made to handle the height, weight and wear and tear of big boys (and girls, up to the latter 30s have even been caught on it), yet the seat is easily adjusted so that the average 5-year-old can reach its pedals.  The main cool feature is the dual lever steering.  Just like with the original hollow model plastic version, pulling on the steering levers in opposite directions sends the machine into a wicked spin-out that kids just can't get enough of.  Yet under the usage of some pretty crazy 6, 9 and 12 year olds on a steep downhill driveway, the machine has almost always remained three wheels on the ground.  So first, I am amazed at the staying play value of this toy.  For two years now, it has been the first toy out of the garage every time the door opens.  And second, I am amazed at its durability.  The 9 year old who uses it reguarly is an Evel Kneivel who is notorious for breaking my children's toys left and right, and so far, it has held up without a squeak.This was a million times better value for our hundred spot, than the darn motorized motorcycle we bought a couple years prior for twice that amount which only lasted a year before the gears stripped.  Definitely consider this for your 5-10 year old boy, even if he already has a two-wheeler.  It's a whole different kind of fun.***** all the way
My son is currently 4 months old, and this is currently his favorite toy. He loves to watch it, hold it, and chew on it with his gums
This is a simple pirate ship tub toy with two backyardigans characters. My pirate enthusiasts (ages 6, 4 and 2) love it. It doesn't move or make noise, but it floats well and is sturdy. The best part is that the characters fit in the bottom of the ship for easy storage
My son has played with these from 6 months old, and still likes them occasionally (18 months now).  The small car is nice for babies to shake.  They don't do much, but they are cute
Yasmin, one of the super-stylin' Bratz Rock Angelz, is in my possession! So, I'm sorry my reviews go in to EVERY LITTLE DETAIL(as one customer complained), but that's how I do it! So if you haven't bought a ticket to info-town, either get the heck outta here, or buy one by reading this review. HERE GOES!First off, Yasmin has blonde streaks flowing through her dark chestnut hair. Just like the other Rock Angelz(Cloe, Jade, Sasha), Yasmin's hair is awesome quality;smooth, great duraility, etc. That feature makes her great for younger kids because her hair can get messed up many times, then smoothen out. Yasmin has the liveliest color eyes of the Rock Angelz; emerald green. This works as both a strikingly gorgeous feature and hot highlight to the doll. Her lip color, pink, really stands out on the doll. And of course, as most other Yasmin's do, she has the warm cocoa skin color. She has dark blush and sparkles above her eyes.I absolutely adore her chocker. It is too cute! I'd definately say that her jacket has a 70's-80's rocker look to it. It's definately the best piece of clothing on this doll. Just beware that it's difficult to fasten the velcro in the back. The velcro on my Yasmin doll's jacket is practically coming off! Underneath her jacket, Yasmin sports an undershirt labled 'Rock Angelz', with the ever-so-famous red glitter included. Her jeans have no rips or anything. They're just jeans with white stitching, red glitter, a chain half-belt, and little frayed bits at the hem. Now don't get the wrong idea! Just because this doll has a chain, leather, frays, and a belly-jewel(so not a tatoo!), don't go thinking, "Oh no! This doll portrays an image of bad things for our 'little' girls!" She's just a cute rock star singing inspiring songs and wearing totally appropiate clothing. Now, of course, if you still think this doll is innappropiate, it's not my place to order you to buty this doll. I just wanted to epress my opinion;this doll is safe. Anyway, her black guitar is in the same mold as Cloe's red one and Oriana's purplish one. It's a little difficult to position her guitar correctly, but not thouroughly impossible. Her second outfit consists of sparkly mini and rockin concert tee. Yasmin's ankle boots match with both outfits. And I love the fact that both outfits are mix-n-matchable! It rocks! Literally! Her accessories include:glasses, 2 sets of earrings, cell-phone-necklace, bracelets, star brush, lipstick, microphone/microphone stand, and totally-collectible displaying stand!You've outta have a rockin' time with this rockin doll! She's 100% worth the price($19.99)! Fortunately, I got her for Christmas. In my opinion, she's appropiate and meets the standards of ALL ages(notice I stressed on the 'all'). You're lucky if you get her! GREAT JOB MGAE!Chelsea&Yasmin(50% My Scene, 50% Bratz)over, & OUT!!!!!P.S.-END THE WAR!!!-#1 Peacekeeper(Hannah)12 YEAR OLD FAN OF MY SCENE, BRATZ, BARBIE, AND POLLY
Every human should have one of these. Ideally, every human should have one of these in every size and color available. It doesn't get any better than Etch-a-Sketch. I have several of them in my office, and they're wonderful  for long meetings and work sessions
BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MT SON, AND HE JUST LOVES IT.HE PLAYS WITH IT ALL THE TIME, FROM THE TIME HE GETS HOMEFROM SCHOOL UNTIL DINNER TIME, AND FROM AFTER DINNER UNTIL BED TIME
This is a great house,got it at toysrus,has six ring tones at doorbell,dog,knock knock,jibberish,fog horn,etc.,it's so easy to assemble.all you need is a helper(to enjoy assembly)and a power or ratchet screwdriver(you need both)the stove is a little tricky to start but once you start the hole you can use a power drill!your child will love it.Swinging door/window,spongebob chair fits inside(you can probably get a big screen TV in there!)Great for the price $129.0
My son loves this toy.  It is the perfect height for my 14 month old (he got it when he was 12 months, and it was great then, too).  He can play with it sitting or standing.  He loves to make baskets, and I can teach him numbers as the scoreboard keeps his score.  He loves to spin the football, and he is starting to gain enough coordination to hit the ball with the bat.  He uses the bat it came with to hit other balls around the house.  This toy is a family favorite
This game is so much fun!!! I do think that maybe it could use a few more games or maybe make different difficulty levels. In other words... If you are a huge Star Wars fan like me, then you will love this game!!! It will keep you occupied for at least an hour a day if you are determined to beat a certain level. Another thing I think it could use is maybe a game-save function or something... Anyway, GREAT GAMING EXPERIENCE!!! One and a half thumbs up!!!
My 2yr old got this one and another Imaginext Dinosaur for Christmas and this one is by far his favorite. He loves attaching the cart to the Mammoth and moving them around. The reason why I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the button to push down on to make the noise is not real easy. When you think it's pushed down all the way, you have to push a little harder to get it to make noise. Also, like the last reviewer I think the wooly hair is going to attract dirt and not stay very clean. But overall the toy is fun and very durable
My 6-year-old got this for Christmas and he and his 4-year-old brother love it!  They enjoy doing the battles and coming up with different monster combinations.  It teaches strategy since they have to figure out which combinations work best.  My kids also like to just play with the figures by themselves like action figures.  A piece of advice though:  This game only comes with 2 figures so you really must buy additional figures or it won't be much fun since the point is to create varying combinations.  Therein lies the problem - or at least MY problem!  I can't find the extra figures for this thing!  Luckily, they were available around Christmas so I got some then, but now I can't find them in stock anywhere.  Also, I have not had any durability problems although I had some sound quality problems on the 2nd day.  Fortunately, it turned out that all I needed was new batteries. You really need alkalines for this game.  Overall, it's what my boys think though and they ADORE this!!!
The 3-D Solar System is great.  I rated it 5 stars because I knew there was no sun, so this product was exactly what I expected.  Easy to hang up, glows well, my 6 year old son is very happy with it!  A sun would be nice, but still well worth the money
Ok, this toy does not deserve 5 stars but the other reviews were far too harsh.  The first 30 minutes of my chihuahua terrified by this thing were worth the price.  As a stuffed animal it's very cute but not too cuddly because it's hard plastic under the fur.  I love scrat in the movie and the sounds this thing makes are quite funny at first but the do get boring soon unless you have a family pet to terrorize like I do.  Here's another trick.  Put Scrat on a pillow with your hadn behind him so you can make him move and wiggle his tail without being seen, then have someone bring in the family pet.  When I lunged at the dog's feet he screamed as being run through a meet grinder.  This may sound cruel but I assure you the dog was not hurt and now enjoys showing Scrat who's the boss whenever we turn him on
I was very pleased with this product, it covered the back seat and has a handy little pocket to put bottles,wipes,dipers in. I have brought another two for the other car
I BOUGHT THIS DOLL FOR MY 5 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER. SHE LOVE'S THIS DOLL AND TAKE'S IT WITH HER EVERY WHERE SHE GOES.PEOPLE ALWAY'S MAKE A REMARK HOW MUCH FUN THE DOLL IS EVEN GROWN UP'S WANT TO PLAY WITH IT.JUST MAKE SURE THE CHILD YOU GIVE IT TO IS THERE WHEN YOU SET HER UP, BECAUSE THE CHILD WILL HAVE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION'S THAT ALLYSEN ASK'S.SETTING HER UP WAS VERY EASY.SHE TRUELY IS A INTERACTING PLAYMATE.I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS DOLL
I brought this toy to aid my two-year old in learning how dress
The game is fun to play even if you're not a NASCAR fan!  Love it
I read the reviews before buying this product, and I do agree that it is messy with the markers, suitable for children that are a little older.  It is fun, and very cute, but a little messy to wash off.  I just buy a pack of baby wipes at the dollar store, and let the kids clean off the screen with them, and then throw them out.  It works wonderfully, and the problem is solved, since the included sponge is not very helpful.  I would purchase this again, especially for the price
This is a great doll--we gave it to our 2-year-old daughter last week and she now carries her everywhere, feeds her, reads to her, puts her to bed, covers her with a blanket, and obsessively pats her on the back and tush.  She's quite cuddly and soft; you'll want to hold her yourself.  You might expect from the pictures that the arms and legs would be hard plastic like the head, but in fact they are very soft and pliable, and the trunk of the body is all cloth, like a pillow, with a bean-bag tushie.  The headband is removable but actually stays on there pretty well.  The eyes don't have those stupid eyelids you usually see on baby dolls, the ones that open and shut when you lift the doll, and that always seem to stop working properly after a couple of weeks.  We'll see how "Maria" holds up to the kind of punishment our daughter can mete out, but she seems pretty durable.  What a great purchase!
This is a great,simple, fast game that is fun for all ages
This is a good toy for a toddler, not a baby. I've used this toy in two different setting (first as a nanny and then as a mom) and both times, the babies were terrified of it. It's just too much stimulation for a 9 month old. The balls fly everywhere and you've got to run about after them to keep it going; unless of course, you've got a toddler, then they can run about after the balls (which seems to be half the fun for them). Good toy, but not until maybe 14 months.
Although my granddaughter is in love with the Webkinz, I was upset at the fact...after just receiving it, the glitter string around the Unicorn's neck came apart from the Unicorn.  Still my granddaughter loves it
These are really cute and a great alternative to the standard "Numbers and Letters" version of these foam tub toys. My 2 and 3-year old sons enjoy playing with them. No complaints here
Great fun for the family or a group setting.  We've had hours of fun
My daughter is almost 3 and she LOVES her trampoline. She is very curious about how Santa got it down the chimney, though! Not easy to put together, but could be if directions were clearer. Great product, great price
My one-year-old son had a great time playing with these blocks ...  He loved the colors and shapes.  He really enjoyed knocking down my block creations.  We had such a good time playing with the blocks that I decided to go on-line to buy him some.  I was shocked at the price.  I cannot believe [what] these blocks cost ...  For thirty-two foam blocks?!?!?!?!  Forget it.  It's too bad that these blocks are cost restrictive; they're great fun, but not worth the price
My niece is about to be two and she loves school buses, so I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE WORTH A TRY.  She loved it... hours of fun and if you are patient you could fold it back up and put it back in the box
Santa brought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  She takes it in the car with her with her baby doll and belts it in with the seat belt.  One of the things I love about it is it isn't too heavy for her to carry.  She can carry it with her baby doll in it without any trouble.  It is also very sturdy.  She has even sat in it herself and it didn't break.  I would recommend this doll carrier.  It is great for little people who enjoy pretending to be mommy and daddy
This was the best stocking stuffer ever. And we got 4. One for each of us. Mine is know at my office, and my boss loves it
I bought this mostly for the container.  I had individual play-doh products, like the barber set that came in it's own box.  I'm able to put ALL play-doh things into this container and everything is in one spot.  No more boxes and sorting.  I even still have space for more things like different colors and everything.  My daughter loves the variety of the toys and I love the convenience.  I'm going to buy it for presents for other families I know! 
My two daughters (two and four) got this for Christmas from "Santa", after seeing this, they no longer had any interest in any other gift.  They love it and spend hours on in fixing each others hair
I first purchased the Winnie the Pooh Soft 'n Silly Tigger for my son when he was 4 months old.  He is now 14 months and LOVES his Tigger.  We now have 2 Tiggers, one as a back up, and he carries them everywhere he goes.  It's a great toy for young children to sleep with, being soft and cuddly.  Tigger has been a great comfort for my son and I don't know what I would have done with out them!
My children are 7, 5 and 20 months, and they all love it.  The baby is especially fascinated by it and was able to make the top spin by herself after her brothers coached her a bit.  The humming sound is much less annoying the many of their battery operated toys with voices and electronic noises
My three year old takes a "rest" instead of a nap, which means he stays in his room for a quiet time so mommy has some sanity.  He can't tell time, so he would come out every 5 minutes to see if rest time was over.  In order to keep him in there for an hour I purchased this clock so he can see and hear when his time was up.  It works perfectly and he isn't anxious about when his time is up.  He understood the concept of the clock changing from green to yellow to red quickly and knows when the clock is red that his time is almost up. I set the clock to announce when his time is up and then he comes on out. No more "is it time yet?".  I get my full hour of sanity uninterupted!
My son wanted this piece and we have enough of the other pieces to incorpate it into the track system we have started and my son loves it and plays with it so I have to say it has exceeded my expectation for the value it added to our GEO Trax railroad
both of my kids have a LeapPad and several books ... this is a great way to keep them all together.  It's durable and kid friendly--so they can keep track of their cartridges and books ... and it's great b/c they can just grab it and go which makes it nice for travel too
WE PLAYED THIS GAME WITH 3 COUPLES AND ALL OF US ENJOYED IN VERY MUCH WE LAUGHED THE WHOLE TIME IT WAS A VERY ENJOYED GAME FOR ALL
We learned about these blocks years ago when my now 13 year old was in pre-school.  I was amazed at how these seemingly simple pieces of wood, so totally enraptured these little kids!  Kapla, are 'blocks' that are all exactly the same size.  At first glance, they seem boring.  But once you start playing with them, they are so much more.  They can be made into all kinds of structures, and can even be raised higher than one can reach, without falling!!When our 'surprise blessing' turned 2, I pulled them out for him.  He enjoyed them (though at 3 he likes them much more), but what surprised me is that my older two (15 and 13) love playing with them as well!!  In fact, we ALL do!!  I know it seems like a lot of money to spend on these, but they are MORE than worth it!
My niece couldn't put this down after she opened it. She had lots of fundoing tricks for her relatives at Christmas. The components of the set are very good quality. I patted myself on the back for discovering this"winner" gift
As a brilliant, but ruthless leader of the Piraka, Zaktan thinks that working together is the way to find the ultimate treasure, the mask of life! All the Piraka have two tools. Yes, 2. Each one has a Zamor spheres which are small marbles that each one can shoot, but in real life they would be the size of basketballs. Zaktan's three-pronged blade is capable of cutting through metal. Nothing will get in his way, or it will be severely punished................
we saw this online and really wanted it, but decided to wait because of the reviews. well today we went to an outlet store that sells new stuff at huge discount prices, and it was only 10.00 my son has already ridden the heck out of it with no problems, and he loves it. we havent had to replace a fuse and it just the right size for my 1 and a half year old. its a really great little bike, but for the workmanship of it, i definitly wouldnt pay 50 dollars for it, maybe 30-35 most. we just got blessed with a really great deal:) so if ya want this for your kids, its great for the smaller rider, and just the right speed for him to control. hope this helps someone:
Murdoch is a mighty engine with ten drive wheels. He was brought to the Island to help with the heavy workload and pull freight on the main line. As shy as he is strong, Murdoch can often be found seeking peace and quiet. This wooden train is a 2 piece set, joined with magnets. My son loves playing with this mustard-yellow engine on his wooden tracks. Very sturdy construction, and a great addition to the Thomas line
I love this puzzle! It is fun and challenging. I believe that it is a good puzle for anyone who wants a challenge. However I find that there is one problem with it. THERE ARE NO DIMENSIONS TO TELL YOU HOW BIG THE PUZZLE IS AFTER YOU PUT IT TOGRTHER!!! I would appreciate it if dimensions were added to the box. I am sure that anyone else who purchases this puzzle would appreciate it to so that they know if they are going to have to purchase a puzzle mat as well if they order this puzzle. If you like puzzles that are not your everyday puzzle I would recommend that you purchase this puzzle because it would make a worthy addition to any puzzle collection
I love this nativity even though it I think it is pricey.  There are no other ones like it.  They are Fisher Price Little People so you know they will hold up forever!  There aren't any other plastic nativity sets out there. Get the set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the stable. It is so worth the price when you know they will play with it every year. I even take this to church when I teach my 3and4yr old class about Jesus birth.  They LOVE it
Damn! I just got the yostick and took it to the local gym and streets to demo some new tricks.  At first I had some doubts about the durability of it but after some heavy duty urban testing, it's still mad tricking.  In other words, I've been trying pretty hard to break it.  For it's price, the yostick is incredible fun.  In an age of pricey video-games, $10.99 is not a high price for something that provides exercise, fun and an introduction to the movement and breathing rhythms of martial arts.  A value-priced training tool, not a toy at all.  The movement required by the yostick will help martial arts beginners have fun while learning precise hand-eye controls.  The ends are fitted with rubber tips making it a joy to trick directly off the ground.  Looking forward to collecting other models. Enjoy It
I bought this bed for my two year old because he got too big for his crib.  He moves around A LOT in his sleep so I wanted a safe first bed for him.  He absolutely loves this bed and actually he is sleeping much better now than he was before.  The only problem was that the mattress and box spring we bought were too high, so we just use the mattress for now. Eventually we'll put the box spring back in. 
I was very happy with the product I purchased and I received it in a timely fashion.  The product was not worn nor used.  It was as if I bought it at the store at a lower cost.  It was a win/win for me.Thank you
I've been wanting this forever and when I got it,it was totally AWSOME!! First it comes with a really,really cool chair (that you are going to LOVE!),it also comes with a SWEET guitar with amp (FYI. the amp has some really cool stickers on it) and it also includes two (2) guitar magazines. I truly LOVE this piece mainly because I've always wanted an amp for my guitars. Oh,I HIGHLY,HIGHLY recommend this you'll LOVE it! Well hope this helps. :)
This Emperor Penguin Puppet is a real hit with my 5 year old.  We almost never use it as a puppet but rather as a plush toy/pal.  This penguin looks round and pregnant, but to my kid, this penguin is a perfect friend.  He has pretty much outgrown all of his plush toys, but for some reason, this one has a place in his heart and in his imagination
My six month old enjoys this.  It can keep him occupied for 10-15 minutes at a time, and the music is quite pleasant and soft.  Good toy
We received Boggle Jr as a gift at Christmas. My daughter is almost four and absolutely loves this game. She is learning her words and is learning to spell. This is a wonderful game for learning picture recognition and verbalization and moving on to spelling three and four letter words. I told my sister and she requested it for her son. He's a happy camper with the game, too
Fisher-Price is bringing back old time well-made toy construction with their Peek a Blocks! I have 4 kids who are 5 and under, and I have to say that they ALL get use out of these blocks! If you love Peek a Blocks, please feel free to join my Peek a Blocks group at Yahoo Groups:http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fisherpricepeekablocks/It is completely free and we have been having some interesting discussions on there about unknown secrets of Peek a Blocks! 
I just bought this doll @ Toys R Us and I was also able to purchase The Hilary Duff Shopping Sisters doll which is supposed to include her sister Haylie Duff which isn't available yet. I have the two other Hilary dolls the first of which was released in 2002 or 2003 and it was a Lizzie McGuire doll which doesn't look much like Hilary at all. Then there was the Hilary dolls released by Playmates which had a more slight resemblance than the first doll. Now Mattel has made a doll of Hilary Duff and it is by far the most visibly accurate doll I've seen. And the clothes and accessories are really cute too. I think a lot of girls would love this doll and possibly older fans too. I'm just waiting for the Haylie Duff doll to debut early next year and her doll also bears a striking resemblance. The dolls are available @ Toys R Us, KB Toys, Wal-Mart all under $20.00.
My son received this toy for his first birthday!  I will be purchasing it as gifts for all my friends!!  He LOVES pushing the button and listening the the music.  I was wondering if he would be able to figure out the gears, but he has caught on very quickly and loves to take the gears off and put them back on.  He also enjoys stacking the gears up and watching them go around!  I like that it has a handle so he can carry it around with him.  It keeps him involved for up to 20 minutes at a time!  It is very durable as he carries it around, has chewed on the gears (which are made of strong plastic and cannot be marred by chewing on them).My three year old also likes to play with it!  Her play is a little sofisticated with it as she tries to figure out which gears have to be put where (as in, do they have to be next to the middle spinning one) placed to make them spin and how many can be stacked and they still turn.My one wish is that Playskool would include a few extra gears.  We have them everyhwere in our house and cannot always find them all.  It would be great if they had a place where you could purchase extra ones for replacements and/or to have extras for stacking.This is an awesome toy that the kids love, can learn from, and is very durable!  It is a must have!
We live in Alaska and really wanted two of these games to pass on to our married daughters since it has been a holiday tradition to play.  We found them for purchase on Amazon but were displeased at the cost to ship to Alaska.  Although we are part of the US and USPS ships for a reasonable price, we weren't given that option and paid at least double what it could have been.  UPS and FedEx rip off those of us in Alaska while USPS treats us just like everybody in the Lower-48.  Give us a USPS option
My son received this one as well as the other colorfelt toy.  He was not impressed with it in regards to playing with it on his own.It does work well for teaching and using it as a toy that we can play together.
Nursing Nana is a great gift. It is soft and cuddly, and the puppies attach with magnets, giving a realistic nursing "tug" as you attach and detach them. This would be a great gift for a child when a second or third child is being born to take the angst out of mom nursing the new baby. It is a bit smaller than I anticipated, but it is still worth it because it is well-made
I started playing this game in it's original German version. Which, went through some revision as the expansion decks were put out. As a result, the english version may end up being a little more together as you get the expansion decks. Talk about a wonderful game to play for two people! It is absolutely well put together, though certainly different in playing than the boardgame version of Catan. It uses the same notions, but has a far more dynamic involvement within the game play itself. The expansion packs are absolutely great, and overall add lots of options and twists to the play of the game. IT takes a couple of hours, and a signicant amount of table space. It travels well enough in it's box, but to actually play it you need time and lots of space. I highly recommend it, especially if you are only two people and looking for a game that you can play that is fun, involving, and certainly full of strategy. This is one of the many wonderful games made by Klaus Teuber, and I hope he keeps coming up with winners
I recently purchased this game using a gift certificate.  My little boy LOVES it. I think it's quite interesting as well but there were several typos on the game cards.  Frankly, there needs to be better proof reading.  Was this game assembled and printed in another country other than the USA.  That would probably account for it
Vakama is very cool.You must get him!He wears the Great Mask of Concelment and comes with a kanoka disk
My son got this toy for his birthday about a year ago, when he was two. It was one of the gifts we let him pick out on his own. He loved it and played with nothing else for a week! The songs are cute and familiar to him, plus Barney talks and sings to the music. The only draw backs were that I couldn't find an off button and that it is $20+ at local retailers. I wish the toys companies would cut us parents a little slack. LOL
This chart has been an excellent way for our children to track their daily progress towards completing their weekly chores and an excellent way to begin the work for allowance process. Only draw back there really isn't enough room to track chores for more than one child
This is a must-have item if you want to add the Clock Tower to your set.  It also works well with the other "elevation" sets, particularly Mile High Mountain.The set includes the following:4 ramps (these are made from two shorter pieces that are screwed together)2 curves2 short straights2 guard rails2 end ramps8 arches (2 supports and 1 crosspiece each)The crosspieces of the arches have a picture of how the ends of the track should be aligned.  The screws are a little tough but never need to be removed.  The set is enough to run up two full levels and back down again (my son has played with this set just by itself having fun running up, around and racing back down).  You can also make two single-level bridges, a single level bridge and a ramp down from Mile High Mountain, or many other setups.This set literally adds a new dimension to a Geotrax set.  Lots of fun.  The short pieces also allow for different configurations that may have been frustrating in the past.  Definitely fun.
I loved this trike!  It was given to my son for his first birthday and he loved it.  Daycare was in walking distance (I lived in the city) and I used the trike to take him.  My son loved to hold onto the handle bars, it gave him a sence of freedom from the stroller that he hated.  My son is now three years old and I am buying a new one for my one year old. I understand some people give this product bad reviews but there is a 1-800 number that goes with the toy.  The brand  Radio Flyer is well known and the customer service line is very helpful and willing to replace parts or defects.  This is the only gift that was given to my son that I can say "I LOVE" and have had for more than just one year!  Enjoy
 This is without a doubt the best [...] we have spent on a toy for our 7-year-old son, but it isn't a toy. It's a highly functional, albeit inexpensive, metal detector. We've had it now for 3 years and take it camping, etc.It will easily find something as small as a rusty staple, and will detect a railroad spike as far as 4 1/4 inches down, very good if you consider how small the detection coil is. When camping the kids love to find and dig up ancient tent stakes, rusty nails, and the occasional coin.Adjusting the sensitivity is trivial, just hold it away from any metal, and turn the sensitivity knob until the red detector LED just goes out. Other reviewer has noted that the three-piece shaft breaks easily, which happened on ours, but a little duct tape goes a long way and this shouldn't stop you from buying one.If you get one, make sure to bury some coins and other treasures in the garden for the kids to find.PS It also really works great for locating studs and plumbing pipes in walls
We have the original &quot;Super Mastermind&quot; which is the exact same layout.  It's fun and enjoyable year after year but too many games at one sitting can cause a headache.  It's fun to watch others work at it too.  The pieces are small so should be kept away from little kids but age 10 and up seem to enjoy it.  It's a great addition to our game shelf and we are getting more to give as gifts
My daughter got this pool for her first birthday and she loves it.  This pool is big enough that I can just get in with her and we have a blast.  Because of her age I don't fill it up all the way and it still works just fine. (it just looks a little funny) I found it really easy to set up and easy enough to pack away.  I was a little confused at first when folding it up but within moments I had it put away and every time I use it I find it easier and easier. This pool is great for traveling to Grandma's house too!  I would recommend this to anyone young and old
This game is make-involve, make-think and fun. Side effects leave you much smarter. Its fun game for parties driving everyone to involvement and fun. Art of asking questions and elimination gets better and better just by playing this game !!!!!. Strongly recommended for parents who want their kids to spend time on creative and learning game, yet fun. They can be be part of game and share there thoughts. Though it recommends age 10+ might as well be good for 7+ to 100+ ..."I wish I had this game little earlier, never stop telling how much its fun and good for personality development!!
He loves the Dog. I has very happy to find him. Since Toy Story was out 10 years ago I did not thing i would ever find  Slink my Grandsons favorite
I've enjoyed playing this game with people from around the world- it seems to work best with a group of people who haven't been hanging out together since childhood. It gets people talking and makes for an evening of all sorts of interesting stories- and you get to find out what interesting people your friends are
This was a christmas gift, however I can rate it on the base that I own one just like it.  This is good for a lifetime of fun
My mother-in-law purchased the sandbox for my son, who was not quite two at the time.  He has played with it everday for the last four months straight.  I can't even hide it from him.  He loves filling the sandbox with other trucks that he has.  This toy keeps him occupied for hours.  He has so much fun with it that we are using others for his second birthday
I bought a set of these Uno cards for my 9-year-old grandson, a Nintendo "freak." The first night he had them he played three games with whoever was handy, and spent an hour alone arranging the cards just so. He took them to bed with him. A few days later he dashed into his other grandparent's house showing off his fancy deck of Uno cards and insisted that they play a game. He even wrote us a Thank You note telling us that the cards were the "coolest present I ever got."The rules of the game have not changed, just the look of the cards. Nintendo characters, in all their bright colors, are the "suits." The cards are housed in a metal box, a throwback to the front half of the 20th Century. Excellent art work on the cards and on the box.The cards and the game are appealing to all ages. I enjoyed playing and getting acquainted with the Nintendo characters (my grandson explained them all to me). This is a great family game and this Nintendo set is a great gift. It helps close the "generation gap." I highly recommend this item. Enjoy.One last thing: I bought a second deck for another grandson and his response was pretty much the same.
Well, I just think that the little beauty on the cover easily sells this product.  Can you even imagine her tooting?  She's too cute!  The slick gentleman blowing on the whistle like it's a saxophone and he plays in a be-bop quartet of fart blowers makes me wonder if he is blowing out both ends.  This thing is going to sound like a true to life fart...but without all the hassle of the smell.  One warning...do not use this whistle on your key chain as an emergency device.  Please use a real loud whistle.  You wouldn't want to be alone in an empty parking garage with some ghoulish thug chasing you and then you just start blowing your fart whistle to get someone to come to your aid.  If I heard farts in an empty parking garage I would most likely run the other way.  This whistle is for good times only. 
This game is awesome!  It is addictive though so be prepared.  A little complicated once you get started, but becomes easier.  Best if someone already knows the game to teach it.  Really fun though
I can't believe how well made this set is. I have been looking for good quality kitchen toys for my daughter for Christmas. I wanted something sturdy and not plastic. I just received my order today and these items are great! My son opened the box and tested them for his little sister and he can't wait to play with them with her. I ordered this set and the baking set and both are made out of solid wood and are extremely durable. I am very impressed and wish amazon carried the matching coffee pot and blender!I also had a problem with the velcro on the butter.  It was an easy fix with some super glue.  I think the heat during the shipping made the velcro come off
Insta Sundae in a Can: Simply take the can and squirt some of the stuff into a bowl, cover it in whipped creamand chocolate sauce, put a cherry on top and, voila, you've instantly created a sundae
It is a little smaller than I expected...But I guess i shoulda wrote down the measurements and took a tape measure in the room before hand. Other than that, It's perfect. My son's room has an Atlanta Braves theme so the colors are perfect. The main reason I bought this was to use as a toy box. So far, it's worked out great! I don't have or plan to put books on top so the fact that the bookends are small don't bother me. The only thing I have sitting on top is a teddy bear and a piggy bank.
I purchased the 12-Prank Kit for my 83 year old aunt this past Christmas.  On Christmas Morning, as everyone opened the usual boring gifts of knit sweaters and scented candles, my elderly aunt carefully tore open her Prank Kit.  It was an instant hit!  As she laid out her Fake Dog Poop on the floor next to the Christmas tree and blew her new Fart Whistle, everyone started to roll with laughter.  Oddly enough, this inexpensive little gift became the high-point of our family Christmas gift-giving.  Maybe that sounds pathetic, but my Aunt was carried back to younger days when she used to pull pranks with whoopie cushions on her little nephews. Thanks to this great little package, we all laughed so hard it hurt.  What an awesome gift
My daughter (15 months) literally started running in place with excitement when she opened this baby doll, which was a gift from my best friend.  I've NEVER seen her react like this to any gift. My daughter has continued to bring this baby doll around with her everywhere--usually she just ditches her toys and plays with the tupperware. The doll has a soft, squishy body that makes her cuddley despite the fact that she has, as my husband is constantly saying, "a hard plastic head." 
"The Changeling" has become a little bit dated, however, it is still a very good ghost story. The film stars (George C. Scott) as John Russell, a composer who has lost his family in a tragic accident. He rents a large estate in order to compose his music. It is here that he encounters the ghost of a young boy. Why is the boy haunting the estate? Why is he making contact with John Russell? As the film moves forward, John Russell contacts a medium and eventually begins to investigate the mansion.From what he can gather, it was the former home of Senator Carmichael (Melvin Douglas). What ensues is the mystery of who the child is, and who is Senator Carmichael. What occurred in the mansion that is keeping this child there? This is more of a mystery than a horror film. The suspense of the film is through the nuances the director created by use of creepy sounds and effects in which the boy's wheelchair moves. The film is dated, and does not have the appeal it once had for me, however, it is still a good watch. Recommended.
This movie was excellent. I have a degree in public health so this was a smash hit to me. You can gain appreciation for it on many levels. I found the investigating of HIV and the disease course tracking to be interesting. Anyone interested in politics or history would love this movie. Anyone who has been touched by AIDS/HIV themselves or in knowing someone who suffered from the disease will gain knowledge and insight from this. Anyone who is interested in government scandals or foreign relations would be drawn to the story. And mostly, anyone who can appreciate human interaction and flaws and how our sexuality is tied or not tied to our identity would glean a lot from this. The message and information is so powerful. Of course as anything brought to tv there may be slight exaggerations to the story but for the most part it accurately chronicles the struggles both political and scientific that plagued the on-set on AIDS/HIV disease spread. The same frustrations can speak for many issues and so this is not only a piece dealing with the hard topic of AIDS but, since science doesnt often make it into Hollywood, it is representative of many struggles.Matthew Modine and Lily Tomlin are wonderful
This movie is almost 40 years old...can you believe it? To those of you who haven't seen this classic, my only question to you is, why? Why in the world have you been depriving yourself of something so incredible, so wonderful, so fun, so beautiful. It is just one of those movies that makes you almost kind of sad that we don't have filmakers and storytellers like we used to. We have become a group of people who are more interested in constant action, that we have forgotten how to tell a story. We have become a group of people who desire to be constantly stimulated rather than allowing ourselves to get interested and involved. If this movie was created in today's market - and it pains me to say this - it would be a box office flop. But fortunately, it was made when it was made. Fortunately it had three of the most talented actors of our time in it; the always incredible Paul Newman, the likeable Robert Redford, and the stunningly gorgeous Katherine Ross. The combination of these three characters is absolutely magical. If they made this movie today it would probably have in it; Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck, and Jennifer Lopez. YUK! I better shutup before somebody gets a bright idea of remaking this classic movie. I cannot even imagine somebody having the gall to even try and redo this jewel of a movie.Everything in this movie is top notch. Every scene is just gorgeous and full. I was just a kid when I first saw it and I didn't fully understand all the layers that this movie contains. Now in my early 40s, I truly appreciate Roy Hill's vision. Everything seems so natural. There is nothing forced in this movie. There is nothing contrived. There is nothing but pure movie magic. If you've been waiting for an invitation to finally see this movie, consider this your invitation. But, I warn you...do not buy it if your attention span is less than four seconds. So if you've read this entire review without changing the television channel or talking on the cell phone or text messaging one of your "homies" then you passed the test and you are free to view this incredible piece of cinema
You know how every single American English class in ever single school in America has to read at least one Mark Twain book?  Well, the same circumstance should be set for this film in relation to modern American history courses.One of the best political thrillers, in all fairness it's not a fast moving film, it's a slow, intricate film full of small details that add up to one big story, and one of the absolute best American films of the 70's All the President's Men is a story of, besides Watergate, of two small worker ants who go on to destroy what already was a disasterous affair, which if not uncovered, could have potentially gotten worse.Hoffman, as per usual, hands in a flawless performance as does Redford, an actor whose work I'm none too familiar with or a fan of, and the supporting cast all around, particularly Jason Robards, shine like flawless diamonds in this essential, and inspirational, drama
I caught a glimpse of this movie years ago and I could not remember the name but I did know who stared in it...so when i went online to get the name of this I was pleased to see that the sender had it at a very good price...Thanks so much for having the movie and second getting it to me so quickly!!! Thanks again!!
   BIG fan of 80's... music and culture, and most of all The Movies.  she's having a baby is not just a teen movie like "sweet sixteen" or "breakfast club".  Its somewhat a true newly wed story with many funny moments wishing your marriage will be like that some day.  Soundtrac is great with kate bush "the woman's work".  My girlfriend cried and as i hand her the tisue when this song played.  i told her i'll feel the same if she were the wife.  boy i got lovin that nite... i would watch over and over again and the last credit when 80's famous star show their contribution suggesting the name for the baby, i thought it was clever.
I kept passing by this one in the video store. I figured that I would have heard of it if it was any good, right?Wrong. It's almost ten years old as of this writing, and I never heard of it, and it's really good. I mean, Really Good, in lots of ways. It's got characters I can really care about. There's Leaven, for one (Nicole de Boer, aka Dax of DS9). She starts out as the stereotypical wimpy, screamy girl. Then there's Quentin, who starts out the take-charge cop, the one you're sure will get our little band out of this lethal labyrinth. Just keep two things in mind. First, everyone changes over the course of the movie. Second, wanting to see some jerk get it is also a kind of caring, just not a nice one.The way the characters change is another thing to like. This movie borders on the minimalist, and its fair to say they didn't spend a terrible lot on sets and props. The characters carry everything, and do it surprisingly well. This isn't a Great Movie in the sense of literary snobishness, but still a heck of a flick. The actors, plus the script they're given to work with, really make the movie. Another bit to like is that spending thing - they didn't do much. The actors are all good, but not in the gazillion-dollar class. Sets and props are well done, but there's not much to them. Costuming couldn't have cost more than $20 for each of seven actors. All this proves that money doesn't make a movie: artists and artistic vision do. Maybe money helps, but Cube shows that you can still get a big-budget feel on a very modest budget.What's not to like? The ending. I'll let you get there on your own. Maybe that's why this movie didn't take off and make a boatload of money for everyone involved. But, they didn't spend a lot, so I hope they all went happily to the bank anyway. They deserve every nickel they made from it.//wiredweir
I have read a number of good reviews of this DVD on this site, especially the one written by Dennis Littrel. I will thus only add a small personal impression. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and being troubled by the sight of the 'good guy' so disturbed and unsure of himself. This is not what we were expected to see from Western heroes. Also troubling was the possibility that the good guy somehow might not win. Also troubling was the involvement of the good guy with another woman in a way which could not be understood by a very young person. If he had a fiancee then what was he doing with this elderly Mexican woman? I am only speaking about my own naivete of course. I too as a young person was troubled by the ticking clock and the whole mood of anxiety. This is to say that while I sensed somehow the movie is 'good' I could not because of the perplexity I felt , enjoy it.The good guy does not run. He does stand up and alone face the bad guys. His fiancee though she has principles of non- violence when it comes down to it does the 'realistic and necessary thing' to save the one she loves.A realistic moral Hollywood drama , and of course made haunting by the 'Do not Forsake me Oh my darling' in the background
I knew I should have waited!  I got impatient and bought the Masterworks DVD and after watching it once could not bear to see it again, the colors were that awful.  Of course I have to get this, but it's still galling.Now if they would only release El Amour Brujo
I'm delighted to see there aren't a string of 1 star reviews from people who don't get A Mighty Wind. If it has a weakness, its that its played so dryly, its almost like non-fiction that just happens to be funny.  Thank god for Fred Willard who adds some vitally important crassness to these "serious" proceedings.I share a sentiment expressed by some of the characters.  I've never liked folk music.  But somehow this movie manages to poke fun at those less cynical times, without being too cynical itself.My one dissapointment is that we don't get to see Ed Begley Jr. sing How's It Hangin' Grandma? in Swedish.  Talk about a missed opportunity
As popular as Prince was in the 80's, it's hard to believe it has taken 18 years for Under The Cherry Moon to find it's way to DVD.  Critics largely considered the film a stinker, especially considering it was only two years behind Purple Rain, but Under The Cherry Moon was a very good film, although very different than Purple Rain.  Shot in black and white, Under The Cherry Moon starred Prince as Christopher Tracey, him and his buddy Tricky (Jerome Benton from The Time) are living it up in Europe.  They wine and dine the rich and upper class and take their money, basically they are gigolos.  They swear it never gets personal until Mary Sharon comes into the picture.  Christopher falls for Mary in a big way, but her father Issac Sharon isn't having it.  Drama ensues. The soundtrack is awesome and includes the songs "U Need Another Lover Like You Need a Whole In Your Head," "Mountain," and "Kiss" and the DVD includes the videos for the songs shot for the film.  A must have for Prince fans.
This movie is a wonderful follow up to the first...Anne has the same charming spirit and the cast is just as wonderful as they were the first time. I highly recommend this movie to anyone
This is a good solid documentary that sticks to its subject.  The clips of Ginsberg &amp; Burroughs are especially effective.  The celeb performances in the second half are all of the work itself &amp; not just empty theatrics. The Beats are still a source to return to for inspiration &amp; insight.  The world they emerged from is not all that different from the one in which we find ourselves now.  Of course there's more, but this video gives you enough to get you started &amp; gives you enough of the good stuff to go back to late
as an asian american, i just want to say how well this movie is made.  i'm not offended that this movie casted caucasian actors (come on people, this was in the 1930s!!)  and yes, there are a few scenes that are not in the book.  but, let's count how many hollywood movies (taken from books) that can't hold a candle to it's original masterpiece.  i love the movie 'misery' but if you've read the book, the book outshines the movie by a landslide.  so yes, the good earth movie has scenes that are different than the original book, but still a very well made movie nonetheless, particularly for the 1930s.  i saw it on tcm and am looking forward to getting the dvd
i just so the uncut version of this movie and if you like perverse and grotesque movies you will enjoy this. an uncut version can be purchased at trashpalace.com check it out
I LOVED this movie. Breathtaking scenery, a simple yet enthralling story, and wonderful acting all around. No drugs, no guns, no over-the-top violence. A nice movie to watch on a rainy day....
This was a great movie.  True the Cube was a trap but it showed the greatest danger was the people inside.If you do an indepth look  you will realize  all the names of th epeople inside the cube are names of prisons in 4 different countries, and furthermore  their personalities decribe what the prison is like.Kazan (autisic guy) come from  Kazan Prion in Russia  which is a psychiatric prisonAlderson  comes from  Alderson prison in West Virginia.  This prison commonly uses isolation as a punishment.  Alderson died alone having never ran into anyone.Rennes  comes from Rennes Prison In France.  Rennes was kinda the groups mentor.  He showed them 2 tips on how to survive, the  group took these as policy.  Rennes Prison is where most of modern prison policy originated.Holloway comes from Holloway Prison in England.  Holloway is a prison for womenLeaven And Worth come from Leavenworth Prison in KansasLeavenworth has stict rules so does math wicj Leaven is a whiz at.Leavenworth was bulit corportely by architects.  Worth was an architect.Quentin comes from  San Quentin prison in California.  Both Quentin's are brutal.The makes of this movie really did their home work to make those connections.The plot was good also,  total strangers  with their memory of how they got there wiped out have to rely on each other to survive
The Hucksters does an excellent job of portraying the cut throat business that advertising is.  Clark Gable, playing the suave but ethical advertising man, is the protagonist and he is pitted against the larger than life business tycoon Sydney Greenstreet.  Both are pitted against one another in this real life chess match, each making strategic moves of cunning, self-pride and power--Gable, in an attempt at making the advertising business a respectable one and Greenstreet by instilling fear into the bumbling idiots who surround him.  Greenstreet operates as though his customers are mindless sheep easily persuaded by fancy packaging and jingles of no substance whereas Gable is convinced that the customer is intelligent and is looking for more than bells and whistles when purchasing a product. Most interesting however is the internal struggle Gable, Kerr, and Gardner are each battling.  Gable, basically a good man, is somewhat of a player and finds himself in love with Kerr.  Kerr, a widow with children, is a righteous woman deeply attracted to Gable but cannot reconcile with his lifestyle.  Gardner, a sultry singer of a sordid background, longs to settle down as a respectable housewife and mother and his her net set for Gable.  All three do a magnificent job of portraying the internal struggles of their characters.In the end Gable buckles but does not break before the formidable Greenstreet.  Realizing that he cannot continue on working for this tyrant without compromising his standards, Gable passes on the company?s lucrative offer and walks, but not before he has publicly humiliated Greenstreet.Of course, Gable does get the girl in the end.  Which one?  Watch the movie and find out!
Another great Richard Scarry video.  This video teaches kids in a way that is interesting and fun for them...without being obnoxious for their parents!  We love it
I have seen this movie in the past on TV and am familiar with the story line. I have also been to Visit Boys Town Since I have family in Omaha Nebraska. I would say if anyone is considering buying this movie, Do. Spencer Tracy makes a good Father flanigan (the Priest who starts up Boys Town) in this movie and Micky Rooney who plays a hoddlem
An old movie, but a good movie.  The end is a sad comment on the society of tomorrow.  Heston and Robertson do a great job of acting.  The pace is a little slower than current special effects of today's movies.  If you are not a fast paced dude and can slow down, then I would recommend this one for you
DVD newcomer "Fort Apache" (1948) looks great, with minimal wear on its crisp black-and-white images (from original nitrate elements) and bugle-brisk audio. The film, ironically, finds Henry Fonda playing the maddeningly hawkish cavalry commander against John Wayne's humanistic officer willing to risk all for peace and justice.The (single) DVD has no documentary on the exciting and heartfelt film, a shame. It does include a 15-minute piece on Monument Valley, covering Ford's significant and seemingly beneficial role in the Indian reservation's history. The Navajo, paid good wages for their appearances, called him "Giant Soldier." "I've kissed more babies than a politician," Ford said."Part of his vision of the world was that we're all very small in the scheme of things," film historian Joseph McBride says. "I think (Monument Valley) gives a dimension of moral seriousness to his work that was intensified as he went along."[...
This is my favorite film of all time!I am sad to say that most people have never even heard of it - It was an Acadamy Award winner, so I don't understand why it's not gotten much attention over the years...I find it  superior to other classics which seem to have withstood the test of time better than Captains Courageous.I don't know why this is the case, but I am it's biggest advocate - urging all my friends to see it...It is a wonderful and moving story, that will bring me to tears time and time again the same way as "It's a Wonderful Life Does"...If you have strong values and a warm heart - this movie is for you!Do not miss it
15 Minutes is worth the money.  It probably will not be the number one DVD in your collection, but you're sure to go back and watch it from time to time.  This film gives an interesting, if not frightening, look at the role mass-media play in our country's daily life.  We don't think about it, since we are living it... but this film gives us a view of someone who might not be used to the faced paced, 24-hour news cycle lifestyle that most of us live today.  At the center of the movie's plot is a greedy, slick breaking-news style anchor who is given the 'gift' of being the only personality in town to have the near-realtime footage of a string of murders, as they are being committed.  He has a moral pause, only for a second, before he unabashedly trumpets the news to the entire world.  The rest of the movie deals with the minds of the killers and the techniques used by the authorites to catch them.  All in all.. not the best movie out there.. but worth the money.
movies was good however the quality of the film was not very good.  screen was very cloudy at times and it was hard to see some things and the sound was not very good.  the story it self was moving.---thk
This two parter commemorates the  10th anniversary of the Arthur show on PBS. It's nice, they could have gone cheesy and just recycled old footage but they decied to be subtle about it. Really the only thing that specifically makes this a 10th anniversary show is the fact that there are '10's hidden throughout each episodes kind of like how Marc Brown hides the names of friends and family in his picture books. It's nice to see them both together too (episodes 1 & 2), I think they aired them seperately on TV
With a cable modem, took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to download Unbox, install the program and download the episode.  It's a great download speed considering the file is 803 mb.  I was able to still use my computer, IE 7.0 and RealPlayer, so the download is not a resource hog.  The menu bar includes a link to shop for more Unbox titles, which I found very convenient.  The quality is great, but the video stutters in Unbox.  Maybe because it uses 3 applications when playing video?  I chose to watch the episode on Windows Media Player 11 and I had no problems at all.I've bought and watched 3 episodes, all with the same results.  Fast and unobstrusive download, great quality and low price.  Just use WMP, or another player that can handle wma files, to watch.     
Once again, Fox has cancelled a brilliant show. While it is occasionally a bit off-color, the dialogue is brilliant, but apparently people couldn't follow the episodes, so no one watched this great show, and it was cancelled. I haven't tried the download option, but I highly recommend the show
No one will doubt that Woody Allen is the only director who has consistently mastered the art of writing and directing intelligent, funny, unforgettable stories.  These films are great examples of that. Fromk Annie Hall to Sleeper [I haven't viewed Stardust Memories yet], you will be completely satisfied with your purchase. Here's an overview of the films:Annie Hall: Allem's best film, hands down.  The story of a couple who meets in a New York tennis club.  Allen plays Alvy Singer, a carbon copy of Allen's stereotypical self [neurotic, clumsy, "suave"], while Keaton, who gives a stunning performance, plays Annie Hall, a country girl from Wisconsin trying to find a life in New York. A great story about relationships. The last paragraph that Allen narrates is fabulous. Don't watch this film first, or you may not appreciate Allen's other work as much!Bananas: On the sillier side, this film is about Fielding Mellish, another character based on himself.  Mellish works for a large corporation. Testing products. If you are at all familiar with Allen, you already know that there is a witty scene coming up.  Mellish travels to the small Latin American country of San Marcos to find something to do. He ends up becoming the communist dictator there, and that is all I will say.Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* *But were afraid to ask: A great satire on the popular book. This is a series of seven small sex stories, varying from Gene Wilder's affair with a sheep to a giant, deadly mammary. Watch for Allen's coolest role as Fabrizio, the Italian.Interiors: A stunning film [very serious] about a wealthy Long Island family that steers away from the mother. This film is beautifully shot, and it really pays a lot of attention to showing every aspect of every character. Tension builds quickly, and it stays until the end. Love and Death: One of my personal top five Allen films.  This one is about Napoleon trying to take over Russia. Allen plays Boris Grushenko, a Russian Catholic, who falls in love with his distant cousin, Sonja [Keaton].  This one is nonstop laughs, but only if you are familiar with the war and the works of Russian writers. It is still very funny otherwise, but not as deeply funny. Manhattan: Similar to Annie Hall, but a little different.  Allen plays Isaac Davis, who falls in love with a seventeen year old [Mariel Hemingway], and also with Mary [Keaton], an overly pretentious New Yorker at the same time. This story is again about relationship, but this one is extreme. Shot in black and white, and accompanied by a George Gershwin soundtrack, many Allen fans consider this film his love letter to New York City.  It is also considered his best by many people. I think he has made better, but this is a stunning film.Sleeper: Sleeper is 'Love and Death' set in the future. A great film about Allen, who is frozen in 1973, and defrosted 200 years later. Great jokes, chase scenes, and more. In one scene, Diane Keaton and a leader of a revolutionist underground organization re-create scenes from his childhood. Another joke about the NRA. Sleeper is probably the best film to see if one wants a good introduction to Allen's style. All in all, this collection is a must-own. Also, at less than ten dollars per DVD, no fan should pass this up. Separately, they cost more. Buy this today and you will be granted a good taste in motion pictures
This movie has been on my top 5 list for years.  Although the quality of the movie is poor by today's standard, it is worth it to see the transformation of this young woman.  Don't miss this movie
it is an fantastic concept for a movie plot. just how much trouble can a frozen man from the past get in? this man is even less refined than tarzan but has a better sense of humour. if your feeling down and want a pick me up this is a must see
TCM III was a good movie.It had all the necessary tools and villians to make a good horror movie.It lacked the essential characters,though.It would've done better if they had brought Chop Top or Drayton back to life.The film is about two friends headed down to Florida from Texas when they come upon a pit of decayed bodies.We already know it was Leatherface,and the two drive on.The next day,they come upon a gas station,where a crazy,yet funny gas station attendant named Alfredo work.Also making his appearance here as well is Viggo Mortenson as Tex,a redneck cowboy who gives the two friends guidance.The two take the road he suggests after a near attack and end up stranded in the woods,pursued by the evr vigialnt Leatherface armed with his trusty chainsaw.It gets the job done every time.As in the Texas Chainsaw tradition,they are captured and prepared for dinner.One of the friends narrowly escapes and must take on Leatherface with the help of an Veteran they met along the way.It's an overall good movie and I loved it
Audre Hepburns debut.  This ismy favorite movie of all time.  A romantic comedy whose characters have the highest integrity of any film I've ever viewed.  If you're not moved by this story and it's portrayal by command performances, then you're not breathing
My brother, Henry, always said this was his favorite movie. He loved film noir...(although I didn't know what that was at the time) and, of course, he loved Richard Widmark in his role. Looking back, Widmark should have gotten the Academy Award for Best Suppporting Actor for this (he was nominated) but there are many Oscar "should'ves". If you like prison/gangster movies, classic film noir, Richard Widmark, Victor Mature and, of course, Brian Dunleavy, you've gotta see/own this...if you havn't/don't already
How to steal a million was a light-hearted farce starring too skilled performers in their own right.  Audrey Hepburn is delightful as the sweetheart bedazzled by Peter O'Toole an expert in forged art works.  The two have you rooting for them in their improbable caper.  Once you remind yourself that this is all just healthy fun than you can enjoy their performances.  Greed becomes almost a worthy attribute as they endeavor to outwit the perfect security system guarding unknowingly a fake artwork.  It is all good fun as the security system is foiled without harming a hair on anyone's head.  Dishonesty doesn't enter your mind as the caper comes to a pleasant climax.  Everyone ends up with their reputation intact and some spare change jingling in their pockets.  The two stars are engaging and carefree and are so effortless in their actions that they are a joy to watch.  Mind candy doesn't necessarily have to rot your brain.  It can give you some mindless enjoyment on a quiet night
I came to this film after rave reviews from friends, so perhaps I was expecting too much. There is much to admire here; the acting is top-notch, the contrast between chatty characters and completely silent people in the opening interview scenes is well-crafted, and the plot premise itself is a fascinating one. For me, films are all about endings, and I felt in this area After Life didn't quite pay off. I didn't really buy into the romance, and wanted to know more backstory about the female character so I could care more whether she gets the guy or not.  I also thought they could have cut it a bit more - it feels 10-15 minutes too long to me. However, these are minor criticisms; it is a film I will watch again, and recommend to Japanese film fans, especially those who like the more slow-paced Japanese films such as Eureka, Moe no Suzaku and Sonatine
Can the book reviewers please pay attention. This is not the book, this is the VHS movie section. I see many book reviews, but not a single movie review. I'm glad everyone liked the book, but we need to see if the movie is any good here. I am sure it has alot going for it based upon the book, but I have seen some movies do a terrible job. What about this VHS movie? Has anyone actually seen it? Also can someone tell me how to get people to sell it for a reasonable price. Used rental copies for $22 to 125 is outrageous. One can only hope it comes out on DVD and these scalpers lose money
Fred Astaire met Ginger Rogers on the set of a previous film, FLYING DOWN TO RIO, where they were paired somewhat arbitrarily in one of those momentous decisions that, or so it seems from today's perspective, made the studio system seem to make sense.  You couldn't have really predicted the two would click on camera, for Fred's previous partner had been his own sister, and the two of them (Fred and Adele) had concentrated on the slightly nutty, zany dances together that did not require any sexual tension between partners.  (Think of the "Triplets" number in THE BAND WAGON.)  As for Ginger, nothing in her previous screen or stage work hinted at any softness or vulnerability--she was, of course, hilarious at playing the sort of hard-edged blonde tramp parts that were too vulgar for Jean Harlow to play.  So matching them up was a gamble, but it sure did pay off, even if FLYING DOWN TO RIO gave them little room to show their stuff in.  One number, the incandescent "NIGHT AND DAY, changed the way people felt about them almost instantly, and even the never-ending CONTINENTAL, the longest and most tedious dance craze ever captured on film, could not douse the Promethean spark they created.Hopefully sometime soon whoever owns the RKO catalogue will issue this gem--and its successors--on DVD.  If even FINIAN'S RAINBOW has come out on a great looking DVD presentation, why can't THE GAY DIVORCEE
A fantasy, dealing with the curse of star-crossed lovers, Ladyhawke never fail to be top-notch entertainment. The cast is exceptional, and get their characters right. It's all too easy to fall into the story and believe what's going on.Along with "Dragonslayer", this is one of the top fantasy movies. The story is compelling, the setting has a very gritty, dirty feel to it, and the location just adds to the overall feeling of living in the middle ages.This is not a movie I can just put on 'in the background' and let play while doing other things, because it suck me in every time
This movie was much better than I expected. With all the nonsense about the "NC-17" rating wooooo, I thought it was gonna be all T&A and more. Not that I don't like that, but the movie was exactly what Siskel & Ebert were saying at the time: A movie that has a plot and sexuality. NOT porn, but a truly ADULT movie. This is a movie that deals with grown up issues regarding sexuality, marriage and fidelity. Those who are to immature or whose sense of morality forbids them from whatching a movie about two adults having extramarital and love affairs, DEFINATELY will be offended and should avoid this movie.If you can watch something like that with an open mind and are interested in such a story line or you are interested in a love story that gets a little complicated and convoluted then this is for you.I am a big fan of UMA THURMAN and that only makes this movie better for me. The story gets a bit complicated as the lovers grow in different directions. This is a very "artsy" movie. It deals with comlex love and sex issues. This by the way, was the first NC-17 movie. Yes, they made that rating especially for this one, but its not anywhere as hot as SHOWGIRLS as far as nudity. (see my review of that one) I was expecially surprised to find out that this is a TRUE story about famous people.I loved it and I give HENRY & JUNE 5 stars
My niece and I love the movie. We sing Thumbelina all the time.  The movie is a treasure.I just wish it had some special features worthy of the movie
To begin with, I wish these so-called reviewers would stop giving away the plots of the movies they extol!  That said, this is a rare case (the 1st of its kind?) of a movie being better than the play it was based on.  The general framework was of course the same, but in the play Judy Holliday's part was taken by Josephine Hull, a very funny little old lady (who also scored both on Bway and on the screen in "Harvey" and "Arsenic and Old Lace," to name the only 2 that I know of), and the love interest on stage was only hinted at around the edges, it blossomed in the film.  One problem, there simply were no witty lines, either in the play or the movie.  This is odd for Kaufman (though the play was produced in 1953, very late in his career), but about par for Burrows (early in his career).  But still it was clever and interesting, the play had more structure than the movie (typical of Kaufman), but the movie did things with the plot that were suggested but left undone in the play, which surprised me very much and made me wonder about Kaufman.  Also the flick left out all the naughty words which I'm sure Hull barked out with delicious abandon!  (Note:  Kaufman co-wrote the play, Burrows adapted it for the screen.)  This I think was more a sit-com than an actually witty Kaufman comedy.  And finally, Judy Holliday did NOT play a "dumb blonde"!  She only did that in "Born Yesterday.
Eisenstein's verve has never been questioned, even if it was absorbed by living in 'dark times,' to reference Hannah Arendt. This feature is worth anyone's time as the angles of observation and superb editing defy adequate description
Although given short shrift by the few critics who watched it, this is a worthy effort, marked by good acting, direction, technicals, and an intelligent script. Although in a state of undress through much of the film, Kelly Lynch is given an opportunity to display the full panoply of her acting range as there are essentially only two actors. And, as so often with independent films, all involved have an opportunity to be truly creative. The desert setting enhanced the starkness of the extreme emotions to which the viewer is exposed.

I would reccomend this film to any Robert Johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at. It includes some great interviews with Johnny Shines, Robert jr Lockwood and others who knew Robert. Its worth it just to hear Lockwood play an unrecorded song of R.J.'s! The parts where Keb' Mo' re-enacts segments from R.J.'s life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman. My only criticism would be that there are few extra DVD features,however, that doesn't stop me watching this film again and again! A very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest Delta bluesmen
one of mikio naruse's last masterpieces was 1960's &quot;when a woman ascends the stairs&quot; - it is also one of only two of the great director's films currently available in any video format in the u.s. but wow, what an introduction it is! this seemingly modest film about a woman on the edge of a precipice, winding her way through dismal back alleys and cheap bars in search of an out is one of the great character pieces in world cinema. crisply shot in black and white widescreen (which is admirably reproduced in this edition), this beautifully directed and acted film is an absolute must for anyone interested in movies. the sadness lies in the knowledge that this kind of film is not made anymore; there's no one talented enough to pull it off nearly as well. class and subtlety are a rare commodity and this film has just the right amount of both. it's perfect, one of the greatest films of all time, one i come back to again and again
Avatar is so awesome! I saw one episode by chance and was determined to watch them all. It's got an excellent story line, great characters and awesome animation. I'd say it's the best show on TV out there right now, not just considering the cartoons either. It's got a real depth to it and isn't only fit for kids but teenagers(like me) and adults alike. Highly recomended!I don't know if the downloading was not working in the past but it's definitely working now. I've downloaded a few and they all work fine for me
What can I say if you like Clint Eastwood your going to like this movie.  I Have not seen this movie since it played at my local drive-in!  What  memories
MARIA MONTEZ, JON HALL and SABU made some very entertaining Technicolor "sand and sandals" epics at Universal and this DVD restoration showcases them in brilliant Technicolor.It's strictly Saturday afternoon matinee stuff, nothing to really ponder in the way of complex plots--just the usual good vs. evil with Hall coming to the rescue of beautiful princess Montez in her usual damsel in distress kind of role. Exquisitely photographed on desert sands, it's exotic fun fare for adults and children with lots of eye candy to keep things interesting. TURHAN BEY is effective in a brief role but it's Montez and Hall who keep the story moving along at a lively pace. Well worth viewing and nostalgic fun for fans of the Universal series starring this trio of stars
Well, of course it's that hokey romantic type.  And, of course you see the ending coming from a mile away.  Of course we've seen it all before.  But, as far as entertainment value goes, it's got it.  Reese Witherspoon proves, once again, that she can flesh out an otherwise empty character and give it some personality.  There's really not much to the characters in this movie, but there doesn't need to be.  I was a little wary of the Jon Heder character, having just come off the great Napolean Dynamite buzz.  But, I found his character interesting and didn't think he had nearly enough time to flesh it out, but he did a good job with what he had.  You don't have to bust your brain trying to figure out this one, but it works when you're in the mood for a straightforward romance.  It is what it is
I don't recall having seen a film where the actors enjoyed more playing their roles.  They seemed to have had a ball
I won't lie.  This movie sucks.  However, it is so cheesy and lame that it will make you wet your pants.  I don't care what people say, but I like the no-name actors and the wanna-be power ranger ninjas.  It is a great movie because it is the worst movie ever.  Also, I must add that the action was utterly stupid and the acting was absolutely pathetic.  :)  Great movie, though.Yes, I will agree, the plot sucks.  However, there is no plot, therefor the movie rocks.  Buy it now and own the best movie ever for two bucks used and new.  It's the corniest and cheesiest movie ever!  :
I have seen many historical war dramas from Far East (mainly China's) and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy.Yi Soon Shin, however, is a rare exception.  Not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in-fighting between the Chosun political factions (and the second-guessing nature of the king) which causes his eventual death.   Also, the special effects are great.  The battle scenes (whether on sea or land) are realisitic and of outstanding quality.The only problem that I can find is that the DVD has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the Ming China.  Then again, this is not unexpected since this is a Korean drama focusing on the great admiral.Also, the entire selection should have 104 episodes.  I don't know why it stops at 101.If you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject, try Samuel Hawley's Imjin War (which portrays Yi Soon Shin more accurately by quoting original sources).Any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out Stephen Turnbull's Samurai Invasion (which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the Japanese perspective).  Lastly, anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out Shogun:Total War by Creative Assembly (now in Gold version).
This version of Pride and Prejudice takes quite a few liberties with Jane Austen's most beloved story, but manages to endear itself in spite of that.  Olivier's Darcy will be a shock to those who are in love with Colin Firth or Matthew MacFadyen, but he does so well that you'll be charmed by him in no time.  And Greer Garson's Lizzy is as spirited as you could wish.  The costumes are all wrong, yes, and it is a little distracting for those of us who revel in Regency dramas, but once you get over that, and immerse yourself into the story, you'll be swept away.  Highly recommended
This is an HBO remake of the original 50's 50 footer. Naturally there had to be some adjustments for the new era. However it still captures the thrills and chills. You may also marvel at the spandex clothing that stretches for ever (rats.)Nancy (the little woman) does not have quite the devoted husband. Here life is not quite ideal. Soon a chance encounter with aliens (the space type) leaves her feeling bigger about the situation. 50 foot bigger. Now it is Nancy's turn for a little revenge. The ending is a little unnerving.Be sure to see Daryl in just as serious of a role in "High spirits" (1998)
I rented the movie and I havn't seen the first three but this one was pretty good. It wasn't the absolute best horror film but good pace of the movie, good plots and story line. I don't recommend going out and buying it  righ away cause you should rent it first and decide for yourself
its easy to state facts when you talk about the quality of a power tool or a tv.  but when it comes to things like movies and music, its all a mater of opinion.  my idea of a great movie might be your idea of the worst movie ever made.  so its not a good idea to buy or not buy a movie based on someones opinion of it.  i liked this movie in fact i just watched this movie 5 min before writing this.  if you are not sure if its your cup of tea rent it before buying it. i seen it 10 times over the years and i still like it
Download takes awhile, but the picture quality was great, even full screen. It played all the way through. And, to boot, it's an excellent show
Nobody is safe from satire, not even Alfred Hitchcock. But Mel Brooks straddles the line between parody and affectionate homage in "High Anxiety," a hysterical psychiatric comedy that deftly references all sorts of Hitch films -- while keeping in Brooks' trademark slapstick, hilarious dialogue, and weird characters. Dr. Richard Thorndyke (Brooks) has just been hired as the director of Psychoneurotic Institute for the Very, VERY Nervous, after the sudden death of the previous administrator. Something odd seems to be going on -- screams are heard, a patient signals Thorndyke with a mirror, and Dr. Charles Montague (Harvey Korman) frightens a patient into fits. Then one of the doctors dies mysteriously, while trying to leave the conspiracy. And when Thorndyke is lecturing at a psychiatry convention, the evil Nurse Diesel (Cloris Leachman) sends a hired killer (wearing a Thorndyke mask) to frame the doctor for murder. Now Thorndyke must elude the police and the killer, clear his name with the help of a mysterious blonde heiress (Madeleine Kahn), and overcome his crippling "high anxiety." As a homage/spoof, this is gold. Brooks deftly weaves together elements and storylines from various Hitchock movies, including "Vertigo" and "Spellbound," with some nods to "Psycho," "North By Northwest" and "The Birds." There's dizzying looks down a wooden tower, newspaper "stabbings" in the shower, and Madeleine Kahn's strange not-so-icy blonde. But it's also a great movie in its own right. Rather than outright slapstick as in some of his movies, Brooks instead crafts a clever thriller framed with delicious comedy -- he even makes fun of some standard filmmaking devices. For example, Thorndyke's hotel suite is switched for a top-floor room because of a call from... "a Mr. McGuffin." And he fills it with hysterical comedic situations, like Victoria mistaking the sounds of a life-or-death struggle for a phone sex pervert, or Thornduke being assaulted by a crazed bellboy. And his dialogue is solidly quotable in this one ("Those who are tardy do not get fruit cup"). The highlight has to be murder-by-bad-pop song, where a man is trapped in a car with the unspeakably bad "If You Love Me Tell Me Loud Loud Loud." Gene Wilder wasn't available when this was made, so Brooks took the lead himself. The seriousness of the character doesn't entirely fit him, but he's a solid enough Thorndyke, especially when he has to give a G-rated speech about penis envy. Most of the comedy comes from an unfortunately blonde Madeleine Kahn as the chic love interest, as well as a ghoulish Leachman and S&M enthusiastic Korman ("Too much bondage, too much bondage, not enough discipline!"). And Ron Carey and Howard Morris round the cast off, as the photographically obsessed chauffeur and the stereotypical little German shrink. "High Anxiety" is an affectionate parody/homage to Hitchcock -- even Hitchcock was pleased by it -- but it's also a solid comedy movie. Definitely worth seeing!(Stalking, R-Hag?
Talk to her is an unforgettable masterpiece about two female coma-patients and the men who nurse them. Provocative and colorful, Almodovar's film keeps the audience on the jump with stupefying plot-turns and as usual he makes short work of  small-minded moral ideas. His piety is seasoned with humor, the entire film a tightrope-act on the border of good taste - but afterwards you will say to yourself: thank God that I have seen it!One of the patients is Lydia, a proud lady-matador and a diva after Almodovar's heart. She spends her life reckless on the passing-lane and celebrates her own image. But life outside the arena exceeds her orbit and her prominent lover drops her. Talk-show host Marco takes her by storm when he kills a snake in her kitchen ("I respect other people's phobias"). Their passionate affair develops into an armament-race and soon the day comes when Lydia faces the bull that is her match. The fight was unfair from the start: the poor creature was stabbed in the neck before being chased out of its box. Marco feels guilty and flamenco-singers set up a wail. Her brain is dead, she has no thoughts, no feelings and the doctors tell Marco that, while there is no hope, miracles happen.Lydia's fellow-sufferer in the coma-ward is Alicia, a pretty young ballerina, four years ago the victim of a car accident. Her boyfriend Benigno looks after her since then. He sponges her down, dresses her, gives her eye-drops. He is her masseur, her physiotherapist and female viewers will resent this violation of their privacy. He cuts her hair so that she will feel no difference when she wakes up. And he speaks to her, mostly about ballet. He believes in miracles and treats Alicia as if she were alive, while Marco treats Lydia as if she were dead. He is afraid to touch her and takes his notebook to her room...Benigno is the film's secret star and one of Almodovar's most endearing heroes. He spent years of his life as subjugated nurse of an exploitive mother and is very much in touch with his feminine side. Others take an interest in his sexual orientation; he thinks it's beside the point. Irrelevant. And he displays unselfish devotion for the woman he loves.When Alicia's father - a psychiatrist - is concerned about Benigno's virginity he has the presence of mind to pretend that he prefers men. The good  doctor - who considers virginity as perversion (!) - is reassured and entrusts him with his daughter's care. And when Marco inquires: "What do you know about women?" Benigno replies: "Everything. I spent twenty years of my life with one, four years with another". Benigno was actually not Alicia's boyfriend, just her secret admirer, but he confesses: "the last four years have been the best of my life. I do everything that amuses her, except travel".Benigno's unshakable optimism irritates the others. Alicia's father restrains himself when he sees the boy's hand on his daughter's thigh, and Marco does not understand why Benigno considers his relationship with a brain-dead woman as mutual. But he sneaks into Alicia's room and wonders what she has that Lydia doesn't have...Marco gives up when he learns that Lydia deceived him with her ex who asserts his claim: "I want to spend more time with her". Marco replies:"Feel at home" and Benigno asks: "Did you separate?".Silent films were Alicia's other passion beside ballet and Benigno feels so much empathy that he dreams in black and white. The dream sequence is the film's most memorable scene and a cross between "the incredible shrinking man", Gustave Courbet's painting: "the origin of the world" and Alfred Kubin's drawing: "Death leap". An egoist shrinks, explores his girlfriend's body and returns to the place her came from...The film takes a highly sensitive turn when Benigno voices his intention to marry Alicia. Marco is shocked: "You can also talk to plants, but you don't marry them!". Benigno is placed in a bad light when the doctors find  out that Alicia is pregnant...The film's exquisite monstrosity lies not in Benigno's act but in Almodovar's conclusion: Coldness kills women, true love brings them back to life. Benigno's "act of love" lies somewhere between rape and necrophilia, and yet Almodovar does get away with it. Perhaps because he is willing to sacrifice his star, perhaps because he is so ingratiating. Women are convinced that he understands them, men are tempted into testing the unknown. He gives the audience suspense and the critics art. He is the favorite..

I thought that Supernatural would just be another Sci-Fi thriller, but then I started watching it and was surprised to discover that there is real plot line and character development. I think this show is wonderful and would recommend it to everyone
Totally psychotic Wedding Dress designer kills his models to 'find himself', but his horrible wife has her own willpower to wield. Bava's direction parallels the edge of John's insatiable drive to Kill, an assaultive film experience. Low budget. Horrible sound, so play it loud! (6/7
Firefly is a fantastic series.  My wife and I watched the DVD set from and found ourselves rationing the episodes towards the end, because we didn't want the series to be over.  Great cast, great plots, great music.  I really can't say enough about this series.  I have never enjoyed a season of any show more than I enjoyed Firefly, and everyone I've introduced to it has loved it as well
Scooby Doo rocks!  This was an awesome episode, and an awesome way to download some of the earlier episodes of Scooby.  Fun stuff, and an inexpensive download
I have watched most of the BS series and this is one that shows what is happening to many of our american organizations. Religious control
One of the first of the great Ealing comedies, and a clear indication that their comedies would carry social and political weight as well. In this picture a run-down section of London discovers a horde of burried treasure when a bomb left over from WW II explodes accidentally, and the residents of Pimlico, London, learn that they actually are a part of Burgandy, as deeded by the King in the 1400s. This means they are a separate country right in the heart of London, and they decide to act like a separate country. Thus they conclude that the laws of England don't apply anymore - but likewise England cuts them off, and Pimlico is under siege. The craziness of the situation leapfrogs, with passports now required, services cut, people throwing food over the barbed-wire fence to help them survive. It's a great satire on government and sovereignty. It's also an interesting look at post-war London, with its burned-out buildings still plentiful and ration books still in use (England felt very much at the short end of the stick after the war, the last of the allied countries to be under wartime restrictions and shortages). The script is terrific (typical for Ealing productions), and Stanley Holloway is wonderful as the leader of Pimlico. Definitely worth a watch
There is a good reason you'd want to buy this from Amazon. The quality. Sure, you can watch it for free on CBS, but the quality isn't very good. It's streamed and the bitrate (quality) is low. Personally, I want to watch Survivor on my 50" plasma, not on my computer screen. So, I use Unbox + Windows Media Center to make that happen. Survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider.
I have loved watching this movie through out the years on TV when offered. The original "Road Trip". Kevin Costner's best movie in my opinion
I have a friend who looked for a year for this movie on dvd in brick and mortar stores, I ordered it for her and she had it in a week, and by the next week, she'd watched it ten times. Its a very good movie
I got the movie I wanted.  I saw it one summer many years ago and was never able to find it.  It was never played on tv that I saw.  It is a very touching movie and it is a true story.  I love watching true stories.My daughter orders from you a lot and this is the first time that I have did it and I got what I wanted.  Thanks so much......
I love this DVD!  I took karate for awhile and was pleased to find that the correct form is really emphasized in the kicks and strikes.  Kathy Smith brings her enthusiasm and experience, and Keith Cooke and Kelley Roberts bring their knowledge of kickboxing in particular.  It's a great workout
great casting, dancings and performance. well, if you keep abusing yourself, nobody can save you. this so talented broadway genius simply couldn't himself to mess up many women's lives and stubbornly doing harm to himself, chain-smoking, addicting to prescriptioned drugs, sleeping around, hopping from one woman to another. he created so many personal disasters around himself, dedicated himself to broadway musicals but never took care of himself. burning his own life candle from both ends day and night. when the curtain in the theatre falls, it would go up again in the next evening, but when the curtain of your life decides to come down on you, it won't go up again. a wonderful movie with a hidden warning lesson to those who in the entertaining show biz
I have loved this movie ro years and was thrilled to find it on Amazon!  The story line is cute, the acting is witty, and if you have ever loved a musical, this is for you!  There's even an interlude with Tom and Jerry.   Fun movie
"Koyaanisqatsi" took seven years to make, from 1975 to 1982. There is not a narration to tell you what to think. This is an art film, in my opinion, the value is up to the viewer: Is this film meaningful? Does it have value? As a viewer I say yes. This film is a fusion of music and image. In Koyaanisqatsi there are 17 pieces of music and five movements all have relative relationship to one another. The "Grid" is a polyrhythmic piece of music. There are 11 polyrhythimic structues going on at once, and it matches with the time lapsed photography that is occuring on screen. About 350,000 feet of film was shot. There definitely was a method to this madness: after the explosion of the Grid, these polyrhythmic structures settle the audience down and the film ends the way it began: a rocket ship taking off.Godfrey Reggio more than expected a negative reaction by some people when he made this film. What does this film mean? That is up to the viewer, like a piece of art work there may be a thousand or more interpretations related to this film. Is this film only for certain individuals? Probably. But I don't think there is any pretense in interpretating this films message. One does not have to pretend to like or dislike an art object; it has no intrisic meaning or value only what can be ascribed to it by the viewer.Godfrey stated that Koyaanisqatsi is related to Northern Hemisphere societies; super-sophisticated, hyper-industrial, technological grids that we call societies. To me this film is about how humans have become one with machines. And how we don't live with nature any longer. We have become not affected by technology so much more that we have become so engrained in it we can no longer see out of it. That technology becomes the host in which everything happens and in that way, we do not use technology, it is a way of life. But like the air we breath we can not distance ourselves, as we deny that we are separate from technology and instead of moving us toward control of nature it has alienated us instead. The norms of nature no longer fully exist; it is rather the norms of technology that do. And in so doing technology has become omnipresent. Personally I don't have to pretend to like this film or pretend it is important. In fact it is, as its message is perhaps even more significant today as the world moves even closer to a homogenized society at the expense of natural and human diversity.This film shows that homogenization is in this process of globalization
Run time was 48 minutes.  A stellar documentary.  The download worked perfectly.  Hope the review was helpful.  ty
"In Old Chicago" was a blockbuster movie made in 1937, a box office smash which contributed significantly to the emergence of 20th Century Fox as a major studio. Seeing the roadshow version of this film makes one wonder why Fox bothered to put the shorter version on the DVD because you will never view it again.  All of a sudden, the dramatic portions of the film make better sense, with the smooth continuity of a Henry King directed film and notably missing from the shorter version.  All the principals' performances improve too because what seemed quite superficial now has more depth.  For example, instead of being told Don Ameche is an honest lawyer, we SEE him in action; instead of being told Tyrone Power is a crook, we SEE him offering bribes. Power, in particular, is very convincing as the charming Irish rogue.The story is a corny tale of the O'Leary family and has that hokey quality which undermined a lot of Fox's big productions. By the time you have heard for the third time that "We O'Learys are a strange tribe", you can almost hope that they suffer some unspeakable death when the fire starts! Alice Faye plays Belle Fawcett, the dance hall attraction whom the crooked Power marries.  This was Faye's bid for major stardom when she replaced Jean Harlow who died just before production began.  Faye is diffident at first but her confidence grows and the film was a great success for her.  Her version of "Carry Me Back to ol' Virginny" is memorable.  Alice Brady won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as Mrs O'Leary but there is nothing to warrant it except a good Irish brogue and the fact that she is playing a serious part for once instead of the screwball mothers for which she was typecast.The special effects which make up the last 20 minutes of the film are spectacular and really give the film the status it has retained. The DVD package contains a couple of short newsreels and a Biography program of Don Ameche but it would have benefited from a commentary for such an important film.
Even now the quality of music in this musical movie is excellent.  This brings back memories from my childhood :)  Great version of a classic
This series has just a tad too much blood for my taste... it verges on horror, here and there, which bugs me; I even like super-violent action movies just fine, but the brutally slaughtered recent corpse thing (more 'personalized' violence than killing bad guys) is not my style. This is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.Aside from that detail, I find this show totally addictive. The brothers make a 'buddy movie' effect, and the whole supernatural framework creates a sort of non-religious yet definitely spiritual effect (the big mystery being why these guys never ever are seen praying in the show; I have actually known people who had a lifestyle similar to what the show depicts, and that is central).Not to mention the young men being so passionate, powerful, strong, yet sensitive, darkly troubled from the past, sheer SEXY it's nearly intoxicating over the long run of many episodes. ;-)Anyway -- the show has an actual plot, it's well filmed and intelligently done and is well worth watching. I recommend it
I had forgotten how awesome this movie is- even for a grown-up, like me. It could do without all the songs (it was made before Disney wisely decided to ditch all the cheesy singing,) but it's brisk, double-layered humor more than makes up for it. Kids will think the gags are sufficiently silly. Adults will pick up on the nearly-sarcastic, nearly risque dialog, so rare in Disney animated movies. Plus, Big Foot dancing to 'Stayin' Alive' is just freaking hilarious. Basically, it's just a Disney movie. But it's a *great (and severely under appreciated) Disney movie
In the late 80's to early 90's, Mickey Rourke may as well have been a porn star. Hell, every movie Rourke was in he was playing the same character who got a different hot chick...They were big-screen soft core porn films. Problem is, Mickey Rourke is so good at playing these characters that the movies he's done aren't that bad. Here, Rourke plays Wheeler...Who won't really enter into the synopsis for a moment. Rourke's ex-wife Carre Otis plays Emily, a young International lawyer who recieves a job with a big firm in New York and is hastily sent to Rio De Janeiro. In Rio, with her boss Claudia (Jaqueline Bisset) away; Emily begins to come into contact with sex almost everywhere she goes. Then, she meets Wheeler. Wheeler is that odd, soft-spoken, rich, womanizer guy every guy wishes they could be. Wheeler is the guy who says stuff to women in movies that we would never be able to get away with, but onscreen it just looks so damned easy. Anyway, unlike "9 1/2 Weeks", Wheeler and Emily don't just begin having sex. In fact, the big sex payoff isn't until the final minutes of the movie. And let's face it, if you rent this movie...You're not renting it for the story. Truth is, the story's not even that intriguing or event good for that matter. The whole movie has a plot like a soft-core porn movie. Thing is, Otis and Rourke have enough charisma on screen to pull of a movie like this. So, even if you ignore the sex, the movie isn't that bad. I, personally, think it's better than 9 1/2 Weeks. Fact is, even if you don't give a damn about the story. Carre Otis is f**king hot, so check it out.GRADE: B+
My first viewing of the campy film Secretary could not have been more ironic because I had been working as a secretary -- ahem, assistant -- for a solo practitioner for only two months. I recall leaving the theater feeling empowered despite knowing that the next day I would have to fetch whatever my boss wanted, when he wanted it. There are bosses, not just the lawyers, who long for the old-fashioned secretary. Bravo to the filmmaker for rendering Secretary's unflinching revelations about emotional pain as unsettling as its erotic depictions of the catharsis of that pain. I found, and still find, the film to be a surreal and vicarious pleasure. Not that what ensues between the boss and assistant in Secretary is unrealistic. Perhaps you know of a solo proprietor whose temp secretaries kept quitting but who now has a full-time assistant. Why is that assistant a perfect match? Intellectually, I admire the filmmaker's courage in commenting poetically upon the ways in which American society conditions women to be passive and to devalue themselves. Leave it to an art/indie film to expose how some (or many?) American women find themselves either stuck in a time warp of adolescent vanity or suffering through existential paralysis. Because American women are taught to identify and value themselves through their relationships with men, it is a total thrill in Secretary to watch the script flip the stereotype of the skirt-chasing boss on its head. In terms of casting, I cannot imagine anyone but Maggie Gyllenhaal in the title role. Her secretary is like the repressed alter ego of Elizabeth Taylor's Maggie the Cat on that hot tin roof -- full of angst but no less smoldering. Maggie G. appears to purr rather than speak. James Spader, who once upon a time seemed typecast as a snooty yuppie, gets the chance in Secretary to fully realize his erotic potential. While his character can be viewed as tongue-in-cheek, he delivers a genuinely quirky and sensitive performance. When you get down to it, the various vicarious experiences in Secretary will please some and repulse others. For me, I received instant motivation to strive for accuracy in transcribing my boss's future dictation
I LOVE this DVD, in fact I purchased 5 to give as Baby Shower Extras!I originally taped it from HBO, and my 3 Grandchildren almost wore it out!I was delighted to see it available on DVD, so I bought 5, and am keeping one in my DVD Library for my Great-Grandchildren some day to enjoy!
"Never Say Never Again" is a fantastic action thriller directed by Irvin Kershner. It is the remake of "Thunderball". However, it is still an enjoyable action packed adventure movie. Sean Connery plays his role brilliantly, despite his age (53). This is vintage Sean Connery, an older, wiser and audacious man. He has not lost his touch with ladies. Kim gives a good performance as the bad guy's pal. Barbara Carrera performs her role as the sexy, clever and wicked Fatima Blush very well. Klaus Maria Brandauer is also a remarkable villain while Irvin Kershner's direction is commendable. Rowan Atkinson makes an interesting and amusing appearance. Among some of my unforgettable scenes are the opening war-game teaser, the battle with Lippe at Shrublands, and a great motorcycle chase. Despite his age, Connery is surprisingly very fast, agile and very witty.The plot is sound and interesting. A SPECTRE agent under the command of Ernst Blofeld infiltrates a US Air Force base located in the United Kingdom and steals two Tomahawk cruise missiles. James Bond must find them before they are detonated. The characterization is superb and I liked the ending.
Bones is one of my favorite TV series. This one episode I missed so I had to get it to keep on track. Great show even if you have never seen it from the begining
it was 13 years ago when i frist saw this movie and i simply loved it to death, then as said in the song &quot;little jackie paper found time for other things and came no more&quot; it was then last week when i herd the song on a local radio station and it all came back to me, i had to see this movie again. memroys came running back from my childhood came running back. this is a great movie for all
This is a neat little movie about a 12-year-old boy (Anton Glanzelius) who tries to make sense of his mother's terminal illness, death in general, and a world full of change. He tries to cheer his mother up as best he can, but she is too far gone to really notice or care. His fondest memories are times spent at the beach with her when she was healthier and their times together were better. As a coming-of-age movie, sex plays an important (and confusing) part for the boy, from the old bedridden man in the upstairs apartment who likes him to read the lingerie ads to him, to the tomboy who is the best soccer player on his team and keeps trying to show him her breasts. The movie is full of wonderful, insightful touches. Glanzelius is marvelous. A real gem of a movie
Some of the best lighting I have ever seen on face of that hunk C. Tommy.  John Peters is a genius
Wild Orchid.  Most people think its some smut movie with no plot.  No one ever looks between the lines.  It may have sex, and some crazy acting, and even a bogus plot, but the theme of it is important.  True love.  Call me sentimental and a hopeless romantic, but this movie touched me.  Emily and Wheeler, opposites in every way, somehow find love, together.  I wish everyone was as lucky.  To find happiness where you least expect it.  I wish I could be as happy as those two.  Look around you.  Do you see people with this kind of passion and love?  It's sad, too, because we know what happened to the actors who played these lovers.  I hope that someone out there has a relationship like this so that we have more to cling to then fiction.  It may not have been the best movie, but it had an important message:  When you find true love grab it with both hands and never let go. 
"When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully" - Samuel JohnsonMichael Keaton gives an effective and heart-felt performance as Bob Jones, a young, successful PR executive married to a beautiful woman (Nicole Kidman) who is expecting their first child.  The bottom falls out of his life when he is diagnosed with a fatal illness, and only given months to live.  He is forced to exam his life that he's really just been rushing through.  Bob Jones not only has never stopped to smell the roses; he hasn't even noticed that they are there at all.'My Life' is a realistic portrayl of what must go through one's mind when one is brought up short by such stunning news.  Although the topic is certainly depressing, it is something we will all one day face.  This is how one man deals with the terribly bad hand he has been delt.  Especially poignant is the fact that not only won't he probably be around to help raise his child, but he might not even make it long enough to see his child born.  Heart-wrenching.In several pivotal scenes, Jones decides to hope for a miracle, and visits an Asian healer (Haing Ngor who starred in 'The Killing Fields')who tells him that he has too much anger and hurt in him.  Jones resists the whole notion of exploring how he got to where he is, at least for a while.  His anger at his family is one point of anger he must struggle with.Keaton does an excellent job here.  We see flashes of the actor we saw in 'Mr. Mom' and earlier movies, sort of a lovable, good-hearted guy with a funny edge to him.  His Bob Jones evolves slowly and realistically from a man who is stunned and angry, to a man determined to let his child know who he is.  Ngor also plays the right note as a practioner who can't cure his patient, but perhaps can help him in his last journey.A potentially maudlin, down-beat subject is handled with just the right amount of empathy and gentleness and with a light touch.  Highly recommended.  Very highly recommended if you've had such a scare, are living with a terminal illness, or have had a loved one deal with such issues
100 Men and a Girl is Rank Sentimentality with a Great Sound Track.  It deserves to be on DVD for the sound track alone.  Durbin's rendition of the Mozart Alleluia sends chllls down the spine
In the sequel to "John Carpenter's Vampires", Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi, who takes James Woods place) is a professional vampire killer who has been assigned to terminate The Vampire Queen in Mexico Uma (Arly Jover).  Along the way he assembles what terns out to be the most montley of crews in vampire hunting history.  Zoey (Natasha Wagner), a girl who is strung out on vamp blood.  A priest who hasn't quiet taken his vows yet.  And last but not least a black redneck mercenaery.  Guys, this is what it is.  Actually it isn't too bad.  Bon Jovi is not the world's greatest thespian (his antics in concert are amazing though).  Don't quit your day job, Jon.  But he still has a certain charm thaat gets you through the film's rough spots.  Arly Jover was cast because she looks good naked, period.  This is a low budget film, but vet horror director Tommy Lee Wallace knows how to make it streach and give us a good time.  Just don't be looking for high atr
GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT CONDITION AND AS ALWAYS SHIPPED QUICKLY AND IN GOOD SHAPE
I don't have television, haven't for 11 years. When I learned CBS was allowing free viewing over the internet I checked it out and started watching episodes of CSI, CSI NY, CSI Miami, and NCIS. I found NCIS to be my favorite and this particular show Dead And Unburied is my favorite so far. I enjoy the light-heartedness of NCIS. So I decided to download this episode from Amazon Unbox.I really wish Amazon Unbox would allow me to burn shows I've purchased. As it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer. When Unbox expands this service to allow me to burn DVDs I will likely purchase many more shows this way. I like selecting individual shows
I have the VHS tape of JANE EYRE, starring Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles. Felt both characters were well-cast, with the quiet and sensitive Fontaine as Jane Eyre, and the brooding, inscrutable Orson Welles as her employer, Mr. Edward Rochester. The black-and-white movie is more suitable for this genre, in my opinion, than the color version, as it depicts more accurately the brooding and eerie qualities of Thornfield Hall, the Rochester residence where his mad wife (of whom Jane knows nothing) is shut up in one of the towers in an unused part of the house with her "keeper" Grace Poole.  I felt the acting as well as the cinematic quality of this movie accurately reflect the atmosphere that Charlotte Bronte was trying to portray in her novel. 
WHAT MOST PEOPLE FAIL TO REALIZE IS THAT MOST LIFE STORY MOVIES ARE NOT MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF GLORIFICATION TO THE VIEWER, BUT TO LET THEM KNOW OF THE REAL LIFE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF THAT PERSON. HOW CAN YOU CRITICISE SOMEONES LIFE STORY? TO GO THREW WHAT THEY WENT THREW TO SEE WHAT THEY SAW, AND TO EXPERIENCE LIFE THREW TIMES WHEN LIFE WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GRASP? I THINK JOSEPHINE BAKER WAS A VERY GREAT PERSON REGARDLESS OF HER NATIONALITY ANYONE WITH THE GUTS TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST AND OVERCOME IMPOSSIBLE BARRIERS DESERVES MUCH PRAISE
I think this movie goes right to the heart of the philosophical question of what art and artists are supposed to be and do: are they merely to present facts/ideas/personalities/images with no comment, no moralizing, no personal ulterior motives (leaving all those things to the viewer), or do they need to state clearly a moral purpose and certain direction (which the viewer can then accept or reject)?Martin Sheen is Kit, a garbageman working in South Dakota; he becomes friends with 15-year-old Holly (Sissy Spacek). When her father tells Sheen he doesn't want him near his daughter again, Sheen kills him. The two run off together, living for a while in the woods like two "innocents" of some primitive society. But then they're discovered by three men and Sheen kills them, too. They now head for Montana, Sheen committing more murders along the way. He is empty inside, nothing fazes him; he imagines he's like James Dean - misunderstood, alienated. But he doesn't have a clue what he should be alienated against, and as far as being misunderstood, he never once gives the least hint there is anything there TO understand. We finish watching the movie feeling as empty as Sheen. I also felt a little angry at Malick's attempt to con me into thinking there is more to Sheen's vapid character than there really is: he truly is just a non-entity who kills half a score of innocent people. So back to my first paragraph. Malick obviously works from the perspective of the first half of my question posed (a view that became an obsession, I think, with artists, writers, film-makers, etc. beginning in the late 1960s); I tend toward believing the second half. Suum cuique
This episode is a bit different than the others I have seen, although I have not yet seen all of season 2 yet.  Without giving anything away, this episode shows growth in 3 of characters as human beings.  Additionally, it has some inventive guest characters.  Finally, it presents some moral and ethical questions
